 # How to import CSV files into Sqlite
1. Use [django-csvimport](https://github.com/edcrewe/django-csvimport) by installing it with `pip install django-csvimport` and `pip install messytables`
2. `python manage.py inspectcsv "<path_to_csv" > models.py`
    - This will create a model file that you MAY have to change (double check it).
    - Once you're happy with it copy the model to the relevant app.
3. Run `python manage.py makemigrations`
4. Run `python manage.py migrate` 
    - This will create the new table based off the modal 
4. `python manage.py importcsv --mappings='' --model='<app>.<model class name>' --delimiter=',' "<path_to_csv>"`
    - This will add the content to the table
