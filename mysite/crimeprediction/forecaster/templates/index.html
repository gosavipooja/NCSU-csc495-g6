            <h2>Goal</h2>

            <p>This application takes data from multiple sources including but not limited to <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/readme.txt">GHCN Weather Data</a>, the <a href="http://data.cityofchicago.org/">city of Chicago data portal</a>, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/data/developers/data-sets.html/">Census data</a> in order to estimate a variety of different crimes that will occur within a given zipcode <strong>in Chicago</strong> during a one week time-span going forward.</p>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>We created this application to satisfy the requirements for CSC495 at NC State University, a special-topics course on data driven decision making. While this application is a prototype, the practical benefits are hard to count. At the moment, it can give a user insight on how much crime will occur in a given area over a coming period of time based on data gathered over the past 5 years. These insights can guide a person on where they may want to live in the Chicago area. With further development, this application could be expanded to include other metropolitan areas as well as offer more in-depth analytics.</p>
            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <p> 
                <ul>

                    <a href="http://localhost:8000/forecaster/trends">Past Trends</a>  tab shows how the crime rate, the location of crimes, and various arrests made in those crimes has changed over the last 5 years. 
                        
                    </li>

                    <a href="http://localhost:8000/forecaster/predict">Forecast</a>  tab attempts to predict how the crime rate will be in the coming week using regression models on the historic data from the last 5 years.
