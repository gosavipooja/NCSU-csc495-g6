Primary Children's among best hospitals

LENGTH: 145 words


The U.S. News and Word Report ranked Primary Children's Medical Center 18th in
its "America's Best Children's Hospitals" category. The ranking considers
reputation, death rate and other factors. This is the first year the magazine
has ranked children's hospitals.

The Salt Lake hospital received the highest score relative to death rates,
meaning it had the lowest mortality rates during procedures than any other
children's hospital. Some of the procedures the magazine considered included
heart and neurosurgery procedures, as well as bone marrow transplants. The
scores based on reputation came from a survey of 100 pediatricians, adolescent
medical specialists and neonatologists.

The magazine included 30 hospitals in the ranking. The top three hospitals were
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Children's Hospital Boston and Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
