July 16--Hoag Hospital and UC Irvine Medical Center both made it onto this
year's list of "America's Best Hospitals" compiled annually by U.S. News & World
Report.

U.S. News creates the list by evaluating about 5,000 hospitals on 16 different
adult specialties, according to the publication.

By using factors like death rates, safety and reputation, about 150 hospitals
made it into the national rankings in at least one specialty.

Hoag, in Newport Beach, ranked in the top 50 nationally in orthopedics, coming
in at No. 49.

The hospital also performed well in nine other specialties like cancer and
geriatrics, according to the ranking.

U.S. News also proclaimed Hoag the No. 14 hospital in California and No. 7
hospital in the Los Angeles metro area.

UCI Medical Center in Orange made it into the top 50 hospitals nationally in
three different specialties.

The center was 30th for geriatrics, 47th for kidney disorders and 48th for
urology, according to the rankings.

U.S. News also ranked the center as the No. 9 hospital in California and No. 4
in the Los Angeles metro area.
