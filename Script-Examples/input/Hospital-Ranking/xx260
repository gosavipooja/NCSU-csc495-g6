May 4--Bakersfield Memorial announced Monday that it landed in the top 5 percent
of U.S. hospitals in an annual study of patient safety.

The ranking by HealthGrades, a Colorado company that provides online information
about health-care organizations, is based on a review of nearly 5,000 hospitals'
medical outcomes data from 2006, 2007 and 2008. It looked at 15 kinds of safety
indicators, from bed sores to post-operative pulmonary embolisms.

Memorial was the only hospital in Kern County, and one of only 15 in California,
to make this year's list and win a 2010 HealthGrades Patient Safety Excellence
Award.

"Everything we're doing has started to pay off," Memorial President and CEO Jon
Van Boening told a crowd of cheering hospital employees Monday morning.

Also Monday, the hospital unveiled a two-year advertising campaign set to kick
off later this month on television, radio, magazines and billboards. The ads
tell consumers, "It's OK. We're Always Thinking About You."

The hospital's vice president of business development, Gary Frazier, said the
message reflects an understanding that, more than anything else, patients "care
about coming out of the hospital better." He added that it was only by
coincidence that Memorial received the award as it was planning an advertising
campaign.
