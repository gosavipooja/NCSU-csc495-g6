LENGTH: 235  words


July 15 -- Fox Chase Cancer Center has been ranked 19th among the nation's top
50 hospitals for cancer care in U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals
2014-2015 rankings. Fox Chase was also cited as high performing in the areas of
nephrology, urology, and gynecology, as well as a new area - ear, nose, and
throat.



"Our remarkable standing in this year's U.S. News & World Report national
ranking reflects not only the hard work and mission-driven mindset of everyone
who works at Fox Chase, but illustrates the great strides our Center is making
in cancer science and medicine," says Richard I. Fisher, MD, President and CEO
of Fox Chase.

The U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals rankings are published online
annually in July, showcasing the best of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals.
The national rankings evaluate hospitals strengths in 16 adult specialties. In
most specialties, it ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals and recognizes other
high-performing hospitals that provide care at nearly the level of their
nationally ranked peers.

They are based on a number of variables, including a national survey asking
physicians to rate institutions on reputation. Among the other factors
considered are types of facilities available, specific services offered, patient
safety measures, Magnet nursing status, and selected outcomes metrics. Much of
the data is averaged over a rolling three-year period.
