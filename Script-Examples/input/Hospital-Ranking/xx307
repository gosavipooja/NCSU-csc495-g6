New Delhi, June 5 -- Once again, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota
has been recognized as one of the best children's hospitals in the country in
U.S. News and World Report's 2012-2013 Best Children's Hospitals rankings.

For the sixth consecutive year, Children's was ranked in neonatology, for the
care that it provides to the youngest and most fragile patients. Children's has
been ranked in this category since U.S. News began ranking pediatric hospitals
in 2007. For the second consecutive year, Children's was ranked in cardiology
and heart surgery, a program that is one of the largest in the region by patient
volume.

"Children's is honored to be recognized again by U.S. News. The listing is a
tribute to our skilled and dedicated staff, who are deeply committed to
providing children with the best possible care," said Alan L. Goldbloom, MD,
president and CEO of Children's.

The rankings feature 50 hospitals in each of 10 pediatric specialties: cancer,
cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and endocrinology, gastroenterology,
neonatology, nephrology, neurology and neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology,
and urology. Eighty hospitals across the country were recognized in one or more
specialties.
