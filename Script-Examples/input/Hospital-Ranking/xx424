Geriatric Care

LENGTH: 205  words


July 28 -- US's Hudson Valley Hospital Center issued the following news release:

Hudson Valley Hospital Center has been recognized by U.S. News & World Report as
among the top hospitals in the care of older adults.

According to the magazine's recently released annual report on the nation's best
hospitals, Hudson Valley Hospital Center received a regional ranking in
geriatric care. Death rates, patient safety and hospital reputation were a few
of the many factors considered.

HVHC's status as a Magnet Hospital for nursing excellence also weighed in the
decision. Only 144 hospitals were nationally ranked in a specialty.

The U.S. News & World Report ranking follows the Hospital's being chosen as only
one of four hospitals in New York State to be rated a top notch geriatric
"NICHE" hospital by the prestigious NYU College of Nursing.

In March, Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders (NICHE) released a list
of nine hospitals that achieved Exemplar status for the progress of their
nurse-driven programs in raising the level of quality in care of older adult
patients.

HVHC was the only hospital in the region to receive this honor. Exemplar is the
highest of four levels of recognition.
