OHSU: U.S. News & World Report Ranks OHSU Hospital No. 1 in Portland, statewide

LENGTH: 222  words


New Delhi, Sept. 19 -- Oregon Health & Science University Hospital ranks No. 1
in the Portland metro area as well as statewide, according to U.S. News Best
Hospitals 2012-13. The metro area includes Portland, Hillsboro and Beaverton,
Ore., and Vancouver, Wash., the news magazine reports.



OHSU's Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery - or its Ear Nose &
Throat specialty - ranks 32nd nationally. Fewer than 150 hospitals out of the
5,000 evaluated performed well enough to rank nationally in at least one
specialty.

Eleven of OHSU Hospital's adult specialties were ranked "high-performing":

* Cancer

* Cardiology & Heart Surgery

* Diabetes & Endocrinology

* Gastroenterology

* Geriatrics

* Gynecology

* Nephrology

* Neurology & Neurosurgery

* Orthopedics

* Pulmonology

* Urology

While reputation continues to play an important role in the rankings, clinical
data such as patient outcomes and processes of care have become central, the
editors report. The hospital rankings "help steer patients to hospitals with
strong skills in the procedures and medical conditions that present the biggest
challenges."

In addition to adult specialty rankings, U.S. News ranks children's hospitals,
and last month they announced OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital ranks among
the nation's top 50 children's hospitals in six specialties for 2012-13.
