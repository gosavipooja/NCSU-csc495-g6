Emory University Hospital and the Medical College of Georgia are among the
nation's top research institutions, U.S. News & World Report said Thursday in
its annual ranking.

Emory was in the top 50 - No. 48 - and MCG was close behind - No. 52 - among the
128 institutions the magazine ranked in its July 18 edition. Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore was rated No. 1 for the fifth year in a row.

The magazine also ranked hospitals by specialities. In cardiology, for instance,
Emory ranked No. 7 - moving up from the No. 9 ranking it attained in 1992-94.
