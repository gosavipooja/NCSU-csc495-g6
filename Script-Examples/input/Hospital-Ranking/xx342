--Desert Valley Hospital has been ranked "No. 1 in its Market for Value" by an
independent health care information company.

Desert Valley Hospital was awarded the distinction in the 2009-10 Hospital Value
Index created by Data Advantage, LLC. The Hospital Value Index is the only
national study which measures the value of care in U.S. hospitals.

Desert Valley Hospital was also one of two Prime Healthcare Services hospitals
to be named "Best in Value" in the study, along with West Anaheim Medical
Center. Prime Healthcare Services is an integrated health care system founded by
Dr. Prem Reddy, chairman of the board for Desert Valley Hospital. Prime
Healthcare owns and operates 13 acute care hospitals in California.

The Hospital Value Index provides an independent analysis of more than 4,500
hospitals across the country, ranking them in the categories of quality,
affordability and efficiency and patient satisfaction.

"To earn a No. 1 ranking in your state is a significant accomplishment that
deserves recognition and celebration," said Araby Thornwell, president of Client
Services for Data Advantage, LLC.

"I am grateful to every one of our physicians and medical staff for their
efforts in this accomplishment," said Dr. Reddy.
