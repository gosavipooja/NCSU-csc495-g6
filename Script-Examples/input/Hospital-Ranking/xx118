Mar. 26--VICTORVILLE -- Desert Valley Hospital is again running advertisements
touting its recognition as a Solucient 100 Top Hospital in the country, leaving
many to wonder how valuable the ranking is.

Although Solucient is a for-profit consulting fir m that contracts with
hospitals, Rick Wade, senior vice president of communications for the American
Hospital Association, says the benchmark is bona fide.

"My understanding is that, no, they do not take any money for their rankings."

The top 100 is divided into five groups: With 83 beds, Desert Valley is grouped
with 20 other small community hospitals.

Solucient's rankings are solely based on performance, namely, patient outcomes,
patient safety and "efficient care at a reasonable cost."

All non-federal hospitals that treat a wide variety of patients are evaluated.

In fact, Dr. Prem Reddy, chairman of Prime, says that the first time Desert
Valley made the list, they had no idea they were even being examined by
Solucient.

The most heavily weighted criteria are based on 21 "core measures" of treatment
for heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia that are reported to the federal
government, but some hospitals don't submit all their numbers.

In the Victor Valley, only St. Mary Medical Center has all 21 core measures
reported. Desert Valley has 15 reported, and Victor Valley Community Hospital
has 10. Desert Valley did outrank St. Mary and VVCH in every core measure it had
numbers for.
