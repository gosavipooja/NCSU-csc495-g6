Sept. 03--Lake Region Healthcare was given a "better" ranking in the September
2013 issue of Consumer Reports ranking the quality of surgery among hospitals,
the highest ranking in the magazine's scale.

According to the magazine, the ratings are based on the percentage of a
hospital's surgery patients who died in the hospital or stayed longer than
expected for their procedure. The magazine editors worked with MPA, a health
care consulting firm with expertise in analyzing billing claims and clinical
records data and in helping hospitals use the information to improve patient
safety.

A total of 34 hospitals in Minnesota were ranked, and LRHC was among 14
receiving the "better" ranking.
