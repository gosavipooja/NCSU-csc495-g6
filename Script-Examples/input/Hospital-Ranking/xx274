For the first time in two decades, the Mayo Clinic has lost its No. 2 spot in
the U.S. News World Report list of "Best Hospitals."

But it didn't fall far. Mayo, based in Rochester, is now the third best hospital
in the country, behind Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, according to the magazine's annual ranking.

"It's not disheartening," said Karl Oestreich, a Mayo spokesman. He noted that
Mayo has held the No. 2 ranking for 22 years and is still one of only 17
hospitals in the country on the magazine's "honor roll."

"We're honored to be on that list," he said.

Hospitals in 94 metropolitan areas were analyzed in the 22nd annual list.
Criteria included death rates, patient safety, procedure volume and other
objective data. Also, physicians were asked to name hospitals they consider best
in their specialty for the toughest cases.

The hospitals are ranked for 16 medical specialties. Mayo ranked as first in the
country in four areas: diabetes and endocrinology, gastroenterology, gynecology,
and kidney disease. Other Minnesota hospitals, including Hennepin County Medical
Center and Abbott Northwestern in Minneapolis, also ranked in the top 50 for
various specialties.

will go on sale Aug. 30.
