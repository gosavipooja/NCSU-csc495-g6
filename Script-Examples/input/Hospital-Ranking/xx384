Jan. 28--Altru Health System in Grand Forks is among the nation's best regional
hospitals, according to the latest edition of U.S. News and World Report's best
hospitals list.

The magazine annually publishes the rankings, evaluating nearly 5,000 hospitals
in 16 medical specialties. The rankings are based on hard numbers, including
death rates and patient safety, as well as physicians' responses to a national
survey.

Altru was recognized as one of 247 hospitals outside major metropolitan areas as
this year's best regional hospitals.

Several other hospitals in the region also made the list, including Sanford USD
Medical Center in Sioux Falls, S.D., and Sanford Fargo Medical Center in Fargo.

Altru also announced Friday that it was the only health care system in North
Dakota to be named to the 2012 IMS Top 100 Integrated Healthcare Network list.
The distinction recognizes the nation's top health care networks based on their
performance level and degree of integration.
