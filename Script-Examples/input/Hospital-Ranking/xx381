The latest report on the best hospitals in the U.S. confirms what similar
surveys found: Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore is tops in reputation and
quality.

The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.; UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles;
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; and Duke University Medical Center,
Durham, N.C., round out the top five in the U.S. News & World Report survey
reaching newsstands today.

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York ranked first in cancer care;
Mayo Clinic, tops in heart care.

The National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago compiled
rankings based on a survey of specialist doctors, federal data on hospital death
rates and factors such as ratio of nurses to beds.

Hopkins won the top ranking in the three previous U.S. News surveys and in
another recently done by the authors of The Best Doctors in America
(Woodward/White, $ 95).
