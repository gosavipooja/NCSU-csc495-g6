Emory University Hospital earned top marks in the latest U.S. News & World
Report ranking of America's best hospitals, released Thursday. Emory's
cardiology program ranked seventh in the nation, placing it in the top 10 for
the 13th time since the magazine's "best hospital" rankings began in 1990. Last
year the program was ranked eighth.

"We believe the fact that our U.S. News & World Report ranking has risen a notch
reflects the growing recognition among our medical colleagues across the nation
that Emory provides some of the very best cardiology care available anywhere,"
said Dr. Douglas Morris, director of the Emory Heart Center.

Six other Emory programs rank among the nation's top 50 in their respective
areas: eyes (15), geriatrics (41), gynecology (39), kidney disease (28),
psychiatry (17) and urology (32). Emory was the only hospital in Georgia to make
the top 50 in any of these specialty areas.

Shepherd Center in Atlanta ranked 16th for rehabilitation, and Hughston Sports
Medicine Hospital in Columbus ranked 24th for rheumatology.

The U.S. News rankings are based on the hospitals' professional reputation,
patient mortality, and a host of other factors, including the nurse-to-patient
ratio and access to advanced medical technology.
