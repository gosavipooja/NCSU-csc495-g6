Jan. 30--Gundersen Lutheran has received the Health-Grades' 2009 Distin-guished
Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence based on clinical quality performance for
the second straight year.

The ranking places Gundersen Lutheran among the nation's top 5 percent of
hospitals. This year only 270 of the nation's nearly 5,000 non-federal hospitals
will receive the award.

The rankings are based on an independent study of mortality and complication
rates for nearly 5,000 hospitals released by HealthGrades, a national health
care ratings company.

According to the HealthGrades study, patients admitted to a hospital receiving
this award are, on average, 27 percent less likely to die and 8 percent less
likely to suffer from a major complication.

Gundersen Lutheran also achieved several other HealthGrades quality
designations, including excellence awards for critical care, joint replacement,
pulmonary care, general surgery, bariatric surgery and treatment of heart attack
and heart failure.
