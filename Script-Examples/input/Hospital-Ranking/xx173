TAMPA - H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute and Tampa General
Hospital were named to top 50 specialty rankings released Thursday by U.S. News
& World Report.

Moffitt was 16th in the nation and first in Florida for cancer hospitals in the
20th annual "America's Best Hospitals" rankings conducted by the national
magazine. It was the 11th consecutive year the Tampa hospital made the list.

Tampa General placed in the top 50 in seven medical specialties: diabetes and
endocrine disorders (32); geriatric care (47); gynecology (22); heart and heart
surgery (34), kidney disorders (37), orthopedics (27); and urology (29).

No Bay area hospital made the magazine's honor roll of 21 hospitals ranking near
the top in at least six of the 16 specialties graded.

The ranking of 4,861 American hospitals was determined through a combination of
objective and subjective measures, making the results the source of some debate.

Objective data include safety reports and mortality statistics from Medicare
recipients. A subjective "reputation" calculation determined one-third of a
hospital's score. As in previous years, it was compiled by surveying a random
sample of 200 specialty physicians asked to list five hospitals they consider
the best in their area of expertise.

hospitals.
