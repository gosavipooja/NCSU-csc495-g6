Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City has been ranked number 18 on
a list of the nation's best children's hospitals compiled by U.S. News and World
Report.

It received a top ranking for having a low death rate in three complex
procedures.

The magazine analyzed surgeries to repair a heart defect, remove a cancerous
brain tumor and transplant bone marrow. A hospital could receive up to 6 points,
depending on the number of procedures it completed and its death rate.

Primary Children's was the only children's hospital to receive the full six
points, it said in a statement Friday.

"This recognition . . . confirms something that we've known for years - that we
have one of the best children's hospitals in the country," said Joe Mott, chief
executive officer. "But we are most proud of our top ranking in lowest mortality
rates."

There were 122 U.S. children's hospitals that met the magazine's definition; 113
responded to its surveys and 30 were highlighted as top facilities.

The magazine's analysis of children's hospitals was expanded this year -
rankings were based on reputation, death rate, and care-related factors such as
the number of patients, the number of nurses and types of care available.

The hospital's ranking confirms the "high quality of care delivered at Primary
Children's," said physician Edward Clark, its medical director. He added, "We
are focused on 'the child first and always' and driven to provide the best
medical care available for children and their families."
