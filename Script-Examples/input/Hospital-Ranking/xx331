Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital has been ranked in five specialties in
U.S. News & World Report's 2013-14 Best Children's Hospitals rankings, according
to a hospital news release.

Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital ranked in cancer, urology, orthopedics,
neurology and neurosurgery, and cardiology and heart surgery - two more
specialties than last year. Children's Hospital first made the Best Children's
Hospitals list in 2008. The new Best Children's Hospitals list is the first to
be released since Penn State Hershey opened its new 263,000-square-foot
Children's Hospital building in February.

The rankings highlight the top 50 U.S. hospitals in each of these pediatric
specialties: cancer, cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and endocrinology,
gastroenterology, neonatology, nephrology, neurology and neurosurgery,
orthopedics, pulmonology, and urology. Eighty-seven hospitals across the country
ranked in one or more specialties.
