Jul. 7--U.S. News & World Report has ranked Mayo Clinic second overall to Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore in its 2006 edition of America's Best Hospitals,
which is available Monday.

Now in its 17th year, America's Best Hospitals screens more than 5,189 hospitals
and medical centers. It ranks 176 of them in 16 specialties.

"Choosing the right hospital is critical," said Brian Duffy, editor of U.S. News
& World Report. "U.S. News' annual hospital guide provides consumers with a
comprehensive assessment to choose the best hospital specific to their needs.
Although this year's Honor Roll is an elite group, hospitals around the country
are excelling in a variety of fields."

Of the 176 medical centers that are ranked in this year's edition of America's
Best Hospitals, 14 earned Honor Roll status by ranking at or near the top in at
least six specialties, a demonstration of unusually broad expertise.

The top five are, in order, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore; Mayo Clinic in
Rochester; Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland; Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston; and UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.

The rankings weigh three elements equally: reputation, death rate and such
care-related factors as nursing and patient services.

The guide also covers the topic of when patients should go to highly regarded
hospitals.
