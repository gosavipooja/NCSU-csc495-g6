Top ranking

Harrington HealthCare System's emergency departments in both Southbridge and
Webster rank among the top 49 healthcare systems in the country, or the top 2
percent, for short waiting times, according to statistics compiled by Becker's
Hospital Review.

The average wait in the emergency departments at Harrington Hospital and
Harrington HealthCare at Hubbard in Webster was 6 minutes for the first quarter
of 2012.

Becker's compiled the data from information that Harrington provides each
quarter to the national Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The time
represents the average time patients spent in the emergency departments before
they were seen by a health care provider. CMMS examines the emergency department
waiting times in more than 3,500 hospitals nationwide.

Harrington publishes the waiting times in both emergency departments on its
website, harringtonhospital.org.
