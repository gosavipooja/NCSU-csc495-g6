U.S. News & World Report has recognized Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey
Medical Center as one of the best hospitals for 2016-17 in ear, nose and throat
care.

The medical center was also recognized as "high performing" in seven additional
treatment areas: cancer, gastroenterology and GI surgery, nephrology, neurology
and neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

The U.S. News Best Hospitals rankings, now in their 27th year, help guide
patients to hospitals that deliver outstanding care across 25 specialties,
procedures and conditions. The Best Hospitals methodologies include objective
measures such as patient survival, the number of times a given procedure is
performed, infection rates, adequacy of nurse staffing and more.

For 2016-17, 153 hospitals were ranked in at least one specialty, while 1,628
received a high performing rating in one or more specialties, procedures or
conditions. In rankings by state and metro area, U.S. News recognized hospitals
that were high-performing across multiple areas of care.

The rankings are published in the U.S. News "Best Hospitals 2017" guidebook. For
