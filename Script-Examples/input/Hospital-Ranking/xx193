The U.S. News & World Report's 23rd annual Best Hospitals -rankings showcase 732
of the nation's 4,800 hospitals.

Of those, 148 were nationally ranked in at least one of 16 specialties.
Hospitals that didn't make that cut but were rated in the top 25% for at least
one speciality were eligible for a regional ranking.

Factors used by U.S. News to compile the rankings include survival rates, safety
measures, nurse-to-patient ratios, other data and surveys of specialists around
the country.

"Each year, we refine the methodology we use to rank hospitals to reflect the
latest knowledge about the best recipes for top-notch care," said Ben Harder,
general manager of the magazine's health rankings.

"In several specialties, for example, we gave more weight this year to the
number of difficult cases each hospital handles, because evidence shows lots of
practice generally makes a hospital that much closer to perfect.

"On the flip side, we relied a little less this year on hospitals' reputations
among medical specialists."
