Health Insight has ranked Wesley Medical Center number one among hospitals in
Mississippi in Quality Measures for 2008.

Health Insight calculates national rankings for hospitals using publicly
reported data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital
Compare web site. The Hospital Compare data contains hospital-specific
performance on 25 quality measures for over 4,200 hospitals nationwide. The
quality measures show how often hospitals give recommended treatments that are
known to get the best results for patients.

The Quality Measures used to compute the rankings are drawn from four clinical
topic areas: heart attack; heart failure; pneumonia; and, surgical infection
prevention. Information about these treatments is taken from the patients'
record. Hospitals voluntarily report their data, and some hospitals may not
provide data for some topics or measures.

Not only was Wesley Medical Center ranked first in Mississippi, the hospital
also ranks in the 93rd percentile nationally, which means that in quality
measures, Wesley ranks better than all other hospitals in the nation below the
93 percent level.
