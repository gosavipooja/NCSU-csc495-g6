Sarasota Memorial Hospital is among the nation's best in a ranking by U.S. News
and World Report magazine.

The 828-bed facility was ranked among the top 50 hospitals in seven different
medical specialties.

"It puts us at the top of the list for community hospitals," said Dr. Bruce
Fleegler, Sarasota Memorial's chief medical officer.

The annual list appears in this week's issue of U.S. News.

Hospital officials credited SMH's doctors, nurses and staff for the high
rankings.

The magazine looked at 17 specialties at 6,007 medical centers across the
country. The rankings are based on a hospital's reputation, mortality rate and
care-related factors such as nursing and patient services.

The listings include the 50 highest scoring hospitals in each specialty.

Sarasota Memorial was ranked for its performance in the following specialties:
cancer; digestive disorders; ear, nose and throat; geriatrics; heart and heart
surgery; orthopedics; and urology.

Patients pay attention to the rankings, said Jan Mauck, the hospital's chief
nursing officer, especially those from outside the area looking for specialty
care.

Other Florida hospitals making the list: Tampa General Hospital, the Bascom
Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Hospital in Orlando, the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in
Tampa and St. Vincent's Medical Center in Jacksonville.
