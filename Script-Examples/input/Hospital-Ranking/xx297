The Mayo Clinic in Rochester was once again ranked second in the U.S. News &
World Report honor roll of the nation's best hospitals.

The perennial magazine ranking, one of several attempts to name the best through
measures of reputation, mortality, staffing and other factors, identified 14
hospitals on the honor roll that ranked high in at least six specialities. Johns
Hopkins in Baltimore topped the list.

Mayo was named the top hospital for orthopedics, neurology and neurosurgery,
endocrinology and digestive disorders.

The world-renown institution also came in second or third for gynecology,
cardiology and heart surgery, kidney disease, respiratory disorders, urology and
rheumatology.

In addition to its clinic and outpatient facilities, Mayo's Rochester
organization includes Methodist and Saint Marys hospitals.

The University of Minnesota Medical Center was named among the best 50 hospitals
in 11 specialities, with its highest placement at 19th for kidney disease.

Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis was noted in four specialities;
Abbott Northwestern in Minneapolis was named in three and St. Cloud Hospital was
noted in two specialties.

The magazine said it developed its rankings by screening 5,189 hospitals, with
176 hospitals earning mention for at least one of the 16 specialties.
