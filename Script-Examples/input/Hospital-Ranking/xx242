Utah: What the Best Hospitals Rankings Are -- and Aren't

LENGTH: 141  words

DATELINE: Salt Lake City


Illinois Hospital Association, The State of Utah has issued the following news
release:

What the Best Hospitals Rankings Are -- and Aren't
The new round of Best Hospitals 2013-14 rankings, published online July 16,
stirred up more than the usual intensity of the expected annual scrutiny. A July
25 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal was especially sharp. Ezekiel
Emanuel, chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the
University of Pennsylvania, questioned the validity of the rankings, and in a
follow-up commentary July 29 on MSNBC's Morning Joe he called the rankings
"pretty worthless." We obviously disagree. Here, then, are the major points
raised in the Wall Street Journal and echoed elsewhere, other frequently voiced
concerns, and our responses.
