SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. A-9

LENGTH: 187 words


U.S. News and World Report's annual best hospitals list includes The University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center as one of the nation's 17 "honor roll" hospitals
for its ranking near the top in six or more specialty areas, the 12th time UPMC
has made the list.

The rankings, released today, listed UPMC 12th nationally, one slot higher than
last year and ahead of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle.
UPMC is the only Western Pennsylvania hospital to make the honor roll.

Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore received the top ranking nationally,
followed by Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston; Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn.; and Cleveland Clinic. University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia was
ranked 10th.

The rankings are based on factors such as death rates, patient safety and number
of procedures, as well as responses to a national survey of physicians who were
asked to name the best hospital in their specialty for the toughest cases.

UPMC's highest ranking in an individual specialty was second, for ear, nose and
throat.
