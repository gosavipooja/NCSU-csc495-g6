For the sixth consecutive year, Penn State Children's Hospital has been ranked
among the Best Children's Hospitals in multiple specialties by U.S. News & World
Report.

Penn State Children's Hospital ranked in cancer, neonatology, neurology and
neurosurgery, orthopedics and urology in the 2016-2017 rankings. This marks the
first time the Children's Hospital has been ranked in neonatology, singling out
the care provided by the region's highest level neonatal intensive care unit.

"The recognition of our neonatology program is a testament to the high quality
care we provide to our hospital's most fragile newborn patients," said Dr.
Barbara Ostrov, interim chair of pediatrics at Penn State Children's Hospital,
in a news release.

The U.S. News rankings highlight the top 50 U.S. hospitals in each of 10
pediatric specialties: cancer, cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and
endocrinology, gastroenterology, neonatology, nephrology, neurology and
neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

Penn State Children's Hospital is located in Derry Township.
