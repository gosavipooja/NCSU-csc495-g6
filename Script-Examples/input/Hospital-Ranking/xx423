LENGTH: 118  words


New Delhi, July 19 -- Cedars-Sinai has been named to the Honor Roll in the
2013-14 issue of America's Best Hospitals by U.S. News & World Report, with 12
of the medical center's specialties rated among the finest in the nation.



Out of nearly 5,000 hospitals surveyed for the annual rankings, Cedars-Sinai is
among just 18 hospitals nationwide to earn the magazine's Honor Roll
designation. To be named to the Honor Roll, a hospital must be rated among the
nation's top 50 programs in at least six specialties.

Cedars-Sinai also is in the elite group of hospitals that had more than 10
specialties among the top 50 nationally. Just 3 percent of the nation's
hospitals earned a national ranking in a single specialty.
