London's Lawson Health research institute has been ranked, again, among Canada's
top research hospitals.

The research institute of St. Joseph's Health Care London and London Health
Sciences Centre, Lawson placed eighth in the Top 40 list released Thursday.

Factors included in the ranking include total research income from the previous
year.

Last year, Lawson received about $115 million in research income, up2.2 per cent
from the previous budget year.

The ranking is done annually by research infosource inc., a Toronto-based
clearing house on research and development information.

Lawson also placed eighth on the list last year.

Lawson is one of two major medical research institutes in London. The other,
opened in 1986, is Robarts research institute at Western University. dr. David
Hill, Lawson's scientific director, said in a statement the results show Lawson
is up there with some of Canada's largest and most successful research
hospitals.

" Despite increased competition for research dollars, the ranking tells us that
Lawson and our two partner hospitals continue to be a major part of Canada's
academic hospital-based research ," he said.
