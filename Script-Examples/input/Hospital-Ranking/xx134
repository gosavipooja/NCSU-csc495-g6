UPMC has been ranked 13th in the U.S. News and World Report's annual listing of
best hospitals for 2015-2016, marking the health system's 16th appearance on the
magazine's honor roll of best hospitals. UPMC was ranked 12th last year.

The list, released Tuesday, cites UPMC's top 10 ranking in six medical
specialties: ear, nose and throat; gastroenterology and GI surgery; orthopedics;
gynecology (Magee-Womens Hospital); psychiatry; and rheumatology.

Massachusetts General topped the list of best hospitals overall, followed by the
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. The only other Pennsylvania hospital on the honor list
was the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, ranked ninth. The Cleveland
Clinic was ranked fifth overall.

U.S. News also listed best hospitals by region, with UPMC leading the local
rankings followed by West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield and Allegheny General
Hospital in the North Side, both part of the Allegheny Health Network.

U.S. News last month ranked Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC the
eighth-best pediatric hospital nationally.

In compiling the rankings, the magazine looks at 16 specialties, 12 of them
based on patient outcomes and other data and four based on physician survey
responses.
