Hallmark Healthcare may have finished No. 23 in the Georgia 100 ranking, but
it's No. 1 with Houston-based Community Health Systems.

Last week the two hospital companies announced a deal in which Community Health
Systems would exchange common stock for the common and preferred shares of
Hallmark Healthcare. The company that would result from the merged firms will
keep the Community Health Systems name and be based in Houston.

On the day the deal was announced, Hallmark Healthcare stock jumped $ 6.75 to $
20.
