POMONA - Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center has been ranked in the top 5
percent of the nation's hospitals for patient satisfaction.

"We take pride in the care we provide our patients, and we are encouraged that
the past experiences of our patients at PVHMC are such that they have rated us
so highly," said Richard Yochum, medical center president, in a news release.
"We intend to continue to provide this level of patient care, or better, in the
years to come."

The ranking was by HealthGrades of Golden, Colo., which rates various
health-care organizations and makes its findings available to consumers.

HealthGrades compiled information from standardized surveys completed by
patients to compile the rankings, which were released Monday.

The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey
contains questions related to a patient's hospital experience.

HealthGrades reviewed 2007 survey data f from 2,591 U.S. hospitals, said Scott
Shapiro, HealthGrades spokesman.

Previously, HealthGrades has given high marks to the hospital inpatient
outcomes.

"For a hospital to meet that threshold and now be in the top 5 percent (of
hospitals in patient satisfaction) speaks to both parts of quality," Shapiro
said.
