LENGTH: 138 words


WEXFORD General Hospital was among seven hospitals across the country to receive
a favourable 'green' ranking in the latest results published by 'Healthstat'.

Each hospital is judged over three categories: Access, Integration and
Resources. Wexford General received a 'green' ranking in Access, which measures
the waiting times that people experience for different services.

Wexford also received a 'green' ranking in Integration, which ensures that
patients are receiving outpatient or day care when they should be, that, where
suitable, people are being admitted on the day of their procedure and that the
length of their stay is as expected.

Wexford General received an ' amber' ranking, meaning average performance, in
Resources. Resources judges whether a hospital is making the best use of its
human and financial resources.
