Four New York-area hospitals are among the top 30 children's hospitals listed by
U.S. News and World Report in a ranking that is to be published Friday.

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the
Children's Hospital at Montefiore, and Schneider Children's Hospital on Long
Island were among the nation's top children's hospitals, according to the
ranking, which appears in the magazine's June 9 issue. The ranking weighed each
hospital's reputation, clinical outcomes, and other measures such as nursing
care and technology. Nationwide, 113 hospitals were ranked in seven categories,
including general pediatrics; heart and heart surgery; neonatal care; cancer;
digestive disorders; neurology and neurosurgery, and respiratory diseases.

Among the New York hospitals, the highest ranking on any list was achieved by
the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, which ranked
fourth in neonatal care. "We are making major moves in the pediatric area," the
hospital's president and CEO, Dr. Herbert Pardes, said.
