UPMC earned a spot on the honor roll of the annual U.S. News & World Report
rankings of the nation's best hospitals.

UPMC ranked 12th overall, up from last year's 13th place. UPMC was  one of 17
hospital systems that made the magazine's annual honor roll.  UPMC also placed
in the top ten in nine medical specialties: Ear, nose  and throat, respiratory
disorders, gynecology, orthopedics, psychiatry,  geriatric care, neurology and
neurosurgery, rheumatology and digestive  disorders.

The Honor Roll lists facilities that demonstrate excellence and  breadth of
expertise by ranking at or near the top in at least six  specialties. The Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore earned the top spot  among about 5,000 hospitals
in the United States for the 22nd year,  according to U.S. News and World
Report's 2011-2012 rankings.

The 2011 rankings also ranked Allegheny General Hospital in  Pittsburgh's North
Side among the top 50 centers in the nation for  quality care in the fields of
cardiology and heart surgery,  gastroenterology and orthopedics.

Allegheny General and several of its sister hospitals -- Forbes  Regional
Hospital in Monroeville, Allegheny Valley Hospital in Natrona  Heights and West
Penn Hospital in Bloomfield -- were recognized in  regional rankings for high
achievement in several of the 16 specialty  areas analyzed by the magazine.
