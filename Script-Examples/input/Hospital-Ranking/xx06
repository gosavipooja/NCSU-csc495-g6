Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center ranked nationally in several
adult and pediatric specialties, and was listed as "high performing" in eight of
the nine types of common procedures and conditions analyzed in U.S. News & World
Report's annual best hospitals analysis, released Tuesday.

Lancaster General Hospital (LGH), meanwhile, is one of only 48 across America to
earn the high ranking designation in all nine categories.

The nine categories

As part of its Best Hospitals rankings and ratings, U.S. News evaluated more
than 4,500 hospitals for their handling of nine surgical procedures and chronic
conditions: Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aortic valve surgery, heart bypass
surgery, heart failure, colon cancer surgery, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), hip replacement, knee replacement and lung cancer surgery.

More than 1,200 hospitals earned a rating of high performing in at least one
procedure or condition. Only 48 received that top rating in all nine areas.
Lancaster General Hospital was the only midstate facility to do so. In
Pennsylvania, Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown also made the cut, as did
Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals in Philadelphia.

U.S. News evaluated data on nearly 5,000 hospitals in 16 adult specialties, nine
adult procedures and conditions and 10 pediatric specialties.

Pennsylvania has nearly 250 hospitals, U.S. News & World Report's annual best
hospitals analysis "meet high U.S. News standards and are ranked in the state,"
the magazine said. Of those, four are in Central Pennsylvania: Hershey Med, LGH,
PinnacleHealth hospitals and WellSpan York Hospital.

Below is a summary of what the report had to say about each of those facilities.

bypass surgery, heart failure, colon cancer surgery, COPD, knee replacement and

health affairs for Penn State. "Moving forward, we must continue to take steps
