DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG


A national parenting magazine has named All Children's Hospital one of the
nation's top 25  medical centers for pediatric care, and one of the two best in
Florida.

All Children's in St. Petersburg and Wolfson Children's Hospital in Jacksonville
tied for 16th place in Child magazine's annual ranking.

They were the only Florida hospitals on the list. All Children's was ranked 16th
last year as well.

The rankings were based on information from the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the National Association of
Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, the magazine and hospital said.

Hospitals also completed surveys on survival rates, staff qualifications, safety
and other criteria.

Nationally, 100 hospitals were considered for the  25 spots. The issue hits
newsstands next Tuesday. The leading children's hospital was the Children's
Hospital of Pennsylvania. A complete list can be found on the magazine's Web
site,  http://www.child.com.
