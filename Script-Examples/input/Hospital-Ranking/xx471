Children's hospital rankings updated

U.S. News and World Report recalculated some of its latest rankings of top
children's hospitals. UW Hospital's American Family Children's Hospital is 27th
in pulmonology, 28th in neonatology, 32nd in gastroenterology and 33rd in
cancer. Those rankings are slightly different from the ones U.S. News initially
released, as reported in a brief item on the front page of the Business section
June 6.

The Wisconsin State Journal strives to be accurate and fair. If you find an
error or other problem, please call the appropriate reporter at 608-252-6100;
the section editor; or Teryl Franklin, the managing editor, at 608-252-6117.
