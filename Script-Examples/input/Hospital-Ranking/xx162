National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: National Hospital Ranking
Again Recognizes U-M Health System for Broad-based Excellence in Adult Care

LENGTH: 212  words


July 15 -- The annual survey of American hospitals puts U-M in the national top
tier in 15 different medical specialties, for treating patients with everything
from joint disorders, cancer and eye conditions to heart disease, kidney failure
and ear, nose and throat complaints.

This year, only 144 of the thousands of hospitals across the country earned even
one ranked spot on the U.S. News lists of Best Hospitals. But UMHS earned that
distinction in eight specialties.

In another seven, U-M's care was recognized as among the nation's finest.
What's more, this is the 22nd year in a row that UMHS has been recognized for
strong across-the-board performance on a national level.

The new rankings for adult care follow on the heels of the Best Children's
Hospitals ratings issued last month. In those, U-M's C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital achieved top-tier national rankings in all 10 pediatric specialties
that U.S. News rates.    Even as the new rankings come out, UMHS leaders are
parsing the data behind them, as part of continuous efforts to find ways to
improve patient safety and clinical quality.

In recent years, hard-data measures such as these have driven great change in
American health care - and UMHS has harnessed them in a never-ending quest for
improvement.
