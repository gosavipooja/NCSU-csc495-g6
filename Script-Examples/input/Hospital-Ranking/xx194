UW Hospital and Clinics is the top-rated hospital in the state once again,
according to rankings released by U.S. News & World Report in its annual Best
Hospitals guide.

This is the sixth year in a row UW Hospital and Clinics has been named the
state's top hospital.

The nation's 4,500 hospitals were evaluated in 16 specialties, with only 152
hospitals getting at least one ranking in a specialty. UW Hospital is ranked in
nine specialties.

The highest rankings attained by UW Hospital were in gynecology at 13 and
urology at 16.

The hospital also scored high in nephrology (28), pulmonology (28), geriatrics
(31), cancer (37), gastroenterology and GI surgery (37), neurology and
neurosurgery (43) and orthopedics (45).

Data used by U.S. News mostly came from the American Hospital Association Annual
Survey Database, which measures advanced technology, patient volume, nursing
intensity and the presence of a high-level trauma center, UW Health said.

Mayo Clinic was named the best hospital in the country for the second straight
year, followed by the Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital.
