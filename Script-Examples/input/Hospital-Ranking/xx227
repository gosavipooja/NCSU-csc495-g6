SECTION: Pg. B-4

LENGTH: 254 words


Wolfson Children's Hospital in Jacksonville is among the top 50 hospitals in six
of 10 pediatric specialties as rated by U.S. News & World Report in its
2012-2013 Best Children's Hospitals.

In pediatric categories, the hospital, part of Baptist Health, was ranked 25th
in urology; 33rd in pulmonology; 38th in neurology and neurosurgery; 39th in
diabetes and endocrinology; 40th in cardiology and heart surgery; and 49th in
cancer care.

Other categories ranked in the magazine's report were neonatology, nephrology,
orthopedics and gastroenterology.

Shands Hospital for Children at the University of Florida in Gainesville also
made the list, ranking in the top 50 in seven specialties. It ranked 13th in
diabetes and endocrinology; 24th in cardiology and heart surgery; 26th in
gastroenterology; 27th in nephrology; 31st in pulmonology; 33rd in neonatology;
and 49th in neurology and neurosurgery.

U.S. News surveyed 178 pediatric centers to obtain data such as availability of
key resources and ability to prevent complications and infections. The hospital
survey made up 75 percent of the rankings. A separate reputational survey in
which 1,500 pediatric specialists - 150 in each specialty - were asked where
they would send the sickest children in their specialty made up the remaining 25
percent.

Eighty hospitals ranked in at least one specialty.

rankings will also be published in the U.S. News Best Hospitals 2013 guidebook,
available in August.
