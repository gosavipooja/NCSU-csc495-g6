UnityPoint on top hospital list

UnityPoint Health-Finley Hospital was ranked as one of the 15 top ranking
hospitals by Consumer Reports patient safety rankings provided by Becker's
Hospital Review.

The rankings, for more than 2,500 hospitals, are based on a composite score
between one and 100 of five quality measures, using data from CMS and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measures include mortality,
admissions, overuse of imaging, healthcare-associated infections and
communication, according to a Medscape report on the rankings.
