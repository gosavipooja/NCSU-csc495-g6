Two northern Colorado hospitals Â­-- Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins and
Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland -- rank among the top 10 hospitals in
Colorado, according to a recent report by U.S. News and World Report.

The rankings of more than 5,000 hospitals are largely based on objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data and nurse staffing levels. The
annual ranking is in its 24th year. Of Colorado's 100 hospitals, PVH was ranked
fourth best and MCR seventh.

Hospitals were given high performing ratings for certain specialties. PVH was
ranked as high performing in diabetes and endocrinology, ear, nose and throat,
geriatrics, gynecology, nephrology, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

Staff reports

MCR was ranked high performing for gastroenterology and GI surgery, geriatrics,
nephrology, orthopedics and urology.

Both PVH and MCR are part of University of Colorado Health, which has five
hospitals and clinics throughout Colorado. The University of Colorado Hospital,
also part of UCHealth, was ranked the top hospital in the state by "U.S. News
and World Report."

North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley was not ranked.
