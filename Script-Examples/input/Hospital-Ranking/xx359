DATELINE: CRYSTAL RIVER


A health care information company once again has counted Seven Rivers Community
Hospital among the nation's top 100 hospitals.

The company, Illinois-based Solucient, bases its rankings on quality of care and
efficiency, among other factors. Data are analyzed in groups based on hospital
size and teaching status.

In 1999 the company, then known as HCIA-Sachs, included Seven Rivers as one of
the top 100 U.S. hospitals. A year later it counted Seven Rivers among the
nation's top 100 hospitals for treating stroke patients.

"I am extremely proud of our continuing accomplishments," said Don McKenna,
chief executive officer of the 128-bed hospital, in prepared remarks. "To think
that we are among the top 100 hospitals when compared to the nearly 6,000 across
the country - it's just a wonderful achievement."
