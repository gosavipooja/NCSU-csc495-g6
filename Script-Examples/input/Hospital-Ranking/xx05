June 09--U.S. News & World Report has named Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
the second best pediatric hospital in the nation in its 2015-16 rankings.

CHOP has taken top honors (or tied with another hospital) as the No. 1 pediatric
hospital since 2011, but this year, Boston Children's Hospital beat out CHOP in
the pediatric "honor roll". CHOP is the only pediatric hospital in the tri-state
region named to the prestigious list.

In the 2014 rankings, CHOP tied with Boston Children's Hospital for the No. 1
spot, with a ranking in the top three spots in eight out of 10 specialties.

This year, of the 10 specialties, CHOP ranked first in neonatology and
orthopedics. It scored in second or third place in six other specialties:
cancer, endocrinology, gastroenterology, neurology, pulmonology, and urology.

To conduct the rankings, U.S. News raked through data from 184 pediatric
hospitals and survey results from more than 2,800 pediatric specialists. To make
the best pediatric hospitals honor roll, a hospital had to score near the top of
at least three of 10 medical specialties ranked. Scores were determined by
clinical outcomes, efficiency of care and care-related resources like adequate
nursing staff.
