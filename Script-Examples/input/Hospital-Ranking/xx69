New Delhi, July 19 -- The Mount Sinai Medical Center is prominently featured in
U.S. News & World Report's clinical specialty ranking of the nation's most
outstanding hospitals.



Mount Sinai is nationally ranked as one of the top 25 hospitals in 7 out of 16
specialties and in the top 10 in three of those: Geriatrics (#4),
Gastroenterology (GI) and GI Surgery (#9) and Ear, Nose & Throat (#10). Mount
Sinai was high-performing in Gynecology, Cancer, Urology, Psychiatry,
Orthopaedics, and Pulmonology.

Mount Sinai also ranked among the best hospitals in the New York region.
Covering 94 metro areas in the United States, the regional hospital rankings
complement the national rankings by including hospitals with solid performance
in one or more of the 16 specialties in the Best Hospitals list.

The 2013-2014 edition of "Best Hospitals" can be found online at
www.usnews.com/besthospitals and will be on newsstands Monday, August 26.

This year's Best Hospitals showcases more than 720 of the nation's roughly 5,000
hospitals. In arriving at its rankings for 12 specialties, U.S. News & World
Report evaluated each institution's reputation, mortality index, patient safety
record, discharges, and other care-related factors, including nursing and
technology. The rankings for four specialties, Ophthalmology, Psychiatry,
Rehabilitation, and Rheumatology were based on reputation alone, and reflect a
three-year running average.
