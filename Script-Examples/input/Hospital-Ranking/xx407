NEW YORK-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell is once again
tops among New York City area hospitals, according to U.S. News & World Report.

It is the 11th year in a row that the hospital took top honors in the metro area
in the magazine's popular Best Hospitals rankings.

"We're really happy, and this is an indication of our commitment to quality and
excellence," said Dr. Steven Corwin, executive vice president and chief
operating officer for the hospital. "It's not about the rankings. It's about
saving and taking care of people."

Just 17 hospitals made the national Honor Roll, the magazine said. Overall, U.S.
News & World Report staff ranked Johns Hopkins No. 1, followed by Massachusetts
General Hospital at No. 2 and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota at No. 3.

Four adult facilities and one pediatric center compose the New York-Presbyterian
University Hospital umbrella.
