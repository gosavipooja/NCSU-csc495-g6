Magazine ranks New Hanover Regional among best hospitals in the country

Wilmington | New Hanover Regional Medical Center has received national
recognition in U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings of best hospitals.

NHRMC was recognized among the best hospitals in North Carolina and the Coastal
Plain area, sharing the No. 15 spot with Duke Raleigh Hospital in Raleigh,
Gaston Memorial Hospital in Gastonia, Presbyterian Hospital-Matthews in Matthews
and Southeastern Regional Medical Center in Lumberton.

NHRMC was also recognized as high-performing in cardiology and heart surgery,
gastroenterology, orthopedics and pulmonology.

The rankings showcase approximately 720 of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals,
and judge medical centers on their competence in situations in which patients
are especially at risk because of age, physical condition, infirmities, or the
challenging nature of the surgery or other care they need.
