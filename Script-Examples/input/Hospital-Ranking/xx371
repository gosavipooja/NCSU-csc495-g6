Staff lift rates of satisfaction

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 186 words


AN overcrowded emergency department and lengthening elective surgery waiting
lists are believed to be among the reasons why the public satisfaction rate with
the Albury hospital ranks the second lowest among hospitals of a similar size.

Albury received a score of 74.2 out of 100 in an annual report recording the
experiences of public patients.

Albury Wodonga Health chief Dr Stuart Spring believes the result in the "good to
very good" category has been achieved in spite of the problems experienced by
the health service.

He credits the work of medical staff at the hospital in helping the hospital to
its ranking.

There is good news for other public hospitals in the region with Wodonga scoring
79.3, while Northeast Health Wangaratta's score of 82 placed them in the "very
good to excellent" category, ranking them among the leaders across Victoria.

The value of quality staff and the provision of care to patients coupled with
respect has been highlighted in the good results achieved by the region's
leading hospitals.

Attention to issues at Albury will go a long way to lifting its satisfaction
ranking in the future.
