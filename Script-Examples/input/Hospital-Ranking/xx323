In the contest for best Utah hospital, first place is a crowded spot. The two
titans are tied.

Intermountain Medical Center and University of Utah Hospital both lead the pack
of nearly 60 hospitals statewide, according to U.S. News & World Report's
2015-2016 "Best Hospitals" rankings, released this week.

There are multiple runners-up, too.

The No. 3 slot is shared by Ogden's Intermountain McKay-Dee Hospital, Salt Lake
City's LDS Hospital and Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo.

Both of the overall first-place centers celebrated the news.

"This recognition is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our staff
and physicians," said Vivian Lee, CEO of U. Health Care, in a prepared
statement, "and it's gratifying to be ranked among the nation's best."

The U. system has 527 hospital beds, about 1,300 physicians and 11 community
clinics along the Wasatch Front.

Intermountain Medical Center also praised its own "incredible team of
physicians, staff, volunteers and others who are passionate about delivering the
highest quality health care possible and who strive for excellence day in and
day out," said CEO David Grauer in a news release. "We are honored that their
great work is being recognized."

About 5,000 hospitals in 94 U.S. metro areas qualified for this year's rankings.

To do so, they had to offer each of 16 required medical specialties.

The rankings were based on death rates, patient safety rates, procedure volumes
and other criteria.
