Lucile Packard Children's Hospital was ranked one of the nation's best
children's hospitals in the latest U.S. News & World Report released Thursday.

The hospital was ranked fifth in the nation for treatment of kidney disorders
and for heart surgery. It was also ranked sixth for neonatology, or the care of
newborn infants.

Lucile Packard officials said no other Bay Area children's hospital had programs
ranked in the top 10.

The rankings were based on surveys from 96 children's hospitals, and considered
their reputation, medical outcomes such as cancer survival rates, and other
factors such as nurse staffing and availability of specialized programs.

"We share this success with our entire faculty and staff," Christopher Dawes,
president and CEO at Lucile Packard, said in a statement. "They're pioneers in
pediatric and obstetric medicine, and it's through their passion and innovation
that we have built one of the nation's best children's hospital."

Last year, Stanford Hospital & Clinics ranked well in U.S. News & World Report's
rankings of non-children's hospitals. Of about 4,800 hospitals in 2009, Stanford
ranked 10th for cancer treatment and 14th for rheumatology, gynecology, and ear,
nose and throat treatment.
