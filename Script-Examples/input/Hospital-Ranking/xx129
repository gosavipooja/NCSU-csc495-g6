Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield and Northwestern
Medicine Lake Forest Hospital were among three Northwestern Medicine hospitals
that were recognized by U.S. News & World Report in its 2015-2016 ranking of
America's Best Hospitals.

Central DuPage Hospital is ranked 6th in both Illinois and the Chicago metro
region by the magazine. Lake Forest Hospital is ranked 19th in Illinois and 16th
in the Chicago metro region, by the magazine's Best Hospitals Honor Roll.
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago was listed for the fourth consecutive
year, ranking 11th in the nation and 1st in Illinois.

The Best Hospitals Honor Roll highlights 15 hospitals out of nearly 5,000
nationwide for their expertise in treating the most challenging patients in at
least six medical specialties. Northwestern Memorial is nationally ranked in 13
out of 16 specialties, with top 10 recognition in six specialties.

Central DuPage Hospital's orthopaedics program was once again recognized
nationally, ranking 36th in the country. Less than 3 percent of the hospitals
evaluated by U.S. News were ranked in even one specialty.

"We strive for excellence in all that we do and these rankings reflect our drive
as a growing health system to be among the best in the nation," said Dean M.
Harrison, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare's president and CEO. "We applaud the
talented physicians, nurses and staff who have earned this recognition. Their
exceptional efforts to provide the very best in high-quality patient care
supports our mission to always put our Patients First."
