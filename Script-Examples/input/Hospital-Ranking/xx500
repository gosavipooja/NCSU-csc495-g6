DATELINE: BAYONET POINT


Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point has been named the nation's 27th best
hospital for heart care and heart surgery, according to Â U.S. News & World
Report.

This is the second time the 290-bed hospital has been in the top 50 of the
magazine's annual rankings. In 1999, the hospital ranked 50th on the list for
heart care and heart surgery.

"We were pleased to get on the ranking again and pleased to see that we moved
significantly up the list," said Bob Conroy, the chief operating officer of the
hospital, which is owned by HCA - The Healthcare Co.

Since its last ranking in U.S. News, Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point has
completed a $39-million expansion, which included the addition of a three-story
cardiac care tower, an upgrade of the center's technology and a consolidation of
the cardiac services into one area of the hospital.

The magazine named 205 hospitals from all over the nation in 17 specialties.

The list is due to appear in its July 22 issue, which will be on the newsstands
Monday.

The hospitals' scores were based on reputation; the ratio of full-time, on-staff
registered nurses to beds; the number of key technologies offered and other
criteria.

Conroy said the hospital was already working on incorporating the award into its
marketing program.

"I think that people look at it, because it's a third-party unbiased
assessment," he said.

"It's just recognition of the hard work done by the staff and the physicians for
taking care of the cardiology patients."
