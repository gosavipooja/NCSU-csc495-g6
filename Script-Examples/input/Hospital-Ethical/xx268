THE General Medical Council has launched a series of online tutorials which
tackle tricky ethical scenarios.

The tutorials include child protection, whistle-blowing and addiction and will
be added to the case load already featured on the GMC's interactive learning
website.

Jane O'Brien, assistant director standards and fitness to practise, said: "The
new scenarios featured on GMP in Action will be happening right now in surgeries
and hospitals across the UK.

"There are rarely black and white answers to a medical ethical dilemma and so
GMP in Action allows the doctor to explore the issue from different viewpoints
and see how certain courses of action can have varying consequences.

"We want to build on the tremendous success of GMP in Action by adding scenarios
that tackle real dilemmas that doctors face."
