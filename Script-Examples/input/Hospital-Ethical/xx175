Showcase ethical business: Sri Sri Ravi Shankar

SECTION: BENGALURU

LENGTH: 254 words


BENGALURU: The Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said it's necessary to
create visible role models of those engaging in ethical business and still
making a profit, thus demonstrating how ethics can become an important
competitive advantage.

"We have seen many dotcoms and Satyams going the unethical way and crashing
down. It has become a lesson to our young people. But it's appalling to see how
smartness got linked to unethical ways of doing business. When I was talking to
young business people, entrepreneurs thought ethics is something na\xEFve. They
felt if you want to be successful, you need to be smart. We need to showcase to
the world those doing ethical business," said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

He was speaking at the Corporate Culture and Spirituality conference organized
by The Art of Living in association with the World Forum for Ethics in Business
in Bengaluru on Saturday.

Ravi Shankar said ethical behaviour makes good business sense. "It's smart to be
ethical and service-oriented. One thing with ethics is you can have a good sleep
and smile from your heart."

Governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, Juan Carlos Losada, youngest member of
Parliament, Columbia, South African high commissioner to India F K Morule,
Daljit Singh, president of Fortis Healthcare, Soumitra Bhattacharya, joint MD of
Bosch India, and other corporate bigwigs participated in the event.

Losada said following ethics in business not only increases profits, but also
weans youth away from violence.
