HUMBOLDT, Sask. (CP) -- A southern Saskatchewan mayor wants the provincial
government to ensure that the Roman Catholic church isn't involved in running a
new hospital being built in his city.

"The message council has received from the community is that there is a clear
desire for a public hospital," said Humboldt Mayor Malcolm Eaton. "In order to
have a hospital that doesn't get into Catholic ethical issues, we need a public
hospital."

Other communities in the area have also expressed support for a publicly
operated hospital instead of a faith-based facility, Eaton said.

Construction is to start on the new hospital this spring.

The current hospital, St. Elizabeth's, serves about 35,000 people in the region
and is owned by the Saskatchewan Catholic Health Corp. The Catholic-run board
receives operating money from the Saskatoon Health Region.

The hospital made the news last year when its board prohibited elective tubal
ligations to prevent pregnancies. That decision sparked ethical debate in and
around Humboldt, about 100 kilometres east of Saskatoon, about faith-based
hospitals.
