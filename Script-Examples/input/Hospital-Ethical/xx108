The Murdoch Institute at the Royal Children's Hospital has become the first
genetic research body in the world to set up an ethics unit to monitor
gene-technology developments.

The head of the unit will be Professor Julian Savulescu, who has worked as a
clinical ethicist at Oxford's Radcliffe hospital in Britain and helped set up an
Oxford ethical institute for health care.

Speaking at the opening of a new ward, the institute's director, Professor Bob
Williamson, said it was crucial that genetic research was carried out with
ethical scrutiny. "If we do not carry out our research and our services
ethically we should not be carrying them out at all," he said.

The institute, which carries out research into birth defects, yesterday opened a
refurbished clinical and research wing. At the opening, Mr Lachlan Murdoch, News
Limited's executive chairman, announced an endowment of $15 million to the
institute.

Professor Savulescu said the ethical unit would ensure new technologies and the
distribution of resources to medical research were ethically justifiable. He
said there was "very little role" for controversial gene cloning techniques when
there were so many other areas that needed funding.
