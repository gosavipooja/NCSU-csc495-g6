Alco-shares are not ethical says trust

AN NHS Trust has pulled more than GBP 7,000 worth of shares out of the drinks
industry after its officials ruled cash earmarked for health care must be
invested more ethically.

Combined Healthcare sold the stocks it held in booze giants Bass, Greenhalls and
Diageo - a company merged from Guinness.

They were among GBP 300,000 investments held by the Trust which runs long -stay
hospitals and community care in North Staffordshire.

The money has built up over the years from donations and wills from the public.

Trusts in other parts of Britain invest some of their charitable funds in
tobacco products and even the armaments industry.

Following the introduction of a new ethical investment policy, Combined
Healthcare screened its share portfolio and found cash sunk in the alcohol
industry - but there were no shares in arms or tobacco companies.

A spokesman for the Bucknall-based trust said: "It was felt as a healthcare
provider, alcohol, tobacco and armaments related industries had to be excluded
from our investments on ethical grounds."

All charitable funds were formally held and invested by health authorities
before the formation of NHS trusts.

In previous years North Staffordshire Health Authority invested cash in alcohol
and even gambling companies.Officials argued they had a responsibility to reap
the highest yields possible on money held on behalf of the public.

And they claimed that alcohol was not harmful to health if taken ion moderation.

But the change of heart has come as an increasing number of hospital beds are
being filled by patients suffering from alcohol related illnesses.
