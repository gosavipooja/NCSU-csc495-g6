Surgeon calls for decision

A SURGEON who was acting director of Townsville Hospital's cardiac unit when it
was shut down for nine months in 2007 still faces allegations of official
misconduct.

Dr Antonio Xabregas has filed a Supreme Court application calling on the Crime
and Misconduct Commission to make a decision on the allegations by next month.

In late 2007, Queensland Health temporarily suspended all services in the
hospital's cardiothoracic unit ``in the interest of public safety'', after
disputes between surgeons.

Although Queensland Health's Ethical Standards Unit has since reviewed more than
5000 documents and conducted many interviews, investigations are continuing into
disputes among the hospital unit's staff.

Dr Xabregas's claim has asked for the CMC, and not the Ethical Standards Unit,
to make a decision over allegations made against him.

However the CMC says it is monitoring the Ethical Standards Unit's
investigations.

Dr Xabregas, the hospital's first cardiothoracic surgeon, remains an employee of
Queensland Health, but it is believed he no longer works at Townsville Hospital.
