Administrator posed an ethical question

SECTION: LETTER; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 231 words


   As a hospital chief executive officer, I have become accustomed these days to
bearing the brunt of criticism for the problems of the health care system.
However, I am somewhat distressed to see two letters to the editor critical of
my comments to your reporter, Lois Sweet, which were quoted in your article,
Health care in crisis. Having read and reread the quote, I have difficulty in
understanding the criticisms raised in these letters.

I at no time associated the issue of increasing patient expectations with that
of putting a price tag on health care costs. In fact, the issue I was raising
was the ethical dilemma we all face as we push the boundaries of what science
and technology may offer us in terms of heroic medical intervention balanced
with the over-all needs of society and the quality of life enjoyed. I have to
admit to being somewhat less than helpful by not offering a solution, but rather
posing the question of how far should the boundary continue to move as one that
needs to be answered.

As the president of a teaching hospital which has a major research focus, I am
committed to advancing knowledge to improve health. However, that does not mean
I believe in pursuing these advances without discussion of the complex, ethical,
moral and fiscal issues they generate.
