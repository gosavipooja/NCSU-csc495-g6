INSURING HOSPITAL CARE: The type of hospital treatment you get may depend on
your insurance, suggests a study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association. The study of 37,994 patients by researchers at Boston's New England
Medical Center showed that privately insured patients are more likely to get
expensive heart treatments than uninsured or Medicaid patients. Privately
insured patients are 80% more likely to have an angiogram, 40% more likely to
undergo bypass surgery and 28% more likely to undergo angioplasty. Findings
''raise the issue of how financial incentives influence the medical
decision-making process,'' Dr. Mark Wenneker says.

 PET CAUSE: Lots of animal-loving celebs will get awards at Saturday's 10th
anniversary gala of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in Washington,
D.C. Among them: Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, k.d. lang, River Phoenix and
ex-Go-Go Jane Wiedlin. But you're probably wondering: What's on the
''cruelty-free'' dinner menu? Melon soup, sauteed potato and corn cake with
vegetables and black beans, potato tart with leeks and tofu, ravioli filled with
ratatouille, carrot and asparagus mousse, salad and rolls. And, for dessert,
tofu ice cream with toppings. Bon appetit.
