Shorvon case holds lessons on talent search

BYLINE: Daniel Koh Kah Soon

LENGTH: 222  words


I REFER to the letter, 'Medical council must respond in Shorvon case' (ST, Sept
6).

Apart from taking the necessary action to clear the misrepresentation made by
Professor Simon Shorvon in The Lancet, as suggested by Mr Joel Luis Da Costa,
the Shorvon case has shown up some important lessons for Singapore in our search
for foreign talent.

Foreign talent should be welcome, but not everyone will do, even if that person
is a top scientist. The talent we employ should be, as far as we have the
instrument to ascertain, people of sound moral character, or at least people who
accept our laws and the ethical standards required for the job.

While many people might have assumed in the past that a place like Britain set
high standards for personal and professional ethics, it seems to me, from the
way the Shorvon case has been managed there, that the British - at least the
people and professional bodies involved - are prepared to accept a lower
standard of ethics to protect the interest of one of their own.

As an ethicist and a voluntary member of an ethics committee in one of our
hospitals, I am glad to say that the ethical standard I find in the local
hospital - which should be reflective of the general standard required of all
hospitals in Singapore, and any developed country - is of a high level which we
can all be proud of.
