Health-care workers offer comfort

I was somewhat surprised by your June 17 article, "Ishtar growing old
profitably," because the Ishtar portrayed there bears little resemblance to the
company the Hospital Employees' Union has come to know.

For example, Arbutus Manor, where your photographer posed a smiling chief
executive officer Samir Manji, is staffed by HEU members who provide the
services that make the residence such a pleasant and comfortable place for
seniors and who contribute significantly to the prosperity Ishtar and its
investors enjoy.

The profitability that Ishtar brags of is conveniently forgotten at the
bargaining table, where our Arbutus members are trying to negotiate a new
contract. The company's recent, final offer included no wage increases over a
four-year contract, no long-term disability plan and an unreasonable termination
clause for casual workers.

In its investment promotion material, Ishtar claims it "offers investors both a
profitable and ethical association with Canada's growing retirement industry."
Ethical implies fairness and that fairness must extend to include the workers.
