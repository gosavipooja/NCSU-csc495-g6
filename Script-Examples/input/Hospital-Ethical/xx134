Re: "Jewish General inoculates its top 200 donors" (Gazette, Nov. 7).

Aaron Derfel's article highlights the delusional state of many
normally-intelligent people when health care is concerned.

Volunteers and committee members give their time to attend those thrilling and
exciting hospital-board meetings. They are present and exposed to the same H1N1
risks in a hospital as many physicians or other health-care workers. It is not
out of line to vaccinate these individuals. It is as ethical or unethical as
physicians bypassing the waiting room or waiting lists to access care or tests
for family members. This is the way it is, unethical or ethical, depending where
you are perched.

Physicians, their extended families and friends, volunteers, the wealthy,
politicians, judges, and donors have been receiving care on a priority basis
unrelated to medical need for years.

Not good, not bad, just the way it is. Kudos to the Jewish General Hospital for
looking after all their employees and volunteers.
