TWO policemen and a woman were in hospital last night after a head-on collision
at Warrandyte.

The Greensborough woman, in her late 20s, suffered chest, head and leg injuries
when her Hyundai Excel and the police car collided about 10pm on the
Research-Warrandyte Rd.

She was flown to the Alfred Hospital and was last night in a serious but stable
condition.

One of the injured officers, a sergeant from Eltham police station, was taken to
Box Hill Hospital with serious chest injuries.

The other officer, an Eltham senior constable, was taken to Maroondah Hospital.
