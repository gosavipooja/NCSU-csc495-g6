Abortion claims panned

CATHOLIC-run hospitals will not close maternity or emergency services if the
Government's abortion Bill is passed, Acting Premier Rob Hulls says.

Mr Hulls yesterday defended the legislation, which he opposed, and dismissed
Archbishop Denis Hart's claim it would pose a ``real threat'' to the Catholic
church's wide network of hospitals.

``Catholic hospitals, as I understand it, now don't perform abortion procedures
and there is no forcing of any hospitals to perform abortions,'' he said.

``The legislation actually says if a doctor has an ethical view that they don't
want to perform an abortion they are to refer a woman to a hospital or a doctor
that doesn't have such an ethical issue.''

But it was exactly that referral process Archbishop Hart identified as the
problematic element of the Bill.

In a pastoral letter -- parts of which were in yesterday's Herald Sun -- he
warned parishioners that Catholic staff would face the prospect of breaking the
law if they wanted to maintain their anti-abortion stance.

Mr Hulls said he understood Archbishop Hart's passionate view on the issue but
said the legislation was clear.

``If people or hospitals have, for whatever reason, an ethical issue in relation
to that, they simply won't perform those procedures,'' he said.
