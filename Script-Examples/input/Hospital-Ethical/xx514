Sick Kids' lottery

We were extremely disappointed to hear a radio ad for the Hospital for Sick
Children lottery. A few years ago, a spokesman for the hospital was quoted in
the Star as saying that the hospital had once run a lottery but had decided
never again. It had decided it was wrong to appeal to people's greed rather than
their charitable instincts, especially since it was a children's hospital and
should be setting a good example.

As a result of this rare ethical stance, the hospital became one of our
favourite charities. We're sorry now to have to cross it off our list. What
happened?
