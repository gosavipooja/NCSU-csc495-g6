'Advertising' by docs: Lodge a complaint

                            October 14, 2005 Friday


I REFER to the letter, 'Does media exposure constitute ads by docs?' (ST, Oct
4), by Dr Michael Loh.

Health-care institutions are allowed to provide information about the services
they provide to members of the public through advertisements. This is regulated
by the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics (Publicity) Regulations 2004.

The provision of information by doctors is governed by the Singapore Medical
Council (SMC)'s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines.

If Dr Loh is of the view that certain advertisements or information provided
compromise ethical standards, it would be appropriate for him to lodge a formal
complaint with the SMC for the Complaints Committee's investigation.

The SMC will not pass judgment on a case without having conducted a proper
investigation or hearing.
