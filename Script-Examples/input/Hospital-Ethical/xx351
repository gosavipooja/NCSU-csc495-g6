   NIAGARA FALLS (Staff) - Dr. Henry Morgentaler was honored last night by an
international humanist organization as 17 pickets protested the right for women
to obtain abortions.

The International Humanist and Ethical Union, holding its tenth annual
conference this week at the State University of New York, gave an award to
Morgentaler, who performed abortions in defiance of Canadian law for many years
and is a pioneer in the pro-choice movement.

"It was a pretty orderly demonstration," said Niagara police guarding the
entrance to a hotel banquet room where Morgentaler spoke.

Morgentaler, one of the conference's most controversial speakers, said Canada
had no need of a new law to control abortion. He also rejected suggestions that
Canadian hospitals and clinics have been in chaos since the Supreme Court struck
down the abortion law this spring.

The humanists, whose members include Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov and
several United Nations founders, are an international coalition of organizations
for non-religious ethical values.
