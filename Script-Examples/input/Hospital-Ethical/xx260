Ban on poaching nurses ignored

Ethical guidelines to stop hospitals poaching nurses from the poorest countries
are being ignored by private recruiting agencies, the Royal College of Nursing
warns.

The college highlighted figures posted yesterday on the website of the NHS
Employers' organisation, showing that only 140 of the 800 agencies supplying
temporary staff to hospitals and nursing homes had agreed to comply with the
government's ethical code.

Agencies can supply staff to private sector hospitals and care homes even if
they have not signed the code. Overseas nurses who have worked briefly in the
private sector can later move into the NHS.

NHS Employers said only 47 agencies provided references from NHS organisations
confirming they complied with the code, which includes a ban on active
recruitment in sub-Saharan Africa and other countries short of medical staff.
About 3,300 nurses and midwives from countries on the banned list joined the UK
nursing register in 2004/5.

Janet Davies, the RCN's executive director, said: "Our principle concern is that
the code of practice . . . allows for backdoor recruitment from countries on the
Department of Health's banned list."
