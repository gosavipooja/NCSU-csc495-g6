LENGTH: 235  words


The catering team at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital (RBH) has been awarded a
Silver Standard from the Soil Association in its first entry to the Food for
Life Award.

The Soil Association encourages responsible farming and healthy eating in
balance with the environment and has recognised the hospital's efforts to ensure
the food served in the Shelley Restaurant is healthy, ethical and uses local
ingredients.

In order to achieve the Silver Standard, the team met a number of criteria,
including preparing 75 per cent of food freshly on site, ensuring all food is
free from controversial additives like colouring and artificial trans fats, as
well as purchasing farm-assured, sustainable, free range and organic products
from local sources, where possible.

Andy Whittingham, head of catering at RBH, said: "We're delighted our efforts to
source ethical products have been acknowledged. It's important our produce is
the best possible quality as well as affordable - I'd say we've managed to
achieve this and being endorsed by the Soil Association shows our dedication to
delivering the best quality to the staff and patients we serve.

"As a hospital, we make our way through a huge quantity of produce each year -
38,112 pints of milk, 107,280 eggs and 4,120kg of cheese to name just some of
our staple ingredients - so it's important we buy organically and ethically,
considering our impact on the environment."
