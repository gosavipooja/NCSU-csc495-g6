TEXT:
 [*358]

   This textbook employs the realistic setting of the hospital ethics committee
to develop understanding of philosophical and ethical concepts in the field of
bioethics. It is based on the premise that students and practitioners need to
reflect upon the ethical decisions that are being made by ethics committees in
hospitals and nursing homes. Clarification and comment is based on philosophical
theory. Use of dialogue among ethics committee members is designed to help the
reader appreciate the philosophical, conceptual, and practical aspects of
ethical decisions made by these institutions. The mixture of the ethics
committee approach with philosophical theory constitutes the core of the text.
Chapters include an introduction to ethics committees, foregoing treatment,
euthanasia, informed consent, reproductive rights and surrogacy, abortion,
rationing health care, AIDS, medical research, and pediatric ethics.
