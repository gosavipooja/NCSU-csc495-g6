Nonprofit status best for Jackson Brook

Thank you for your June 27 editorial in favor of making Jackson Brook Institute
nonprofit. The Physicians for a National Health Program would agree. They make
three arguments for nonprofit hospitals (in the publication, "For Our Patients,
Not for Profits," $ 10. To obtain a copy, write 332 South Michigan, Suite 500,
Chicago IL 60604).

In comparison to for-profit hospitals, nonprofits cost less, provide much more
charity care and help create a more ethical health care system.

Nonprofit psychiatric hospitals provide four times as much charity care than
for-profits.

Nonprofit hospitals help create a health care system with higher ethical
standards than the system proposed by for-profits.

As for-profit hospitals and HMOs have increased their influence, fraud has
increased. From 1992 to 1996, FBI convictions for health-care fraud increased
340 percent.

Making Jackson Brook Institute nonprofit is one step toward a more financially
efficient, fair and ethical health care system for all citizens.

There will be a public hearing on these issues on Aug. 19. Please call your
legislators and Speaker of the House Elizabeth Mitchell. Please urge them to
hold the hearing in Portland.

It was recently proposed that the location of the hearing would be moved to
Augusta, which would prevent many people from attending.

Duncan Wright, M.D.
