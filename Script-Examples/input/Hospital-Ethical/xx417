To help animals, actress KIM BASINGER will give the shirt off her back. In fact,
to help fight the fur-coat trade, she's giving the shirt, the skirt and all the
rest.

A new poster unveiled this week shows Basinger clad in nothing but her own skin.
The poster's message: "Beauty Is Not About Wearing Someone Else's Coat."

Basinger and her husband, actor ALEC BALDWIN, have helped to raise $ 50, 000 for
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

ABC's DIANE SAWYER is going nowhere, at a considerable boost in pay.  Despite
courting from rival networks, Sawyer has decided to stay put - for $ 5 million
to $ 6 million a year. She now gets nearly $ 3 million.  Sick call:

LIZ TAYLOR will check into a hospital next month to get a replacement for her
61-year-old hip. The cartilage in Taylor's left hip has worn out, causing
painful bone-on-bone contact, her doctor says.

Actress CARRIE FISHER has pneumonia but expects to be out of the hospital soon.
Fisher, 37, checked into a Los Angeles hospital Tuesday afternoon.

In his new autobiography, country singer CHARLEY PRIDE says he has battled manic
depression throughout his career. "I still sort of halfway want to deny it," he
tells The Tennessean, a newspaper. Pride, 55, has been taking drugs for his
ailment since 1968.

Ever since the Bolsheviks shot Czar Nicholas and his wife and children,
Britain's royal family has understandably avoided Russian soil. But now, the
Bolsheviks are out of business - and now, the czar's distant cousin, QUEEN
ELIZABETH II, is expected to accept a longstanding invitation to visit.

Roseanne Roundup, Part I: In an interview to air tonight on "20/20," singer
BRANDI BROWN describes the day a private investigator told her about her
biological mother, who had given the girl up for adoption 22 years earlier.

"I'm a singer," Brown says, "so I said, 'It's got to be BETTE MIDLER. I know
it's Bette Midler.' And he goes, 'No.'

"And I go, "It's BARBRA STREISAND.' . . . He goes, 'It's ROSEANNE BARR (ARNOLD)'

"And all I knew growing up was that I was Jewish. So I said, 'She's Jewish?' "

Roseanne Roundup, Part II: Newsday says ABC is almost certain to broadcast on
March 1 a much talked-about episode of "Roseanne" in which MARIEL HEMINGWAY
kisses ROSEANNE ARNOLD. Newsday says it would guarantee huge ratings, which ABC
- battered by the Olympics on CBS - needs.  ON THIS DAY On Feb. 18, 1953, "Bwana
Devil" - the first (and maybe the worst) of the 3-D movies - opened in New York.
