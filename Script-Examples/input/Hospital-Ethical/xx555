REVEALED: THE NHS IMAM WHO OPPOSES ORGAN TRANSPLANTS

BYLINE: BY NO BYLINE AVAILABLE

LENGTH: 251 words


A HARDLINE imam who opposes organ transplants and abortions is being employed as
a Muslim chaplain by the NHS.

Sheikh Suliman Gani has been giving spiritual and ethical advice at St George's
Hospital in Tooting, South London, for the past three years. It is believed that
he may have received as much as £50,000 in salary in total.

But The Mail on Sunday has discovered he is a staunch opponent of organ
transplants, even when it is required to save lives, and has debated the point
on TV channels. Mr Gani also believes homosexuality is unnatural, and has
described women as subservient' to men. A Muslim leader who knows Mr Gani said
it is dangerous for him to be working as a hospital chaplain. He said: Suppose
someone comes to him for ethical advice on a heart or a liver transplant.

His advice could be "no", and they could act on it. This is dangerous,
irresponsible, and wrong, as Muslim scholars have said organ transplant is
perfectly permissible.'

But on a Channel 4 talk show in 2007, Mr Gani said that organ donation was
desecration' of a the body, which is sacred. He added that the organ does not
belong to the donor but is given in trust from God. Last night, Mr Gani defended
his views, but said: In my hospital work, I am trained to be impartial, to be
sensitive and to not impose my views on others. I support families and mention
both valid views on organ transplants and let them decide.'

St George's Hospital said that it had never received a formal complaint about Mr
Gani.
