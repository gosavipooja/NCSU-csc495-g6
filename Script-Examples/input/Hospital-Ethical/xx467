ORGAN SCANDALS HIT ETHICAL RESEARCH

SECTION: First Edition; NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 151 words


Scandals in the UK involving the retention of children's organs by hospitals led
to a fall in donations for proper ethical research, a study revealed today.

There was widespread outrage after it emerged in 1999 that some hospitals,
including Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, had kept thousands of
youngsters' organs without the knowledge of their families.

As a result legitimate medical research has been hampered due to a fall in
tissue being donated, according to researchers in the British Medical Journal.

They said that registrations of tumour samples in the national children's tumour
bank fell during the height of the organ retention controversy.

The samples are taken during procedures to diagnose and treat cancer after
consent is granted by the families.

These samples are then used by medical researchers in their studies to help
improve cancer treatments
