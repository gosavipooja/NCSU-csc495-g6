Home-grown produce puts patients on road to recovery

LENGTH: 162 words


FOOD from local farmers and suppliers is now being used in meals for patients
and staff in hospitals in east Kent.

A series of events have taken place at which suppliers, ethical organisations
and dieticians have shown off their produce.

The groups held tasting sessions and answered questions from staff, patients and
visitors in the hospitals'  Spice of Life restaurants.

The Fairtrade Foundation, an apple grower and sausage producer from Kent, a
dietician and others have visited the hospitals to show how catering company
Medirest supports local, sustainable and ethical products, as well as promoting
health and wellbeing.

Medirest will be using local produce in the dishes served in the hospitals'
on-site restaurants.

The programme started on September 28 to coincide with British Food Fortnight,
and last week suppliers of fish were in the restaurant at Kent and Canterbury
Hospital.

More 'meet the grower' visits are planned at the hospital on Wednesdays from
11am-2pm.
