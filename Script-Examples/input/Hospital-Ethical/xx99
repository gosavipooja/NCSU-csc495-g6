Nurses are faced with ethical dilemma

SECTION: HEALTH

FOR five days nurses at Tembisa Hospital faced an ethical dilemma whether to let
patients go home or treat them in overflowing wards.


 Gauteng health department spokesman Simon Zwane said from Sunday all 840 beds
were occupied. He said the influx of patients was caused by the temporary
closure of other hospitals in Ekurhuleni.
  "The situation presented us with an ethical dilemma whether to send patients
home or keep them in the hospital while they got the required treatment and wait
for beds to be available."
 He said they kept psychiatric patients for only 72 hours.
 But the national director of the SA Federation for Mental Health, Bharti Patel,
said according to the Mental Health Care Act, any establishment that provides
treatment or care for mentally ill patients "may not continue to provide care,
treatment and rehabilitation services to the user for longer than 24 hours
unless an application is made (to the provincial review board) within 24 hours".
