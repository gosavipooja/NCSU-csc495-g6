Ethical conduct article: correction;
News in Brief

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 98 words


The headline of an article about a new code of ethical business conduct at Our
Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin ("Union fury as hospital staff 'gagged' by
HSE", Sunday, June 12) incorrectly suggested that the Health Service Executive
was responsible for restricting employees from making public criticisms of the
hospital. The HSE had no involvement whatsoever in the code of ethical business
conduct published by Our Lady's Children's Hospital, which is a public voluntary
hospital managed by its own board of management. We are happy to correct the
record and apologise for the error.
