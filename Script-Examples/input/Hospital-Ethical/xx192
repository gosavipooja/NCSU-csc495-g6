O'Farrell demands inquiry;
HOSPITALS IN CRISIS

STATE Parliament's upper house will be asked to conduct a full inquiry into the
way the Children's Hospital at Westmead used funds from public donations to pay
for the salaries of cleaners, security staff and doctors.

This follows last week's revelations in The Sun-Herald that the cash-strapped
hospital diverted $2.5 million in donated funds to operational costs.

Shadow health minister Barry O'Farrell said yesterday the Opposition would call
for the inquiry when Parliament resumed on February 17.

It would have the power to call Westmead administrators, including chief
executive Professor Kim Oates, and Health Department bureaucrats.

Mr O'Farrell has also written to anti-corruption commissioner Irene Moss asking
her to investigate the use of donated funds when cash-squeezed hospitals are
under-funded by the NSW Government.

Westmead's board of directors passed a motion on Wednesday backing the
administration as "caring, ethical and financially sound".

The motion said: "The board confirmed that the decision previously taken to use
untagged donations was legal, ethical and taken in the best interests of the
hospital's patients, staff and donors, as well as other stakeholders such as
Government and Health [Department]."

The board's former treasurer David Say, who resigned in protest against the
allocation of donations to hospital running costs, said he hoped his resignation
had put hospital under-funding on the agenda.
