I've done nothing wrong insists MMR jab doctor

SECTION: NEWS; 4

LENGTH: 214  words


CHILDREN taking part in research on the MMR jab were never tested in breach of
ethical rules, the doctor who triggered the scare about the triple vaccine said
yesterday.

At a hearing in London Dr Andrew Wakefield accused his hospital ethics boss, Dr
Michael Pegg, of being wrong in his assertion to the General Medical Council
that research was unapproved. He said Dr Pegg's memory was at fault.

He added: "In terms of the clinical investigations, there was no approval
because there was no need. But he did approve the research investigations as
described in the application for ethical approval." And he said he had a letter
from the ethics committee at the Royal Free Hospital, north-west London, giving
the go-ahead for his study. Dr Wakefield and colleagues Professor John
Walker-Smith and Professor Simon Murch are accused of invasive procedures
including colonoscopy and lumbar punctures on autistic children.

Dr Andrew Wakefield - accused of tests on children that had not been given
ethical clearance - has linked autism and bowel diseases to the triple measles,
mumps and rubella vaccination.

The 51-year-old doctor denies serious professional misconduct. He faces being
struck off after charges of abusing his position and acting dishonestly and
irresponsibly.

The hearing continues.
