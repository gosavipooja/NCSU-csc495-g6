ROW OVER 'ILLEGAL TRIALS';

SECTION:  Pg. 2

LENGTH: 277 words


THE controversy surrounding the over-charging of cancer patients at St Vincent's
has led to an unprecedented row between consultants and management amid
allegations that doctors were in effect carrying out illegal clinical trials on
patients.

The dispute centres over whether clinical trials conducted at St Vincent's
Private Hospital were covered by the oversight of the Ethics Committee at the
nearby St Vincent's University Hospital, which is funded in the main by the
state.

Such studies carried out without ethical oversight would be illegal under the
Clinical Trials Act.

Top cancer specialist John Crown, who is at the centre of the current dispute,
and other doctors at St Vincent's Private Hospital, have said that two former
chief executives of the centre had maintained that trials carried out there were
covered by the Ethics Committee of the public hospital.

Management of St Vincent's University Hospital has strongly denied this and said
that it has never had any role in in the review, approval or rejection of
trials.

However, this stance has been opposed by the doctor who chaired the Ethical
Research Committee at St Vincent's University Hospital when the cancer drug
trials at the centre of the over-charging row were launched. The Irish Medicines
Board has suspended all trials at the hospital pending a review.

The IMB has stated that patient safety was not at issue.

Supporters of Crown maintain that the issue of ethical approval for the trials
was only brought up by management after he effectively blew the whistle on the
hospital over-charging patients for free drugs by hundreds of thousands of euro.
