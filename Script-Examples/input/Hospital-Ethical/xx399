Pet centre at shops

MILL PARK is now home to the world's first non-profit pet adoption centre in a
pet store.

Victoria's largest animal hospital, the Lort Smith Animal Hospital has joined
forces with pet department store, Pets at Home, to expand its animal services
into the first pet-adoption centre at Mill Park's Westfield Plenty Valley.

Television star and animal lover Georgie Parker launched the partnership last
month.

Lort Smith chief executive Ric Holland said the historic agreement would see
more pet adoptions to good homes in Melbourne.

``It's a unique situation as traditionally, worldwide animal welfare
organisations and pet stores are deadly enemies,'' he said.

``But our arrangement with Pets at Home is special particularly because
worldwide they are known for their ethical trading of pets. They have said they
won't sell any dog or cat.''

Mr Holland said the Mill Park centre would offer the same adoption services as
the North Melbourne hospital.

``Pets at Home have staff trained to the same level as our staff at the
hospital,'' he said.

``The store makes no profit from the adoptions as the fees go straight back to
the (Lort Smith) hospital.

``We are very proud of this relationship with Pets at Home as it is mutually
beneficial for the both of us as we create new homes for pets and they can show
they are a different and ethical pet store.''

As well as the adoption centre, Lort Smith has also set up a veterinary clinic
at the Mill Park store.
