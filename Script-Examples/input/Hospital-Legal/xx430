Employers must pay for work-related injuries

LENGTH: 241  words


Employers are obliged to pay for the treatment of employees for injuries
sustained at work in accordance with Article 33 of the national labor law, said
Bandar Al-Amoudi, a prominent Saudi lawyer.


Payment will have to be made either directly or indirectly and includes hospital
stay, medical tests and analysis, X-rays and compensatory equipment, in addition
to transportation to the place of treatment.
"The labor law provision stipulates that injuries be classified within
categories according to a social insurance system," he said. "Vocational
illnesses are classified within a work injury system and patient history will
begin from the first medical citation of the illness."
The law obliges employers to bear all expenses arising from work-related
injuries, including compensatory damages.
"Employers will also be obliged to pay expenses for fatal cases resulting from
work-related injuries, in addition to compensation," he said.
Hospitals, however, will be obliged to pay compensatory damage if hospital
negligence is proven in taking preventive measures against infection.
Such legal action may be followed by state or Health Ministry intervention.
Authorities can take dramatic legal action against hospital administrations and
workers and the hospital might even be closed down temporarily pending
investigation.
The hospital might face permanent closure if investigation reveals that it poses
a danger to patients.Â© 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.
