Govt slammed over absence of female MLOs in city

SECTION: Vol. 31 No. 83

LENGTH: 215  words


Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) legislator Khurrum Sherzaman on Saturday
expressed outrage over a lack of female medico-legal officers (MLOs) in three
major Karachi hospitals.

Sherzaman said that only five MLOs were available at city hospitals -- Jinnah
Post Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) and Abbasi
Shaheed Hospital. Out of these five female MLOs, two are on medical leave.

The neglect regarding availability of female MLOs in Karachi by the PPP
government in Sindh is surprising given that it claims to be a 'champion' of
women's rights in Pakistan.

As per rules, every government hospital should have additional police surgeon of
grade-19, two senior female medico-legal officers of grade-18 and three female
medico-legal officers of grade-17. Accordingly, Karachi should have 71 MLOs of
which nine should be female.

He underlined the importance of MLOs when it comes to the criminal justice
system in Pakistan in terms of investigation process as they conduct autopsies
and examine the victims of violent crimes such as rapes in order to aid the
court and prosecution in criminal cases.

Sherzaman demanded that the chief minister and the home minister immediately
fill the vacancies of female MLOs at Jinnah Hospital, Civil Hospital and Abbasi
Shaheed Hospital.
