AHMEDABAD: The city police commissioner has issued a notification on the basis
of a state-wide notice by the state DGP that the medico-legal fee charged by
government and private hospitals will be illegal henceforth.

It came to notice of the senior officials recently that a hospital had charged
Rs 3,000 from a patient in Naroda towards a medico-legal case. When questioned,
the hospital trust officials said that the money goes to the doctors as they
have to go to the courts in connection with the case - leaving their work at the
hospital behind and they are not paid anything additional.

"As per the notification, all private hospitals are banned from taking such fees
as it is illegal. The state medical council will be involved in the decision and
such activities would be brought to the notice of the Medical Council of India
for punitive action," said a senior city police official.
