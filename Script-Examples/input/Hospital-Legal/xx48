NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has kicked off a lengthy process
to ban hospitals in Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth and a found simple solution already
under its belt. Legal experts have said that the civic chief already has powers
to not sanction hospitals or any type of buildings citing problems prevailing in
the respective areas.

Following public outcry and strong demand for blanket ban on new hospitals in
Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth, the NMC town planning department asked for legal advice
from a panel of advocates. NMC officials told TOI that according to the legal
advice obtained a couple of days ago, the municipal commissioner himself may
maintain ban on approving hospital buildings in Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth citing
strong opposition and too many hospitals in a small area. "The department will
submit the legal advice to municipal commissioner Shyam Wardhane for further
decision," he said.

The plan was to seek legal advice and submit it to mayor Anil Sole for framing
policy in the general body for the ban. Now, it will be interesting to see
whether the administration goes to the general body or issues any circular
imposing ban on new hospital buildings. The general body has already passed a
resolution not to permit new hospitals in the two localities till a policy is
framed.
