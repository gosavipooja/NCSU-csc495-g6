Children's hospital could be delayed further

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 255 words


Doctors at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin have sought legal
advice with a view to taking a judicial review of the decision to locate the new
800 million national children's hospital at the Mater Hospital site in Dublin.

If the review goes ahead it could delay the national hospital project further.
''There is a genuine belief that the decision which has been made is not in the
best interests of the one million children in this country," said a
paediatrician at the Crumlin hospital. ''We don't want to see children's care
compromised for the next 50 years."

The full design brief for the new hospital is expected to be completed in
December 2008. It will be December 2009 by the time planning approval and
construction procurement will get underway. A judicial review can take up to two
years, although the president of the High Court has the power to speed up the
legal process.

The medical board at Crumlin has sought legal advice and has contacted a
prominent Dublin barrister.

Members of the hospital board, which is chaired by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin,
are aware of the move. A board member said there was ''deep dissatisfaction''
with the Mater proposal. The board has not signalled whether it would back a
legal challenge.

Doctors at Crumlin believe the Mater move would present huge logistical issues.
They said the original McKinsey model for one super hospital had been changed to
a fragmented model including a dissemination of services over three or four
sites with duplication of services and staff.
