Stolen bones: law firm launches action

LENGTH: 200 words


A SHEFFIELD law firm is launching legal action on behalf of UK hospital patients
who may have received stolen bones - including parts taken from the body of
American broadcaster Alistair Cooke.

As many as 25 hospitals including the Northern General Hospital and Doncaster
Royal Infirmary, took delivery of bones bought by a British company, which
provides tissue and body parts to NHS and private British hospitals, imported
from an American company called Biomedical Tissue Services.

Police in New York are investigating claims the American firm took tissue and
bones without the consent of dead people's next of kin, and sold it for
operations to hospitals.

Deliveries could have included bone stolen from the body of veteran broadcaster
Alistair Cooke who died aged 95 in 2004.

Both the Northern General Hospital and Doncaster Royal Infirmary have made it
clear they did not know the bone was stolen. The bone was returned and not used
to treat patients.

Now Sheffield-based solicitors Irwin Mitchell are launching legal action on
behalf of other patients elsewhere in the country.

Clive Garner, a partner said: At present we do not know just how many people
have been treated with these bone products."
