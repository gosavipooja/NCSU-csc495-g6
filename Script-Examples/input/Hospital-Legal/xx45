BIRMINGHAM legal executives donned football shorts and shirts to raise more than
pounds 11,000 for the city's Diana, Princess of Wales Children's Hospital.

Members of the Institute of Legal Executives began fund-raising in July when
they took part in the institute's national five-a-side charity football
competition.

They handed over a giant cheque to children's hospital director Judge Estella
Hindley, QC, at the institute's Birmingham and District branch annual ball at
the Botanical Gardens, in Edgbaston. The money will be used to buy a new neo
