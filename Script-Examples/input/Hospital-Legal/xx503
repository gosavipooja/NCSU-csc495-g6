Legal bid to stop hospital sale A GROUP of Mackay doctors is considering a legal
challenge to stop the Sisters of Mercy from buying the Pioneer Valley Hospital
and closing its in- vitro fertilisation clinic.

The Catholic order is also understood to be bidding for the Townsville Hospital
and would also close its clinic, leaving Brisbane with Queensland's only IVF
clinics.

Shareholders will decide on the sisters' undisclosed offer for the Mackay
hospital at a meeting on January 12.

They will also consider whatever other offers have been made for the complex.

Mackay Regional Development Bureau manager Matthew Magin said if the sale went
through, the church would own both Mackay private hospitals; the other being the
Mater.

Both Townsville and Mackay hospitals host clinics, run by the Queensland
Fertility Council, for four weeks twice a year.

Council senior director John Hennessey said it was doubtful that the Mackay Base
Hospital could take over the Pioneer Valley program.

He said the clinic was likely to be shifted to Rockhampton where some private
hospitals had shown interest in hosting the program.
