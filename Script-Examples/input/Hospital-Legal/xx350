Former Bath Community Hospital doctor takes legal action against CEO, board
members

LENGTH: 120  words


A doctor at the center of a controversy in Bath County is now taking legal
action.
Dr. James Redington filed a 20-page civil suit Thursday afternoon in Bath
County, according to a court clerk.


The complaint names Redington's Bath Community Hospital as well the hospital's
current CEO and board members David Troast and Sarah McWilliams.
Redington is asking for $5 million dollars from each of the four defendants and
hundreds of thousands more in punitive damages.
Redington's complaint stems from the Bath Community Hospital board's decision to
not renew his contract.
Hundreds of residents have spoken out about his termination. A handful of other
doctors have resigned from the hospital as well. 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.
