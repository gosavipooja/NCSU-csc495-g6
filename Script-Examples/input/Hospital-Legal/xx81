Two legal advocacy groups accused an Oklahoma children's hospital Wednesday of
withholding life-saving treatment from severely handicapped infants whose
families were deemed unable to care for them properly.

Lawyers for the National Legal Center for the Medically Dependent and Disabled
and the American Civil Liberties Union made the charges at a news conference
here against the Oklahoma Children's Memorial Hospital in Oklahoma City.

James Bopp, the center's president, charged that low-income parents of infants
with severe birth defects were told their children could not survive corrective
surgery or that they would be severely mentally and physically handicapped. The
organizations said they would file suit against the hospital unless it agreed to
stop using quality-of-life standards for withholding medical care.

Robert Fulton, director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Resources, said in
response to the charges, ''Children in this hospital are getting proper care.''
