THE vast majority of people in Liverpool support the re-building of the Royal
hospital, even with the funding mechanism known as PFI.

How dare Mr Sam Semoff and a small group of supporters from Keep the NHS Public
decide they know best what we need.

I can't believe we, the people of this great city, can allow these political
activists to threaten this project by their legal challenge. What makes it even
more sick is they are preventing us, honest taxpayers, from having our new
hospital with their legal costs paid for under legal aid, by each of us. That is
a scandal.

I have spoken to many people who are not supporters of PFI, but even they
realise the hospital will not be built unless we go down this route.

We are in danger of losing this project and the chance of a new hospital because
of the ideology of a small unelected and undemocratic group.

Will Mr Semoff be content and happy when the PFI is cancelled, not because of
his no-hope legal challenge, but because the delays he has caused has led to the
scheme running out of time? We will then be stuck with those existing, crumbling
buildings for many decades, no PFI, but no new state of the art hospital to
deliver good health care.

Mr Semoff says it's more than about buildings. Come off it Sam, stop dragging
the people of this city into your crazy world of sad politics.

Reginald Hyland, Liverpool city centre
