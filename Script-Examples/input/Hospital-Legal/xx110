BOSSES at Singleton Hospital are predicting a jump in the number of complaints
against the hospital this year.

But the number of court actions against the hospital is expected to fall.

The reason, according chief executive at the hospital David Will-iams, is
changes to legal aid legislation.

Tougher

He said the Government had made it tougher for people to receive legal aid when
trying to sue organisations, including hospitals.

"Solicitors are likely to advise their clients to initially pursue the
complaints procedure before contemplating any legal action," said Mr Williams.

"We are quite sure that the number of complaints will rise this year and the
number of legal actions will drop slightly," added Mr Williams

He said there had been 52 complaints against Swansea NHS Trust, which runs
Singleton, in 1997 -98.

That figure compared with 54 the previous year.

The trust also received 1,404 letters of appreciation in the three months up to
the end of March, compared to 1,232 in the same period the year before.
