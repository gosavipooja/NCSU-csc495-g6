HIGHLIGHT: BEDBLOCKER: Baljit Singh refused to leave Walsgrave Hospital but has
now been forced out by a court order


HEALTH bosses have had to take legal action to evict a patient who refused to
leave Walsgrave Hospital.

Baljit Singh arrived in this country a few weeks ago and went straight to the
hospital for treatment for a kidney complaint.

He was treated but when doctors tried to discharge him he refused to go and took
out a high court injunction.

The hospital won the right to turf him out on Monday ! now he has launched a new
legal bid to get the council to provide him with housing.

The cases have already totted up a bill of tens of thousands of pounds ! all
funded by the tax payer.

Alice Casey, chief operating officer for University Hospitals Coventry and
Warwickshire NHS Trust, which runs Walsgrave, said: "This is an extremely
unusual situation for our hospital and we have done everything in our power to
discharge Mr Singh without resorting to legal action.

"Unfortunately, although he has been assessed as medically fit to be discharged
for some time he has refused to leave and took out an injunction against the
Trust to prevent us from discharging him.

"It is entirely appropriate for Mr Singh to be treated as an outpatient for his
dialysis, he does not need a hospital bed."

Coventry city council today confirmed it was also involved in legal action with
Mr Singh.

The high court has ordered sociial services to provide him with accommodation
while proceedings continue.
