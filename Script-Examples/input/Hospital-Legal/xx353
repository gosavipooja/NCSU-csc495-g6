Surgeons seek legal protection

Christchurch Hospital is not affected by the staff shortages that have led
Wellington surgeons to seek legal immunity from medical misadventure claims.

Surgeons at Wellington Hospital have asked Capital Coast Health to grant them
legal immunity from medical misadventure claims and disciplinary action because
they believe nursing shortages are endangering patient safety. Wellington
Hospital has only two-thirds of the 60 nurses it needs to run its intensive care
unit.

Christchurch Hospital Medical Staff Association chairman David Shaw said to his
knowledge that situation was not happening here.

"Things must be getting pretty desperate. I've never heard of any doctor having
to do that before."

He said when there had been staff shortages at Christchurch Hospital in the past
surgeons had stopped operating.

"But we've had an incredibly mild winter in Christchurch so the strain on our
staffing has not been that great."

Canterbury Health chief executive Richard Webb would not comment but said the
situation did not apply here.

Health and Disability Commissioner Ron Paterson was critical of the move by
Wellington surgeons. He said he could empathise with doctors' concerns but they
had a legal and ethical duty to provide care.

"I don't think it's a good look for doctors to say 'we won't practice unless our
butts are covered'," he said.
