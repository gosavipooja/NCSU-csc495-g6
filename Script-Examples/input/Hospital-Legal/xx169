QUEENSLAND'S first hospital-based Health Justice Partnership, supporting women
experiencing domestic and family violence at Logan Hospital, will be extended to
other Metro South Health facilities.

A year after the launch of the initiative, Logan Hospital Health Justice
Partnership solicitor Gail Shearer said women needing assistance at Redland,
QEII and Princess Alexandra hospitals would also have access to free, on-site
family law, domestic violence and child protection legal advice provided by the
Women's Legal Service.

She said she had received 120 referrals over the year.

"While most of the women referred to me have been by hospital staff, 12 women
also self-referred, with four becoming case clients and two ladies requiring
further referral to the Women's Legal Service Domestic Violence Unit for
intensive legal and social work support," Ms Shearer said.Metro South Health
acting chief executive Robert Mackway-Jones said he was pleased so many women
had been helped by the service.
