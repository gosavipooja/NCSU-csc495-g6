SECTION: Vol. LXVIII No. 32

LENGTH: 177  words


The Sindh health department is in the process of posting medico-legal officers
(MLOs) at six more government hospitals to ease the burden on the three major
hospitals - the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and
Civil Hospital Karachi - in the metropolis, it emerged on Saturday.

"We are in the process of posting MLOs in six more government hospitals in
Karachi, which could take a few weeks," said a senior official in the provincial
health department while speaking to Dawn.

Officials said the department had promoted a number of doctors from grade- 17 to
18, some of whom were going to be posted as MLOs in the Lyari General Hospital,
Sindh Government Hospital New Karachi, Sindh Govt Hospital Liaquatabad, Sindh
Govt Hospital Saudabad, Sindh Govt Qatar Hospital Orangi Town and Sindh Govt
Hospital Korangi.

"Since the situation in the city is consistently volatile and the number of
medico-legal cases have substantially increased over the past three years or so,
it is needed that the burden be shifted elsewhere," said the official.
