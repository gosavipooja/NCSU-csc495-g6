Sales touts facing hospital legal move

LENGTH: 236 words


Hospital bosses are considering taking legal action against hard-sell salesmen
who are preying on vulnerable accident and emergency patients.

Compensation companies, offering 'no win, no fee' legal representation, have
been caught touting for business in the casualty department at Chesterfield
Royal Hospital.

One sales representative had to be escorted off the premises by an off-duty
policeman and security staff. Others have been spotted approaching people who
were visiting outpatient clinics for treatment.

Sarah Turner-Saint, Head of Communications at the Royal, said: "We realise
obviously that people have accidents and there are occasions when they may be
entitled to compensation.

"But from our point of view, we feel targeting patients in the accident and
emergency department when they have actually had the accident and are waiting to
be treated is not the right way to go about marketing and touting for this kind
of business."

Mrs Turner-Saint confirmed that managers of the hospital ? which does not allow
advertising of any form on its property ? are seeking legal advice following
complaints from patients.

Chesterfield Royal Hospital is the largest in north Derbyshire, serving a
population of around 375,000. More than 3,000 staff work for the Chesterfield
Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and the hospital has around 570 beds.
