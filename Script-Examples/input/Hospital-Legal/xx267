A further 19 hospitals are to have their links with Jimmy Savile investigated.

In a written ministerial statement, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he
expected reports to be delivered by next June. The hospitals will be
investigated by their relevant health trusts but each investigation will be
properly monitored.

They are in addition to an initial 13 inquiries into hospitals which are
believed to have been visited by the disgraced television presenter. Savile is
thought to have used his position to abuse vulnerable patients, many of them
children.

After details first emerged about cases of alleged abuse by Savile in hospitals,
three major investigations were launched at Leeds General Infirmary, Stoke
Mandeville Hospital and Broadmoor Hospital.

Further investigations were then announced at ten hospitals across the country.

Liz Dux, a lawyer specialising in abuse at legal firm Slater & Gordon which is
representing 72 victims, said there were concerns that inquiries into other
hospitals had only just started.

She said all of the victims represented by her firm had given detailed
statements to Operation Yewtree - the police investigation into sexual abuse
sparked by the Savile scandal.
