   Doctors Hospital has given up a legal fight to stay open.

Faced with financial and community pressures, the hospital opted not to launch
an appeal of a Divisional Court ruling that confirmed the Health Services
Restructuring Commission's power to close it down.

Instead, it is ready to sit down with Toronto Hospital and negotiate, Doctors
Hospital president Brian McFarlane said yesterday.

"This is a new chapter. We have to move on," he said.

Doctors Hospital, in the city's west end, is slated to be closed by the end of
next year and its programs moved to Toronto's Western division where an
ambulatory care centre will be set up.

The deadline to file an appeal was today1, but McFarlane said the case wouldn't
have been heard until the new year.

"That's time and money - and time is money," he said.

The hospital has already spent more than $200,000 in legal costs fighting its
closing, he added.

Doctors was among four Metro hospitals that launched court actions against the
restructuring commission's decision to close them down. Women's College
Hospital, Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital, and Wellesley Central Hospital
have all now agreed to negotiate at the table, although Wellesley has also
served notice of an appeal.Ontario; Health; Services; Restructuring; Commission;
