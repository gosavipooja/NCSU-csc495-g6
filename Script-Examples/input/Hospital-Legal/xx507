DHAG pays £26k for failed hospital legal challenge

LENGTH: 204  words


Campaigners will have to pay £26,500 for the failed legal challenge to the
downgrading of Hemel Hempstead Hospital.

Dacorum Hospital Action Group (DHAG) has handed the cash to West Herts Hospitals
NHS Trust to help cover its legal costs for the High Court action last year.

The judicial review was based on the way the decision was taken to shift full
A&E to Watford and planned surgery to St Albans.

The judge ordered DHAG to pay 40 per cent of the trust's legal bill after ruling
the decision to move services out of the town had been made fairly.

The community raised thousands of pounds in a Gazette-backed campaign in support
of DHAG to allow the review to take place.

This means the action group still has £23,000 left in its fighting fund.

DHAG chairman Zena Bullmore said: "Thanks to the generous donations from Dacorum
citizens, and beyond, and to the publicity given by The Gazette, we have £23,000
left to continue our campaign after paying the legal costs."

She said the closures in Hemel Hempstead had resulted in a worse service to
patients.

"We therefore in justice request that Hemel Hempstead Hospital's orthopaedic
operating theatres and wards, and the other lost services, are returned at a
very early date," she said.
