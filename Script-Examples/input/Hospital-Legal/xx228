A Former hospital matron at the centre of a legal battle about the treatment of
the elderly died in hospital yesterday. On Monday, a High Court judge ordered
doctors at the Norfolk University Hospital, Norwich, to feed and treat
91-year-old Olive Nockels.

Members of her family had launched a legal action claiming that the hospital was
leaving the pensioner to die.

Mrs Nockels' grandson, Chris West, 32, of Norwich, said he would continue with
the legal action in the High Court.

"We have got legal aid and we won't let this drop," he said.
