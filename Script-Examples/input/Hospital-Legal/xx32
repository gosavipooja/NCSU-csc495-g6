Tarpon loses lawsuit over legal fees

SECTION: NORTH PINELLAS TIMES; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 144 words

DATELINE: TARPON SPRINGS



A judge has denied the city of Tarpon Springs the right to be reimbursed for
legal fees incurred while being sued by the foundation that operates Helen
Ellis Memorial Hospital.

In asking to be reimbursed, the city's brief said the Tarpon Springs  Hospital
Foundation started the lawsuit, so it should pay.

The city, which leases the hospital to the foundation, also says the lease
requires the foundation to pay the city for such expenses, the motion stated.

Pinellas County Circuit Judge Crockett Farnell declined to make such a  ruling
Thursday.

The lawsuit itself was brought to clarify issues about legal fees at a  trial.

The foundation sued to force the city to pay for legal fees incurred by the
hospital during the debate over whether the city should sell the hospital last
year.

The preparation for that case is under way.

CORRECTION:
 A headline in Saturday's Times incorrectly stated that Tarpon Springs had lost
a lawsuit over legal fees. The Health Facilities Authority, a city-appointed
board being sued by the foundation that operates Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital,
lost a motion asking to be reimbursed for legal fees incurred during the
lawsuit.
