ORGAN SCANDAL PARENTS COULD BE FACING LEGAL FIGHT

LENGTH: 265 words


PARENTS whose dead babies' organs were removed and stored without their
permission could be facing a legal fight.

But the court action will not affect the majority of Merseyside parents whose
children were caught up in the Alder Hey organs scandal.

Their legal fight was resolved in September 2002.

More than 1, 000 parents are fighting for compensation from the NHS after their
children's body parts were retained by hospitals across the UK.

The high court ruled last year that many hospitals had broken the law over organ
retention and offered families a total of £3. 3m in damages.

Now a row has broken out over the payment of legal fees which could mean
families are out of pocket after they have paid their legal costs.

Most parents have an average legal bill of £1, 618.

In an e-mail newsletter the Legal Services Commission, which funds legal aid,
warned families they may receive less than they first thought.

Solicitor Ian Cohen, who was involved in the legal fight following the Alder Hey
scandal, said: "The vast majority of parents from Merseyside involved in
litigation settled their case.

"A few joined a national group litigation and their case went to court in March
2004.

"It is these parents who are involved. "

Body parts from hundreds of dead children were retained at Alder Hey children's
hospital over several decades.

The Redfern Inquiry exposed Dutch pathologist Professor Dick van Velzen, who
lied to parents, forged research applications and ordered retention of every
organ. He will not face criminal prosecution.
