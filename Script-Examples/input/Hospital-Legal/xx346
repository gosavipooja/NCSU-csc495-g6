Battle to curb the legal aid millionaires

THE Lord Chancellor has renewed his attack on fat-cat lawyers by revealing that
barristers are becoming millionaires on the back of the legal aid system.

Many barristers earned nine times the salary of a hospital consultant last year
and some earned nearly five times the wages of a High Court judge from their
legal-aid work.

Lord Irvine's figures showed that 55 barristers were each paid between £203,000
and £575,000 from legal aid last year.

He told peers that 35 barristers received between £270,000 and £575,000 for
criminal work. Another 20 got between £203,000 and £411,000 for civil work, on
top of any fees earned from privately-paying clients.

The figures showed that almost 1,000 barristers earned more from legal aid last
year than hospital consultants are paid.

Signalling a bitter battle ahead with top lawyers in his bid to reform the legal
aid system, Lord Irvine said: "A High Court judge earns £112,011. A lord justice
of appeal earns £124,511. Many hospital consultants earn £56,000-£70,000 a year.
Judges and hospital consultants all work hard over long hours ... The lives of
many people depend on their professionalism. Yet almost 1,000 barristers earned
from legal aid last year more than hospital consultants are paid."

Lord Irvine, himself thought to earn between £500,000 and £1million a year,
pledged to curb barristers' legal aid fees.

He said he would concentrate savings on helping the poor and disadvantaged, and
paid tribute to the lawyers who acted for them.

"These are lawyers who do not become rich.

They act for refugees, asylum seekers, prisoners, mental patients, victims of
abuse and assault."

Lord Irvine plans to abolish legal aid for most money claims next year and
replace them with a no-win no-fee system, backed up by insurance, as part of his
sweeping reform of the legal aid system.

His comments came only months after he outraged senior lawyers by branding them
"fat cats" and warning that they were pricing the public out of the courts.
