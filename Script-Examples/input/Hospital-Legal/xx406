ROYAL Melbourne Hospital patients will have access to free legal advice in an
initiative involving a North Melbourne community legal firm.

The service combines the efforts of North Melbourne police, community legal
service lawyers and health practitioners. Georgina Hanna, a workforce
development manager at the hospital, said the initiative was designed to help
the vulnerable.

"We know that when people come to hospital, they tell us things in
confidentiality. They disclose things like legal issues, because we're trusted
health professionals," Ms Hanna said.A lawyer will provide free legal services
to patients at the hospital once a week.
