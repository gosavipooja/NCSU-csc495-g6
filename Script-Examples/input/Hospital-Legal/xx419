Medical tussle: Abuse victim fighting for life

LENGTH: 198  words


A woman assaulted by her husband early on Monday has failed to obtain a medico-
legal certificate from three government hospitals despite the passage of three
days since the incident.

Sarfaraz, a resident of Thathi Raju, had attacked Aziz Bibi, his wife, with an
axe on Monday. Bibi was taken to Sahiwal THQ Hospital after police had
registered a case. Aziz Bibi's brother said no staff was present at the
hospital. He said she had been taken to Sargodha DHQ Hospital later. Bibi's
brother said she had been taken to Allied Hospital after being treated at the
hospital. He said doctors from Allied Hospital had said that her condition was
critical. Bibi's brother said no medico-legal certificate had been issued by the
hospitals. Sahiwal THQ Hospital MS Qazi Amanullah said the certificate should
have been issued at the Sargodha DHQ Hospital. Sargodha DHQ Hospital In-charge
Naeem Sheikh said the certificate should have been issued at the Sahiwal THQ
Hospital. Sahiwal Investigation SI Amanullah said it was peculiar that the
hospitals were not facilitating the investigation. He said the victim was paying
the price for their negligence.
