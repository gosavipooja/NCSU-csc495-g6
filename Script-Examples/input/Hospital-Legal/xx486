HOSPITAL ACCIDENT 'LEFT MAN CRIPPLED'

BYLINE: Dale Williams

SECTION: Pg. 7

LENGTH: 244 words


A DUDLEY man claims he has been left crippled following an incident at a
hospital in which he was allegedly dropped by nurses.

Father-of-two Michael Sanders is embroiled in a legal battle for damages with
Dudley Hospitals NHS Trust.

The 56-year-old, of Westminster Close, said he was forced to use sticks to get
about and was in almost constant agony with back pain.

Mr Sanders, who has suffered from epileptic fits all his life, said the accident
happened about a year ago at Russells Hall Hospital.

He said: "My wife Sue took me to the hospital because I had started fitting.

"When I got there I was being held up by three nurses. I was standing and they
dropped me and I fell down, landing on a chair."

He said in the fall he suffered a fracture to the base of his spine and two
slipped discs.

Granted

He added: "I have been granted legal aid of about pounds 2,000 to fight the
case, but that is fast running out.

"What I really need is the funds to buy an electric wheelchair, but they are too
costly to afford at the moment."

Mr Sanders added: "I have been told by solicitors that this legal claim could
drag on for some time - about three years was the last estimate for it to be
resolved."

A spokesman for Dudley Hospitals confirmed that a claim against the trust had
been submitted by Mr Sanders.

"Because the case is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment. The matter is
in the hands of our solicitors."
