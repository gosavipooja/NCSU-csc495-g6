Council leader threatens Mid Staffs with 'inevitable' legal challenge

LENGTH: 241  words


Council leader Mike Heenan (Con) has consulted lawyers in a bid to prevent
Stafford Hospital from losing its consultant-led maternity department.


It would be the third legal challenge to changes at the troubled hospital since
the health secretary accepted the report of trust special administrators in
February.
This concluded the trust was clinically and financially unsustainable.
As part of his announcement to dissolve the trust, Jeremy Hunt recommended a
review of Â Stafford's consultant-led maternity service.
The hospital is due in November to be taken over by the University Hospital of
North Staffordshire, which has indicated it may close the department before the
review is complete.
Cllr Heenan said maternity services had always been the "red line".
"If the likelihood is that line has been crossed, it seems inevitable the
council will launch a legal challenge to fight any decision that does not
protect a full maternity service at Stafford."
He added: "The people of Stafford have indicated clearly that they do not
support the movement of consultant led maternity services to UHNS and
Wolverhampton.
"I immediately consulted our solicitors with a view to pursuing a legal
challenge.
"We must take their advice on the timing and type of action this would mean as
my only aim is to ensure we protect a full maternity service at Stafford
Hospital, and to do that we need the proper and professional legal advice."
