Records lost by hospital may stop mum suing

A MOTHER-OF-THREE may be forced to halt her legal action against the hospital
that saved her life after they admitted losing some of her medical records.

Kathleen Booth, of Shepherd Street, Biddulph, had intended to sue North
Staffordshire Hospital for medical negligence.

In 1996 she almost died after giving birth to her third son George at the
hospital.

She had a caesarean section, her heart stopped twice and she needed 10 pints of
blood during her ordeal. In 1998 she had several operations to repair a hernia.

Mrs Booth, aged 40, started legal action over her care at the hospital late in
1998.

But it may have to be halted after the hospital admitted some of her intensive
care observation charts had been "irretrievably lost".

Without the vital records Mrs Booth's claim for compensation may go no further
and Mrs Booth has asked her MP Charlotte Atkins to look into the blunder on her
behalf.

She said: "I am disgusted that the hospital has lost my records. I have got to
have more surgery and I am scared that what is in my lost medical records may be
something this surgeon needs to know. I am taking legal action and then my notes
go missing. How many other people's records have they lost?"

Her solicitor Chris Murphy said: "It is very disturbing that medical records
like this can go missing."

A spokesman for the North Staffordshire Hospital said: "We can confirm that
Kathleen Booth is taking legal action, but because of this we are unable to
comment any further."
