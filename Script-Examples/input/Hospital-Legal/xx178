Tax-Exempt Status For Nonprofit Hospitals Under The ACA: Where Are The Final
Treasury/IRS Rules

LENGTH: 1664  words


Months have now stretched into years, and there still remains no sign of final
Treasury/IRS regulations interpreting the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s provisions
covering the expanded obligations of nonprofit hospitals that seek tax-exempt
status under §501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.


The ACA amendments do not depend on formal agency policy to take effect.
Nonetheless, Congress directed the Treasury Secretary to issue regulations and
guidance necessary to carry out the reforms (26 U.S.C. §501(r)(7)). To this end,
two important sets of proposed rules were issued: the first in June, 2012; and
the second, in April 2013. While an informative IRS website lists various
proposed rules and guidelines important to nonprofit hospitals, final rules seem
to have performed a disappearing act.
Apparently recognizing the problems created by its delays, the agency has gone
so far as to issue a special Notice letting nonprofit hospitals (and presumably
the public) know that they can rely on its proposed rules. But this assurance
overlooks the fact that the proposed rules themselves contained crucial areas in
which final agency policy has not yet been adopted.
The ACA Reforms
Section 9007 of the ACA added a new §501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code,
establishing a set of expanded obligations as a condition of federal tax-exempt
status. The Hilltop Institute, which tracks state activities around hospital
community benefit, reports that many states link their own tax-exempt policies
to satisfaction of federal tax-exempt requirements.
The ACA's expanded obligations span a number of important areas: community
health planning; financial assistance for patients; and hospitals' billing and
collection practices.
Community Health Needs Assessment
The ACA requires hospitals to conduct a community health needs assessment
(CHNA). This requirement took effect in 2012; it consists not only of planning
with broad community and public health input but also adoption of an
Implementation Strategy detailing how the hospital's community benefit
investment will meet the needs identified in the CHNA (26 U.S.C. §501(r)(3)).
Following the issuance of preliminary 2011 guidance , the IRS issued a proposed
rule in 2013, 77 Fed. Reg. 20523 (April 5, 2013) outlining a relatively robust
CHNA process, even as it left certain aspects of its CHNA policy less than fully
defined. Critical issues that remain outstanding include how hospitals define
"community," and whether the all-important Implementation Strategy component of
the CHNA process -- essentially a hospital organization's community benefit
investment blueprint -- must itself be made available for public comment prior
to board adoption.  Finalizing these regulatory policies is critical. The
National Network of Public Health Institutes undertook a project funded by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose purpose was to test the
feasibility of an online tool to support community health planning. Its findings
suggest that hospitals vary widely in how they define the pivotal concept of
"community" in relation to their planning obligations. The report found, for
example, that despite the proposed rules' emphasis on geographic community
definitions that did not discriminate against medically underserved populations
at risk for health disparities, only 23 percent of surveyed CHNAs expressly took
geographic health disparities into account in defining the community to be
served.
Financial Assistance/Billing and Collection Practices
The ACA reformed the procedures and standards applicable to tax-exempt hospital
financial assistance programs, historically a core activity of tax-exempt
hospitals, and one that takes on special importance in states that, to date,
have failed to implement the Medicaid adult expansion. The ACA amendments (26
U.S.C. §501(r)(4)(A)) make several key reforms: they limit the charges that can
be leveled against patients eligible for financial assistance; they require
hospitals to establish written policies specifying financial eligibility
criteria, how patients can qualify for assistance, and hospital collection
practices in the event of non-payment; and they require that policies be "widely
publicize[d] within the community served by the organization."
The amendments also require written policies clarifying hospital compliance with
Medicare Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requirements
regarding emergency medical care. On June 22 2012, the IRS issued a proposed (77
Fed. Reg. 38148) rule implementing the requirements. Nearly two and a half years
later, no final rule has been issued.
The statutory requirements are in effect, of course. On August 25th, public
interest lawyers representing affected residents in Miami filed a first-of-its
kind administrative claim with the IRS against Jackson Health System, alleging
failure to comply with the ACA's financial assistance and CHNA requirements.
Relying on the proposed rules and the statute itself, lawyers from Florida Legal
Services and the National Health Law Program allege that Jackson Health System's
failure to comply with the ACA has the potential to affect at least 165,000
indigent Miami-Dade County residents deprived of coverage as a result of
Florida's refusal to adopt the adult Medicaid expansion.
The implications flowing from the denial of Medicaid coverage are, of course,
enormous for hospitals such as Jackson Health System, which play an absolutely
essential role in the lives of their disadvantaged community residents. At the
same time, the ACA makes clear that a hospital's status as tax-exempt is to be
tied to an increased level of transparency and community accountability -- in
community health improvement planning, in billing and collection practices used,
in adherence to EMTALA, and in maintaining financial assistance programs that
are fair and accessible. Legal challenges such as the Miami case, especially in
the Medicaid opt-out states -- where financial assistance is of the utmost
importance -- can be expected to grow, and thus the imperative for final
Treasury rules increases.
A Community Health Improvement Dividend from the Affordable Care Act?
The most authoritative study to date estimates that hospitals apply less than 1
percent of their overall expenditures to community health improvement
activities. Furthermore, the IRS defines community health improvement to include
not only actual health interventions but also hospitals' own health planning
costs and costs associated with hospital fund-raising activities. There is no
way of knowing just how much hospitals actually spend on community health
improvement.
Nonetheless in recent years there have been numerous examples of hospital
efforts to make community investments that can improve population health. As we
pointed out in an earlier Health Affairs Blog post, the Affordable Care Act
creates the potential for the modest 1 percent figure to rise as a result of
increasing insurance coverage, especially in the Medicaid expansion states. With
increased insurance should come a decline in the need for financial assistance
for the uninsured. Indeed, early evidence suggests that gains in coverage are
likely to have a salutary effect on hospitals' bottom lines, as they realize
gains in both patients and revenues.
It may seem strange, given the administrative complaint noted above, to focus on
investments in legal supports for patients as an area of community health
improvement. But this may be one of the most promising opportunities for
hospital community investment programs, given the impact of legal barriers in
areas such as housing, economic, environmental, and nutritional assistance on
patient health. A striking example of an alliance between hospitals and lawyers
to improve community health can be found in "medical-legal partnership (MLP)"
programs -- that is, programs under which hospitals integrate civil legal aid
lawyers who specialize in resolving legal problems linked to the social
conditions of health.
Pioneered by Boston Medical Center and now in operation in 135 hospitals and 127
community health centers around the country, the MLP movement offers the
potential to bring legal expertise to bear on the underlying conditions of poor
health among patients, both addressing and preventing such problems as
substandard housing, domestic violence, food insecurity, environmental risks,
unemployment, and poverty. The program, which is a response to a documented high
level of legal need among the poor, has attracted national attention for its
efforts to alleviate social conditions that affect health.
Examples of hospitals that have built support for MLP into their community
benefit activities can be found at Seattle Children's Hospital, Boston
Children's Hospital, and Southern Illinois Healthcare (SIH) System. Beyond
improving community health, SIH in particular has demonstrated significant
return on investment (ROI) through its medical-legal partnership. MLP activities
fall squarely within the definition of community activities that have the
potential to improve community health while addressing key cost drivers.
Going Forward
Whatever the reason for the delay in the Treasury/IRS regulations, it is evident
that this major policy advance deserves to be rapidly formalized in final
implementing policy. After all, the heavy lifting -- proposed rules -- has
happened. As the IRS has made clear by its own signal to the public to rely on
the proposed rules, hospitals (and presumably all of us) can rely on the
proposed rules in moving forward. Yet critical issues await resolution.
Certainly some of the regulatory decisions raise complex implementation issues,
but the ACA's reforms in the areas of financial assistance, transparency, and
community health improvement planning (including identifying need and creating
and updating spending blueprints) are relatively straightforward. The statute
has taken effect, but the a 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.
