NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Maternity-Bed Persists

Despite low occupancy rates at Harlem's maternity units and a recent legal
setback, two civil rights organizations are continuing their battle to restore a
full ward at St. Luke's-Roosevel Hospital, at 114th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

Part of the unit, which in 1991 was supposed to be moved to 59th Street as part
of an overall merger of St. Luke's and Roosevelt, was kept at 114th Street after
protests that Harlem could not afford to lose the beds.

The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Educationa Fund and the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund, which recently lost an appeal to contest the matter on civil rights
grounds, are now taking their complaint to Federal health authorities.

They insist that the shift of beds unfairly deprive poor neighborhoods of vital
services.

But it is not clear how strong an argument the groups can make. Occupancy
figures at St. Luke's show that from April to December 1993, the 22 beds had an
occupancy rate of only 59.5 percent. The hospital said that half those patients
came from outside the Harlem area.

And maternity occupancy rates compiled by the State Department of Health showed
a sharp decrease at Harlem Hospital Center, dropping from 73.2 percent in 1990
to 54.2 percent in the first nine months of 1993.
