DATELINE: TORONTO


he Orthopedic and Arthritic Hospital has suspended its legal challenge of a
closure order issued by the Health Services Restructuring Commission.

The hospital is following the lead of Women's College Hospital, which dropped
its legal action in favour of negotiations last week.

The two hospitals, along with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, have been
ordered to merge under the umbrella of the Bayview Hospital Corp.

Both have received clarification from the commission that they may remain as
public hospitals with control over their speciality programs, albeit under the
Bayview umbrella.

Both hospitals say if negotiations are not successful, they will resume court
action.

Two other Toronto hospitals -- Doctors and Wellesley-Central -- completed their
submissions last Friday. The court has reserved decision.

The Health Services Restructuring Commission -- a group of doctors, academic
health-science professionals, hospital administrators, former hospital board
members and other experts, were appointed by the province to redesign Ontario's
health system.
