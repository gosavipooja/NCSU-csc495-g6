After the killing of a medico-legal officer (MLO), Dr Manzoor Ahmed Memon,
leading public hospitals in the city are facing shortage of medico-legal
officers (MLOs), The Nation has learned.

The murder of MLO Dr Manzoor Ahmed Memon has forced MLOs of other hospitals to
go on vacations.

Three major public hospitals of the city, Jinnah Postgraduate and Medical Centre
(JPMC), Civil Hospital, Karachi, and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital are facing the
shortage of MLOs.

According to reports, as many as five MLOs were deputed in the JPMC before the
killing of Dr Manzoor Ahmed Memon, only three MLOs are left for postpartum
service and others.

On the other hand, only five MLOs of 17 grades are working in the Civil
Hospital, while only six MLOs are engaged at Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.

The medico-legal officers of Jinnah Postgraduate and Medical Centre (JPMC),
Civil Hospital, Karachi, and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital have staged a protest to
denounce the killing of their colleague.

A senior doctor of JPMC, declined to be named, said that MLOs fear Dr Memon
ending.

He said that MLOs often receive threats from miscreants but the government does
not insure their security.

PMA Karachi General Secretary Dr M Qazi Wasiq told The Nation that the medical
fraternity was under great security threat while many doctors have been killed
in the current year only.
