McMaster hospital helping families get legal aid

McMaster Children's hospital is helping the families of patients get free legal
help.

More than 30 families have already used the service announced Thursday at the
hospital on Main Street West.

McMaster partnered in November with Pro Bono Law Ontario, which already runs
similar programs in all of Ontario's other children's hospitals.

PBLO provides a triage lawyer twice a week at Chedoke and McMaster to assess the
severity of a family's issue, provide advice and train clinicians on how to spot
families with legal issues.

Families who need help are referred to the Hamilton Legal Clinic and local firms
Gowling Lafleur Henderson and Ross and McBride.

Some of the legal issues stem from the financial stress of having an ill child,
such as eviction or denial of disability benefits.

Others involve the fallout of caring for a sick kid such as problems getting
time off work, marriage breakdown or immigration hurdles in having a relative
from another country come to help out.

Sometimes it's accommodating a sick child, such as negotiating absences from
school, special education supports or proper housing.

PBLO has long wanted to add McMaster, but did not have the funding until it got
a $50,000 grant from the Atkinson Foundation.

It hopes to keep the program running with donations after the funding runs out.
