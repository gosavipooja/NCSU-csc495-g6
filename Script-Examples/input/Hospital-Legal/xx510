MUM HAD TO BURY CHILD THREE TIMES

LENGTH: 224 words


A mother told yesterday how she had to bury her daughter three times as parents
began legal action against a fifth hospital over missing body organs.

Noreen Hodgkinson, whose daughter Noleen aged 16 months died nine years ago
today after a failed heart operation, said she felt "betrayed".

Yesterday 30 families started legal action against Birmingham Children's
Hospital for unlawfully removing and retaining organs without proper consent.

The hospital has already admitted taking and storing up to 1,500 children's
hearts without full consent and knowledge of parents. But families have learned
other organs were also taken.

Similar situations have been exposed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Alder Hey,
Liverpool, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow and at the Royal Sick
Children's Hospital, Edinburgh. Mrs Hodgkinson, from Stafford, said: "I have had
to bury my daughter's body three times after learning more body parts were taken
than was originally admitted."

Val Clifford, from Aldridge, West Midlands, only discovered 30 years later that
the hospital had taken organs from her son Raymond, who died when he was a few
days old. "No one deserves for this to happen to them," she said."Birmingham
Children's Hospital believes legal action ahead of the Chief Medical Officer's
report to be premature.
