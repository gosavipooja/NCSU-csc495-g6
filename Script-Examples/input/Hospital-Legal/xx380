LEGAL NOTICE
Public Announcement Concerning the Establishment of a Satellite Emergency
Facility by Hallmark Health System, Inc. - Lawrence Memorial Hospital
Hallmark Health System, Inc.

(the "Applicant"), which owns and operates Lawrence Memorial Hospital, filed an
application with the Department of Public Health on or about July 28, 2017 to
establish a Satellite Emergency Facility (the "Facility"). The Facility will be
known as "Lawrence Memorial Hospital Satellite Emergency Facility" and will be
located in the space currently occupied by the Applicant's existing Emergency
Department at 170 Governors Avenue, Medford, MA 02155. The Applicant proposes to
establish this Facility because the Medical-Surgical and Intensive Care Unit
services are being relocated to the Applicant's other hospital campus,
Melrose-Wakefield Hospital. However, emergency and other medical care at
Lawrence Memorial Hospital will continue to be provided at the site. The
proposed Facility will provide a wide range of emergency, urgent care, and
non-urgent care services to the patient population and will be staffed and
operate twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. Medical care at the
Facility will include assessments of patients of all ages, stabilizations,
diagnostic studies, consultations, and determinations of follow-up care. The
Applicant will hold a public meeting regarding the proposed Facility, which will
take place at 6:00pm on Thursday, September 7, 2017 at Lawrence Memorial/Regis
School of Nursing, 170 Governors Avenue, Medford, MA 02155, Classroom A/B.
