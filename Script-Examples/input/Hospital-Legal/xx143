Man awarded $300,000 after failed suicide leap A MAN who leapt out of a hospital
window in an attempt to commit suicide won a $300,000 payout from the hospital
yesterday.

Mr Peter Reardon, 21, who was left a permanent paraplegic by the fall, sued the
Royal Melbourne Hospital for failing to stop him jumping.

The hospital agreed to the damages payout in an out-of-court settlement.

But experts consider the case sets a legal landmark.

The traditional legal view has been that defendants cannot be held liable for
failing to protect people from themselves.

Mr Reardon took the hospital to the Victorian Supreme Court, claiming hospital
staff were negligent in leaving him unattended when they knew he was suicidal.

In agreeing to the damages, the hospital said the payout was made with a denial
of liability.

Mr Ross Gillies, QC, for Mr Reardon, told a jury earlier that the young man was
admitted as suicidal and depressed only an hour before the suicide attempt.

He had a history of suicide attempts and psychiatric illness.

Mr Reardon had been left alone, and while he was hallucinating and shaking, he
caught a lift and jumped from a window, believed to have been on at least the
sixth floor, he said.

He had crashed on to the roof of the hospital's cafeteria, shattering his spine,
and was now a permanent paraplegic, Mr Gillies said.

He told the jury the hospital's failure to keep Mr Reardon under observation was
negligent, and amounted to a failure to fulfil its legal obligation to Mr
Reardon.

Mr Paul Henderson, of the legal firm, Slater and Gordon, said Mr Reardon was
happy with the payout, but did not wish to comment further.
