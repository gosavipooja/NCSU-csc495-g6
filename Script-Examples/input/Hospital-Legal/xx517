FORMER Tonna rugby player Paul Bamsey is taking legal action against Neath
General Hospital over an alleged blunder which ruined his sporting dreams.

The 26-year-old from Tonna, Neath, says a drill bit was left behind after
surgery on his broken leg.

He snapped his left leg during a match four years ago.

Doctors drilled a metal plate into his leg during an operation but the drill bit
snapped during the operation at Neath General Hospital.

An X-ray showed up the inch-long broken bit and Paul now plans legal action
against the hospital.

Carpenter Paul said: "I've been through four years of aggro from my leg. It just
wouldn't heal. I've had to give up rugby, and had half-a-dozen other operations.

Paul, of Heol Dyddwr, Tonna, is launching legal action against Neath General
Hospital. He was playing for Tonna and had hopes of a promising career.But
Paul's dreams were dashed - as he watched his former schoolboy team-mates all
play for Wales.

Independent consultant Donald Mc Neill said: "Drill bits do not normally break."

Malcolm Otter, associate director at the hospital, said: "I can confirm Mr
Bamsey has made a legal claim against us."
