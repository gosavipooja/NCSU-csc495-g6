At least 20 legal claims have been initiated against Scottish hospitals over the
removal of children's organs without consent. Many NHS trusts have already
received notification from lawyers that claims are proceeding against them.

Just six months after it was revealed that 6000 organs and tissue samples were
retained without consent in Scottish hospitals, trusts are preparing to be sued
for damages.

Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow has nine legal cases pending while Lothian
University Hospital in Edinburgh, which runs the city's Sick Children's
Hospital, has been notified of six claims.

North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust and Tayside University Hospitals
NHS Trust each have two legal cases in progress against them in relation to
organ retention.  Last night one of the solicitors acting for the bereaved
families insisted, however, that parents are more interested in securing an
apology than financial recompense.

Lanarkshire solicitor Angela McCredie said: "The motive is not financial. It is
more a case of the parents being really upset by the way they have been treated
by the hospital. They almost want to make the hospital admit that they were
wrong.

"It is the only way you can do it. If you want to make someone pay for what they
have done you have got to take out a legal action for damages."
