'MISTAKE' IN STUDY OF MMR

LENGTH: 150 words


FRESH doubts were last night cast on a study which linked the MMR vaccine with
autism.

It has been claimed the report which first highlighted the fears should not have
been published.

The study linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism appeared in
medical journal The Lancet six years ago.

But editor Richard Horton says he would not have printed it if he had known
author Dr Andrew Wakefield was conducting studies for both the Royal Free
Hospital and the Legal Aid Board.

He said there was a conflict of interest.

Mr Horton added: "I do believe there was validity to the connection between
bowel disease and autism, but I believe the MMR element of that is invalid."

He added: "As the father of a three-year-old who's had MMR, I regret hugely the
adverse impact this paper has had."

The study led to a reduced take-up of MMR, which continues today.
