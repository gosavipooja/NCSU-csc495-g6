HIGHLIGHT:Â Medical device firm TriVascular Technologies has obtained approval
from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Ovation iX Abdominal
Stent Graft System.


The new system features built-in procedural option that can be used to replace
retrograde cannulation of the main body device, allowing to place the
contralateral iliac stent graft.



It also features low profile 12-13F integrated sheath, which is designed to
minimize vessel trauma and reduce procedural steps.

TriVascular Technologies CEO and president Christopher Chavez said: "The launch
of the complete Ovation iX system supports our mission to improve and safely
expand EVAR for all and serves as evidence of our commitment to deliver a strong
pipeline of products.

"We believe the Ovation iX delivery system enhancements will complement the
broad IFU of the Ovation system and further enable our physician partners to
provide improved, on-label EVAR treatment to more patients."

TriVascular distributes Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft platform in around 35
countries.
