Distracted nurses make mistakes

A MAJOR study of how medicines are administered in Australian hospitals has
found a high rate of ``procedural failure and clinical error'' by nurses.

Nurses made at least one error or oversight in 80.2 per cent of cases in which
they gave a drug or other treatment to a patient.

The mistakes ranged from forgetting to wash their hands or not reconfirming a
patient's identity through to administering the wrong drug dose, and in some
cases the oversight was life-threatening.

Professor Johanna Westbrook said nurses faced a multitude of competing demands
while in a hospital ward, and the more they were interrupted the more mistakes
they made.

``In 80 per cent of administrations of medication there was at least one
procedural failure or one clinical error,'' said Prof Westbrook, from the
University of Sydney's Health Informatics Research and Evaluation Unit.

``What we showed is that if you were interrupted you we more likely to make one
of those errors.''

Prof Westbrook and her colleagues tracked almost 100 nurses based at two unnamed
Australian hospitals over about two years.
