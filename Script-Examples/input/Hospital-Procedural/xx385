Systems' (SIS) Perioperative IT technology for improved patient care and
procedural efficiency.


Abington Health in Philadelphia, US, has chosen Surgical Information Systems'
(SIS) perioperative IT technology for improved patient care and procedural
efficiency.

The two-hospital health system will leverage the technology for optimising
operating room (OR) performance.

Abington nurse director of informatics Diane Humbrecht said the technology will
improve access to patient information at the point of care and increase the
efficiency of the OR.

"It gives us the ability to track important data from the OR; automate our
patient tracking to improve accuracy and efficiency; and fully integrate
information from the OR with our Allscripts enterprise record," Humbrecht added.

The SIS solution will implement a single perioperative record that includes
modules for surgery scheduling, including pre-admission testing (PAT) and
resource scheduling, nursing and anaesthesia documentation, rules-based bill
charging, advanced analytics, and patient tracking and communications.

The platform incorporates the AORN SYNTEGRITY Framework, which provides clinical
content that complements the SIS nursing documentation system with the
Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) third edition and standardised
documentation fields that guide patient-centred care, according to SIS.

SIS CEO Ed Daihl said the technology will help Abington in offering pertinent
information to regulatory bodies that monitor hospital quality and cost.

"The use of easily visible and highly integrated patient data within the OR
environment reduces costs and streamlines regulatory reporting," Daihl added.
