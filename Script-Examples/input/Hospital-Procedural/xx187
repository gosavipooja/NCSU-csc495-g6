New Zealand's health system would be a lot easier to run if it did as the
Burwood Hospital Spinal Injuries Unit has done, says Health Minister Bill
English.

Mr English said the unit had provided real leadership'' by becoming the first
acute unit to gain an internationally recognised industrial qualification such
as ISO 9000 accreditation.

The spinal unit, which Mr English visited yesterday, had provided proof that
complex medical units can provide set performance standards by getting the ISO
9000 accreditation.

The way Burwood codified its procedures had big implications for other health
service providers, he said.

A big issue is how do you know that a hospital is running properly?''

In the absence of set performance and procedural standards it was often hard to
tell how well hospitals were performing. Controversy and criticism of aspects of
other health services had been able to flourish because there often were no set
standards for evaluating circumstances.

Across the health services the attention given to this issue has been patchy,''
Mr English said.

Recent investigations into patient safety at Christchurch Hospital would have
been simpler if similar detailed procedural guidelines had been available.
