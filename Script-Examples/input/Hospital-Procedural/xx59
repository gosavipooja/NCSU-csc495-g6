HIGHLIGHT:Â Rural doc debate heats up


RURAL Doctors Association of Queensland president Dr Dan Halliday has thanked
the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners for its contribution to
community discussion about training doctors for rural communities.

The RACGP's Position Statement on Rural General Practice, released last week,
raised concerns with Queensland Health's Rural Generalist Training Program. The
RGTP has been widely praised by country doctors nationwide for teaching
much-needed procedural skills and providing a well-paid training and career path
in Queensland's country hospitals, and the model may be adopted by other states.

"RDAQ members agree with RACGP that doctors becoming qualified for general
practice cannot be trained solely in hospitals," Dr Halliday said. "RDAQ
acknowledges RACGP's concerns that a two-tiered remuneration structure might
develop. Procedural hospital doctors that have advanced skills and work for
Queensland Health could be better rewarded than their office-based general
practitioner colleagues who are funded through Medicare and often self-employed.

"Our members see this challenge as a call to seek better remuneration through
Medicare rebates for rural doctors in the private sector. RDAQ invites the RACGP
to join us, and the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, in lobbying the
Federal Government to level that particular playing field."
