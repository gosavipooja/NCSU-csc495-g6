Mortality for Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction

LENGTH: 152  words

DATELINE: Washington


American College of Cardiology Foundation has issued the following news release:

Public reporting of procedural outcomes may create disincentives to provide
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for critically ill patients.

Objectives  This study evaluated the association between public reporting with
procedural management and outcomes among patients with acute myocardial
infarction (AMI).

Methods  Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified all patients with
a primary diagnosis of AMI in states with public reporting (Massachusetts and
New York) and regionally comparable states without public reporting
(Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) between
2005 and 2011. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were stratified by
public reporting.
