Double incentives

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 93  words


The Commonwealth Government will double the incentive payments to rural
procedural GPs in further recognition of their additional skills and
responsibilities.

From February, rural procedural GPs will be entitled to claim up to $15,000 per
year under the government's Practice Incentives Program.

This boost will provide further support to GPs who provide surgical, anaesthetic
and obstetric services to rural and remote communities.

This is an important measure for rural communities relying on experienced
general practitioners to keep local hospitals running.
