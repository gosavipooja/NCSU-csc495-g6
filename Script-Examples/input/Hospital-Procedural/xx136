New threat in hospital dispute SYDNEY._ New South Wales surgical specialists
last night indicated they might stop manning crisis treatment centres. The
centres are filling gaps in the hospital system during the Medicare dispute
between the NSW Government and doctors. The Council of Procedural Specialists'
deputy chairman, Dr Michael Aroney, said the NSW Premier, Mr Wran, had said the
Health Department was managing. But this was only because surgeons were manning
the crisis centres, which were handling emergency operations at major hospitals.
