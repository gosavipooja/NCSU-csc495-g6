Involuntary Civil Commitment

Sexually Violent Predators -- Due Process Bailey v. Pataki 10-2563 Judges
McLaughlin, Sack and Hall

Background: The defendants appealed from an order denying their motion for
summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs' section 1983 procedural due process
claims. The defendants argued they were entitled to qualified immunity as, even
if the civil commitment proceedings against the plaintiffs failed to comply with
procedural due process, no reasonable person in the defendants' position would
have known that he was violating the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Ruling:
The Second Circuit affirmed. The court found that the plaintiffs' commitments
were effected not through the state's normal civil commitment procedures, but by
means of an executive-branch effort aimed at preventing the release of sexually
violent predators. New York state's governor had directed the Office of Mental
Health and the Department of Correctional Services to develop a plan to
involuntarily commit selected SVPs to state psychiatric facilities. Ameer Benno
