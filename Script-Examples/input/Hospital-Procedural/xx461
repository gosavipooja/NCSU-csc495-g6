A JUDGE has reserved a decision on the scientific scandal at the University of
NSW, which is prevented by a temporary injunction from releasing the report of
an inquiry into accusations against scientist Bruce Hall.

In the NSW Supreme Court, Justice David McClellan said he would rule no later
than August 25 on an application by accused medical scientist Hall to quash and
permanently suppress the report and its findings on allegations against him.
Professor Hall, a transplant specialist who works for UNSW and Sydney's
Liverpool Hospital, has been accused by two other scientists he supervised at
the hospital of scientific misconduct and scientific fraud. He has denied the
allegations.

Justice McClellan has to decide whether Professor Hall was denied procedural
fairness by the way the inquiry was run, as Professor Hall claims happened, and
whether his court has the power to make a permanent order in a university
disciplinary case.

The report of the external inquiry, which was headed by former High Court chief
justice Gerard Brennan, has been suppressed by temporary court injunction since
February, just as the university was due to release the report to the NSW and
federal governments and the complainants against Professor Hall.

The university denies the external inquiry lacked procedural fairness. Justice
Brennan has not commented publicly.

Counsel for UNSW and Professor Hall ended their arguments unexpectedly early
last Wednesday, on the fourth day of hearings, which began in early July.
