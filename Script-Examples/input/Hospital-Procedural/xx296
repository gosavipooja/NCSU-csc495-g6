Surgeons vote "no' SYDNEY._ Rebel surgeons in New South Wales plan to return to
the public hospital system to perform elective surgery on the disadvantaged and
pensioners at no cost.

A Council of Procedural Specialists spokesman, Dr David McNicoll, said yesterday
the council's executive would announce details of the plan in the next few days.

Dr McNicoll said the plan followed the overwhelming rejection yesterday of the
Federal Government's $166 million ""peace package" of changes to Medicare.

The 470 surgeons at a meeting at the University of New South Wales were asked to
complete a questionnaire with three options _ withdrawing their resignations and
going back to work; continuing with their resignations but providing normal
services in hospitals pending further negotiations; or continuing with their
resignations and performing only emergency surgery, as now.
