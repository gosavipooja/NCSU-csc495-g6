TNT has ordered David E. Kelley's hospital drama "Monday Mornings" to series.

Show, produced by the Atlanta-based cabler and formerly titled "Chelsea
General," stars Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina and Jamie Bamber. Kelley and CNN
medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, on whose book the show is based, will
exec produce.

Show is the first Kelley is doing outside his production deal at Warner Bros.
Television that recently ended. His NBC legal drama "Harry's Law," whose cast
and crew are anxiously awaiting word on whether it will return next season, is
through WBTV. Kelley shot a "Wonder Woman" pilot last year for NBC that didn't
make it to air.

Set at a fictional hospital in Portland, Ore., "Monday Mornings" follows the
lives of doctors as they push the limits of their abilities and confront their
personal and professional failings.

As for other pilots that TNT is considering for a series greenlight, there won't
be a decision made before next week's Gotham upfront on either Carol
Mendelsohn's procedural "Scent of the Missing" or the serialized "L.A. Noir,"
from creator Frank Darabont. Production for the "L.A. Noir" pilot is under way.

TNT will likely shoot more procedural pilots before choosing which one to put on
the air.
