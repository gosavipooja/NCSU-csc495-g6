New Study Finds Pediatric ACL Reconstruction More Efficient in Outpatient
Setting

LENGTH: 125  words


Aug. 1 -- In a study published in the journal Orthopedics, researchers compared
ACL reconstructions performed on pediatric patients in hospital and outpatient
surgery center settings. The study analyzed procedural efficiency by looking at
total OR time, total staff and support staff changes. Minimizing potential
variation, the same institution owned and operated both facilities and the
surgeries were performed by the same surgeon.

Of the 49 total procedures involved in the study, the researchers concluded, "
Procedural efficiency was greater at the [outpatient surgery center] compared
with the hospital. The provision of consistent and experienced
orthopedic-specific teams allows for improvement in OR efficiency, cost, and
value."
