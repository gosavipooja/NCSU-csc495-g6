The family of a premature baby born in Brisbane will be allowed to stay in
Australia for the time being after the federal government agreed to ensure they
would receive "a fair process" before any decision was made to return them to
Nauru.

Baby Ferouz made headlines earlier this month when Fairfax Media revealed he was
being kept in Brisbane's Mater Hospital alone, while his mother Latifar was
locked up for 18 hours a day in detention.

Maurice Blackburn Lawyers took up the case and demanded the government grant the
family "procedural fairness" before deciding whether to return Ferouz, Latifar,
her husband and two older children back to offshore detention.

Federal Circuit Court Judge Margaret Cassidy recognised the deal in Brisbane on
Friday.

The legal firm's spokesman, Murray Watt, said: "We believe we've reached
agreement that the family will receive procedural fairness or a fair process in
any decision to remove them to Nauru. That is all we have ever asked for. In the
meantime the family will remain in detention in Australia."

Procedural fairness means the family will have access to any information the
Immigration Department relies on - such as medical clearance - in deciding to
return the family.
