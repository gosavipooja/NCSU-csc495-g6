Doctors seek end

to free hospitals

]TWO key doctors' organisations have called for an end to universal

access to free hospitals.

The Council of Procedural Specialists and the Australian

Association of Surgeons made the call in submissions to a Senate

inquiry into private health insurance.

The inquiry is assessing legislative changes made a year ago to

encourage more people to take out private health insurance.

Council of Procedural Specialists chairman Donald Sheldon said free

access to public hospitals created ""overwhelming disincentives"

against taking out private health insurance.

""The majority of the population is financially able to afford

private health insurance as was demonstrated prior to the introduction

of Medicare," Dr Sheldon wrote in his submission.

""Thirteen years of Medicare has created major and incurable

problems in our health system.

""Major reforms are required to restore equity and access to our

hospital system."

The Australian Association of Surgeons' submission said the

community could no longer afford free hospitals for people who were

able to pay for their own hospital care.

""Such people displace the poor who have no other alternative,"

the submission said.

It also said only pensioners and other health care card holders

should have access to bulk billing, whereby people who visit their

doctors for free and doctors claim the fees from Medicare.
