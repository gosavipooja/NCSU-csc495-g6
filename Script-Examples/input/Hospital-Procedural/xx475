Minnesota Supreme Court: In re UnitedHealth Group Inc. Shareholder Derivative
Litigation

BYLINE: Minnesota Lawyer Staff Reporter

LENGTH: 237  words


Special Litigation Committee

1.     Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure 23.09, which provides that a derivative
suit "shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court,"
is a procedural rule and therefore cannot be applied by a federal court
exercising supplemental jurisdiction over claims asserted under state law.

2.     A state court addressing a certified question of state law is an improper
forum in which to address the proper interpretation of federal procedural rules.



3.     The Minnesota business judgment rule requires a reviewing court to defer
to a special litigation committee's (SLC) decision to settle a shareholder
derivative action if the proponent of that decision demonstrates that (1) the
members of the committee possessed a disinterested independence and (2) the
committee's investigative procedures and methodologies were adequate,
appropriate, and pursued in good faith.

Certified question answered.

Concurring, Anderson, Paul H., J. "I believe that the Minnesota business
judgment rule requires a court to consider the reasonableness of an SLC's
recommendation as well as the SLC's independence, investigative methods, and
good faith . . . . "
