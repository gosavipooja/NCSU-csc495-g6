Doctors to chew over peace bid SYDNEY._ The Council of Procedural Specialists
says it has prepared a point-by-point analysis of the Federal Government's plan
for ending the long-running New South Wales doctors' dispute. Its spokesman, Dr
Michael Aroney, said yesterday that the document would be presented to a special
meeting of surgeons at the University of NSW this morning. It will be publicly
released after the meeting. ""The document is set out in three columns: what we
want, what we were offered and what we received under the Australian Medical
Association peace package," he said. Dr Aroney said concrete resolutions would
probably emerge from a further meeting of surgeons within the next two weeks. He
said surgeons had not been advised of the full details of the peace package
released by the Federal Health Minister, Dr Blewett, on April 2. The Council of
Procedural Specialists had seen merely a ""skeletal" outline of the package. But
Dr Aroney made it clear that even in bare outline, the settlement proposals
would be unacceptable to the 2500 surgeons who had already resigned from NSW
public hospitals.
