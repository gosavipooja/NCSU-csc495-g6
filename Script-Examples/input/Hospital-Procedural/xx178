Inquiry nurses return to ward

LENGTH: 236 words


TWO male nurses suspended from their duties at Cefn Coed Hospital in June are
back on their wards following a three-week-long investigation.

Allegations of inappropriate behaviour were made against the fully qualified
nurses by a patient's family.

It has since emerged that the two men have been disciplined for a procedural
matter.

But the matter, which has not been made public by Swansea NHS Trust, was not a
grounds for dismissal, according to a trust spokesman.

Unison branch secretary Pat Dwan, who works at Cefn Coed psychiatric hospital,
this morning assured the public that patients were safe in the care of nurses
there.

He represented the men during the internal investigation.

The inquiry had left no stone unturned, he said.

"The two nurses were disciplined for a procedural matter which was incorrect and
I am sure they will not repeat the mistake again, he said.

"The investigation did not prove the allegations made against them and the
public can rest assured that patients are in safe hands at Cefn Coed Hospital."

Allegations

Chief executive of Swansea NHS Trust David Williams said the nature of Cefn Coed
Hospital sometimes meant they had to deal with allegations and complaints of
this type.

"I can confirm that two male nurses have been disciplined for matters, but
certain allegations made against them have failed to be proved," he said.

"They are now back in work."
