Shriners Hospitals for Children in Galveston, Texas, US, is using Diversionary
Therapy Technologies' (DTT) ditto lite device for paediatric patients.

The ditto lite is a multi-cultural tool that uses pre-procedural preparation and
diversionary therapy and is clinically proven to reduce anxiety, minimise
treatment time and improve patient outcomes.

Certified child life specialist Heather Domenick said that ditto lite has become
a crucial tool for the child life department.

"Because all of the Hospital Procedural Preparation stories we use come in
Spanish as well as English, we can provide better procedural and surgical
preparation and understanding across the language barrier," Domenick added.

"I think it's a great asset for any CLS (Child Life Specialist) working in a
burn centre because it can be utilised just about anywhere, is easily cleaned to
meet infection control standards, and it meets the need for distraction,
developmental stimulation, and education."

DTT's ditto device is designed to lower stress and anxiety prior to or during a
procedure using distraction and educational techniques.

The device features an interactive touch-screen and an automatic response to
physical movement, to engage patients and avert attention from a possibly
negative experience.

The handheld device includes numerous interactive games, stories and procedural
preparation tools, available in English and Spanish.
