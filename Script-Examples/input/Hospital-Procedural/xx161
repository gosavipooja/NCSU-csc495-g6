Rural doctor crisis needs action: AMA

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 251  words


THE Rural Doctors Association of Australia (RDAA) and Australian Medical
Association (AMA) are urging the Government to commit to a major rescue package
of rural-specific support incentives to get more doctors working in country
Australia.

Both the AMA and RDAA have identified a range of measures essential to improving
services to country patients including better funding for rural hospitals, a
rural health obligation, expanded specialist outreach services and better
support.

At least 1000 doctors are needed urgently in rural and remote Australia to
ensure even basic access to healthcare in the bush.

Many rural patients now have to wait up to six weeks for a basic consultation or
drive hundreds of kilometres to access a doctor.

RDAA and AMA are calling on the Government to move quickly to introduce the
following two-tiered support structure:

* A Rural Isolation Payment to be paid to all rural doctors (including GPs,
specialists and registrars) to reflect the isolation associated with rural
practice.

* A Rural Procedural and Emergency/On Call Loading to better support rural
procedural doctors (including procedural specialists) who provide obstetric,
surgical, anaesthetic or primary emergency on-call service in rural communities.

The AMA and RDAA estimate the total cost of this rescue package will be
approximately $300 million per year, making it a very cost-effective way of
getting and keeping more doctors in the bush and helping keep rural communities
and rural health services functioning.
