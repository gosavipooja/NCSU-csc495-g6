EMERGENCY ultrasounds and heart readings are being offered by a new consultant
at a county hospital.

A&E consultant Dr Ravindranath Sant is working at Boston Pilgrim Hospital, where
he specialises in procedural sedation, emergency ultrasound and basic
echocardiography - readings of the heart.

He has already introduced procedural sedation in A&E and plans to train all
middle-grade doctors in the department to carry out the same role.

The aim of the procedure is to reduce pain and avoid unnecessary hospital
admissions for patients with fractures and dislocations and for stitching of
facial wounds in children.

As well as his responsibilities at the Pilgrim Hospital, Dr Sant will be
involved in running a soft tissue injury clinic at Skegness and District
Hospital.
