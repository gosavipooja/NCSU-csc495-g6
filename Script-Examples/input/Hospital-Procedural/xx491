Dr Amos returns to Orange Hospital

AN Orange cardiologist who was stood down by the Western NSW Local Health
District (LHD) will return to work today.

The Orange Medical Staff Council said in a statement Dr David Amos was a highly
respected member of the medical community who had the council's support.

"We are pleased that we can finally welcome him back to work this Friday to care
for patients," the statement said.

"The last four months has been a difficult time for all concerned," the
statement said. "Agreement has been reached on the next steps to address the
concerns. This is work in progress."

The MSC executive is working with Orange Health Service and LHD management on a
range of issues.

Dr Amos took the LHD to the Supreme Court earlier this year claiming
investigations concerning he and another doctor, in addition to a warning letter
from OHS general manager Catherine Nowlan, denied him procedural fairness.

The court found procedural fairness had not been given, but the LHD was not
required to give it.
