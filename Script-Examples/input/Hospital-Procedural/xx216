Boost for rural GPs

FEDERAL Member for Dawson De-Anne Kelly said the Commonwealth Government had
decided to double the incentive payments to rural procedural GPs in further
recognition of their additional skills and responsibilities.

From February 2006, rural procedural GPs will be entitled to claim up to $15,000
per year under the government's Practice Incentives Program.

''This boost will provide further support to GPs who provide surgical,
anaesthetic and obstetric services to rural and remote communities throughout
Australia,'' she said.

''This is an important measure for rural communities relying on experienced
general practitioners to keep local hospitals running.

''At present, almost 800 GPs participate in this incentive program.

''The increased payments are designed to encourage these GPs to continue to
provide procedural services and will cost an additional $5.2 million a year.''
