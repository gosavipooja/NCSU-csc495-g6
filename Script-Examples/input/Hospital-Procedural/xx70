HOSPITAL errors in Australia could be drastically reduced by electronic
prescriptions, new research suggests.

It comes as the Federal Government plans to introduce electronic health records
for patients from July 1, and electronic prescribing is also expected to be
implemented further down the track.

The New South Wales University study found medication prescribing errors could
be slashed by up to 66 per cent with the introduction of electronic prescribing
technology in hospitals.

The study reviewed more than 3200 patient records, looking at procedural errors,
which included incomplete or unclear medication orders, as well as clinical
mistakes, such as incorrect doses or drugs.

The study, led by Professor Johanna Westbrook, found procedural prescribing
error rates fell by more than 90 per cent, and the most serious mistakes dropped
by 44 per cent.

The study is published in journal PLoS Medicine.
