Rural dilemma

SIR: Rural doctors have returned to work and it could be stated either that they
are happy with their present pay conditions for working in country hospitals or
that the Unsworth Government has beaten them.

I believe that we were not in contest with the Government. I believe that
procedural rural doctors undertake a great responsibility for which they are
very poorly paid. Procedural general practitioners in urban areas, who perform
the same procedures, are paid at a much higher rate.

Country general practitioners who give anaesthetics now receive less than they
received one year ago. During this time, their professional indemnity insurance
has risen considerably. Over the last two years, it has risen some 300 per cent.

Skilled obstetric procedures, such as forceps and breech deliveries, do not
attract any fee above that paid for a normal confinement.

We have been greatly discriminated against. We feel quite unhappy about our
present situation and we would still ask Mr Unsworth and his Government to look
at the service we give and the pay we receive and, in all fairness, to recognise
that procedural rural doctors deserve to be paid equally with their colleagues
in larger centres.

(Dr) J.R.Harris,

Church Street,

February 10 Mudgee.
