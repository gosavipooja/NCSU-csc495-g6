HIGHLIGHT:Â CHALLENGE: Attracting medical graduates to work in rural areas


RETAINING medical graduates in rural communities is the focus of a discussion
paper released at Tweed Hospital by NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner
yesterday.

The paper is designed to support rural training programs with a package
structure to make it easier for medical trainees to find work in rural
communities.

Ms Skinner said although there were initiatives aimed at training a rural
workforce, it was largely left to the trainee to plot their own course.

She said a training program that matched training with employment opportunities
would hopefully stop the large majority of rural trainees moving back to major
cities to find permanent employment.

Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Health, Melinda Pavey, said the program was
necessary as rural communities were heavily reliant on their local GPs. "We
encourage increased numbers of medical graduates to choose rural and procedural
general practice as their preferred training and career choice," Mrs Pavey said.

"A structured and supported training experience is fundamental to trainees
choosing rural and procedural general practice and going on to provide health
services in rural communities and hospitals upon the completion of their
training program."

Tweed MP Geoff Provest said although the Tweed Hospital was technically classed
as a rural hospital, we wouldn't see as much benefit as other more remote
communities.
