US Procedure Numbers for Medical Imaging Devices 2016 - Research and Markets

LENGTH: 417  words


Oct. 11 -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "US Procedure
Numbers for Medical Imaging Devices 2016 - MedPro" report to their offering.

The following report is a summary of the major procedural codes that were
investigated and analyzed for consideration in the generation of procedural and
market estimates and forecasts in this report.

Imaging will continue to be relied on by physicians and healthcare facilities as
a diagnostic tool, and advancements in imaging technology will drive the number
of procedures that are performed. As the population ages, more imaging
procedures will be required as elderly patients are more likely to be diagnosed
with conditions that require imaging. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and
ultrasound imaging will represent the fastest-growing type of imaging procedures
over the forecast period.

Ultrasound systems are growing in preference due to their rising technology and
clinical applications as well as their low level of invasiveness for patients.
Despite growing concerns of radiation dosages to patients, CT and other
radiation-based modalities continue to remain popular as new devices integrate
low-dose technology.

The number of procedures reported in this report is built from a bottom-up
technique by investigating the number of procedural claims at an outpatient and
inpatient level. Procedural claims for a total of 568 CPT codes and 101 ICD-9-CM
vol.3 codes were investigated and considered as part of this analysis.
