US-based Interpace Diagnostics has announced its medicare administrative carrier
(MAC), Novitas Solutions has assigned a new molecular current procedural
terminology (CPT) code, 81479 to its PancraGen test.

Previously, the PancraGen test was covered under the miscellaneous chemistry
code 84999, which is used to bill a range of tests across the laboratory
industry and does not differentiate between technologies with different
features.

Interpace Diagnostics interim CEO Jack Stover said: "The CPT coding change
represents further confirmation from payers that PancraGen is a clinically
comprehensive and robust molecular test that provides novel insights to
physicians and patients dealing with this life altering disease.

"The new coding enables both Interpace Diagnostics and those hospitals that bill
Medicare directly to use a molecular code when billing for PancraGen, which
could result in incremental reimbursement above the established
Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) payment for this condition."

The new code will have a positive impact on the way claims are submitted and
remittances are received from both Medicare and commercial payers.

PancraGen is an integrated molecular pathology test to determine the risk of
cancer in pancreatic cysts by using a small sample of a thick or viscous
pancreatic cyst fluid.

According to clinical studies, PancraGen is claimed to be 90% accurate, enabling
effective risk stratification of patients.
