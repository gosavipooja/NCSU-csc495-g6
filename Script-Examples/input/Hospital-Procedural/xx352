CORRECTIONS Doctors' poll raises Wran's hopes SYDNEY._ The New South Wales
Premier, Mr Wran, bolstered by preliminary results of a nationwide doctors'
poll, was confident yesterday there would be a substantial resumption of work by
doctors throughout the State. Mr Wran said yesterday that most procedural
specialists in the State were either going back to work or were already working
in public hospitals. Yesterday, a meeting of the Council of Procedural
Specialists overwhelmingly rejected the Federal Government's $166 million
package of changes to Medicare. Mr Wran said those at the meeting who remained
opposed to Medicare were offside with the Government, the public and the
majority of their colleagues. Mr Wran quoted a survey by the Australian Medical
Association which he claimed showed 78 percent of members in favor of ending
industrial action.
