DATELINE: KARACHI


There is an urgent need to legislate a Cyber
Crime law  due to incidents against unassuming victims , recommended
participants of a seminar organised to celebrate 25th anniversary of WAR, the
NGO working against women.


     Women's rights icon in Pakistan Mukhtaran Mai was the guest of honour
on the occasion while Sindh Minister of Culture and Tourism, Sharmila Farooqi
presided the session that attracted  diverse segments of people, comprising
members of the Civil Society, representatives from NGOs, doctors, lawyers,
teachers, human rights activists.
     Members of WAR said they strongly feel that justice has been done in
the Mukhtaran Mai case and that heinous crime like gang-rape, could be
reduced through "no tolerance" approach towards offences committed against
women.
     They urged the Sindh Government for strict enforcement and
implementation of all laws recently passed for women protection and
welfare.
     Participants urged to empower the existent Women Police Stations and
increase their numbers in every district.
     Moreover, medico- legal examination for rape survivors, was demanded
to be made  operational in all major hospitals, including those  in
private sector as Aga Khan Hospital, Ziauddin Hospital.
     Mandatory DNA testing for all cases was also recommended besides
provision for DNA laboratories and relevant gadgets in all districts.
     They also called for mandatory recruitment of more women as state
prosecutors, judges, police officers, medico-legal officers and clerical
force in judiciary.
     Guest of honour Mukhtaran Mai pleaded for speedy
trials  to ensure prosecution of  offenders of the heinous crime.
     The Minister for  Culture and Tourism Ms Sharmila Farooqi, praising
the work of NGOs , reiterated the Government's
resolve to continue its work for  the welfare of women.
     The seminar was also addressed by WAF representative Kausar S. Khan
who reminisced about the environment that led to WAR being formed in
the late 1980s.
     The highlight of the seminar were the key note addresses on Legal &
Procedural Reforms by Barrister Danish Zuberi who appreciated the Sindh
Government's initiative of passing the Harassment at Workplace Act, The Domestic
Violence law and the Child Marriage Restraint  Act, but urged
the government to focus on the challenge of its actual implementation.
     Activist and researcher Sarah Zaman discussed "on field" challenges
in context of medico-legal and the  procedural obstructions hindering
disbursement of fair trial and justice to survivors.  Going through her
experience as a past Director in WAR, she sought need for urgent reforms
in the Medico-Legal Sector.
