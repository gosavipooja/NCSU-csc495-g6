DÁIL CAN'T QUIZ TOP-UP RECIPIENTS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 211 words


THE Dáil's spending watchdog won't be able to grill the recipients of top-up
payments because of a procedural clash.

TDs want hospital executives, including Dr Rhona O'Mahony, Master of Holles
Street, and Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, Master of the Rotunda, to be questioned by the
Public Accounts Committee over their salary boosts.

Politicians yesterday told committee chair John McGuinness that they want the
recipients of the payments - the chairs of the boards of voluntary hospitals and
health agencies - hauled before them.

However, it is understood that committee procedures will not allow the
recipients themselves to appear. Only accounting officers are answerable to the
committee. Despite the procedural clash, Mr McGuinness said he will hold a
special sitting of the PAC next week to quiz HSE bosses.

'We will ask for clarification in relation to the voluntary hospitals and the
chairs of the boards and see if they can be brought before us and seek advice on
how we are going to handle this,' he said.

'That will be a matter of procedure. But we should start with the HSE and the
Department of Health and we should insist on an early hearing.'

Mr McGuinness also said he wants to know whether other senior public sector
staff are in receipt of non-exchequer allowances.
