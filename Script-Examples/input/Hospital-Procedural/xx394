HIGHLIGHT:Â Stryker Spine announced the launch of the LITe (Less Invasive
Technologies) ALIF Procedural Solution.


This comprehensive platform will be featured during the International Meeting on
Advanced Spine Technologies (IMAST) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from July 8th -
10th.



Originating in 2005 with a single interbody device, Stryker's ALIF Portfolio now
features the LITe Anterior Retractor, the Reliance AL Instrumentation System,
the AVS AL and ALign PEEK Spacer Systems, the LITe Plate System, the Anchor-L
Anterior Lumbar Cage System, and most recently, the Aero-AL Anterior Lumbar
Interbody and Fixation System.

With the introduction of the LITe ALIF Procedural Solution, customers can
combine the LITe Anterior Retractor with Aero-AL, the only in-line ALIF device
in the U.S. market that compresses across the interbody.

The combination of these two new technologies supports a less invasive exposure
with minimized retraction.

"Our growing platform of ALIF products is the result of our strategic focus to
add value to our procedural solutions," said John Mayor, Vice President of
Marketing of Stryker Spine.

"The launch of the LITe ALIF Procedural Solution validates our continued
commitment to this evolving segment. We will continue to leverage our innovative
approach to develop differentiated products within the ALIF space for surgeons
and their patients."

The Company offers a diverse array of innovative products and services in
Orthopaedics, Medical and Surgical, and Neurotechnology and Spine, which help
improve patient and hospital outcomes.
