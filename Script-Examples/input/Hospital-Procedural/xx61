Boost for rural procedural GPs

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 145  words


THE Commonwealth Government has decided to double the incentive payments to
rural procedural GPs in further recognition of their additional skills and
responsibilities.

From February 2006, rural procedural GPs will be entitled to claim up to $15,000
per year under the government's Practice Incentives Program.

''This boost will provide further support to GPs who provide surgical,
anaesthetic and obstetric services to rural and remote communities throughout
Australia,'' Health Minister Tony Abbott said.

''This is an important measure for rural communities relying on experienced
general practitioners to keep local hospitals running.''

At present, almost 800 GPs participate in this incentive program.

''The increased payments are designed to encourage these GPs to continue to
provide procedural services and will cost an additional $5.2 million a year,''
Mr Abbott said.
