Manslaughter charge a procedural matter, say police SYDNEY._ Police have charged
a youth with manslaughter after an alleged schoolyard brawl, despite the
protests of the victim's father. A police spokesman, Constable Mick Drylie, said
the manslaughter charge was a procedural matter: ""We've got to go through the
due processes and it may not even get to trial." Two youths, both 16, allegedly
bought a pie and chocolate milk from the canteen at Gorokan High School, on the
New South Wales central coast, and then began arguing over 40 cent change.
Police said that punches were thrown and Year 11 pupil David Cutler, from
Noraville, near Gosford, fell to the ground and became unconscious. David was
taken to the school sick bay and then to hospital but died without regaining
consciousness about 5 p.m. Yesterday David's father, Mr Alan Cutler, described
the manslaughter charge as ""ridiculous". He said the two boys were ""best
mates" who played in the same cricket team and often were ""clowning around". Mr
Cutler said he and his wife, Kerrie, did not know that David had a condition
""the doctors said was like a bomb which could go off at any time". A youth is
due to appear in Wyong Children's Court on May 8. DAVID CUTLER
