THE State Budget will see $46.3 million locked away towards the funding of the
$2 billion Sunshine Coast University Hospital.

Part of this funding will allow the start of roadworks to improve ambulance and
patient access to the public and private hospitals in the Kawana precinct.

Expressions of interest from the private sector to design, build, finance and
maintain the hospital are being evaluated.

Premier Anna Bligh said the budget also would contain almost $9 million to
improve the emergency department of Caloundra Hospital, which would mean a total
investment of $11.5 million.

"At Nambour Hospital we're spending more than $11 million for a new cardiac and
vascular surgery procedural suite, a new dedicated endoscopy procedural unit and
improvements to neurosurgery service, at a total cost of $14.6 million," she
said.

"We're also providing extra inpatient and specialist services at both Caloundra
and Nambour hospitals with an investment of $23.4 million in 2011-12, at a total
cost of $191 million."

Construction on the university hospital is expected to start late next year,
with a 2016 opening date.
