OPERATIONS ARE SUSPENDED AFTER PROCEDURAL ERROR

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 207 words


ALL orthopaedic operations have been suspended at a hospital after a procedural
error forced the withdrawal of an entire theatre team.

The incident at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil prompted North
Glamorgan NHS Trust to announce yesterday a halt all further procedures pending
an external investigation.

The error was further compounded when the trust was unable to assemble a
replacement team because of staff shortages during the summer holiday period.

It would have left insufficient cover to ensure patient safety, although all
other surgery apart from orthopaedics is continuing.

The orthopaedic team, including a consultant surgeon and nursing staff, have
been stopped from carrying out further surgery and are working in different
areas of the hospital.

Phil Williams, the trust's board secretary and director of corporate services,
said the withdrawal of the team was a standard response to an incident during an
operation in which a checking procedure was not properly implemented, resulting
in an error being made.

"Although it was not life-threatening and was rapidly spotted and rectified -
with no long term effects for the patient - the trust takes any such incident
seriously," he said.
