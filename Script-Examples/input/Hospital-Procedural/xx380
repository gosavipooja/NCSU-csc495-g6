QUEENSLAND'S privately practising rural doctors will be given guarantees of long
term medico-legal indemnity protection in the latest bid to encourage them to
stay in the bush.

Health Minister Mike Horan will make his latest offer at the Rural Doctors
Association of Queensland's Gold Coast conference today.

"We are offering full indemnity for private doctors with private patients who
are in rural medicine doing procedural work," he said.

The indemnity meant doctors could abandon expensive medical defence insurance
and do their procedural work, including delivering babies, in public hospitals.

Mr Horan said he wanted to overcome rural doctors' reservations that a different
government could back out of the commitment in the future.

Outgoing RDA state president Shane Sondergeld said solving the "indemnity
crisis" was the priority for rural doctors, who were increasingly worried about
their future.
