OPPOSITION CALL FOR MEDICARE CHANGES

SOURCE: QNP

LENGTH: 204 words


Opposition call for Medicare changes CANBERRA._ The Federal Opposition health
spokesman, Mr Porter, yesterday called on the Government to acknowledge that
urgent changes should be made to its Medicare system. He said specialists, the
Australian Medical Association, nurses, the Voluntary Health Insurance
Association and the Private Hospitals Association of Victoria all agreed that
changes were necessary. Mr Porter made the call although the AMA, led by its
president, Dr Lindsay Thompson, last week bitterly attacked the warring NSW
procedural specialists for making unreasonable demands for changes to Medicare.
""How does the Government explain the queues of 15,000 to 20,000 people waiting
for hospital treatment in Victoria?" Mr Porter asked. ""Procedural specialists'
resignations cannot be blamed." Mr Porter said the queues were a clear
indictment of the Health Minister, Dr Blewett, and proof that Medicare had
failed. He accused the Government of being out of step with the community, which
realised that urgent changes were required. The Opposition Leader, Mr Peacock,
said the Government had ensured that access to adequate health care would remain
the privilege of those with wealth and influence.
