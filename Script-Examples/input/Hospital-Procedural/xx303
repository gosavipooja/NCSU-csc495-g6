LENGTH: 611  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


KARACHI, Dec. 16 -- There is an urgent need to legislate a Cyber

Crime law due to increasing incidents of cyber crime against unassuming

victims including young girls and women, recommended participants of a seminar
organised to celebrate 25th anniversary of WAR, the NGO working

against exploitation of women.

Women's rights icon in Pakistan Mukhtaran Mai was the guest of honour

on the occasion while Sindh Minister of Culture and Tourism, Ms Sharmila Farooqi
presided the session "Rape & Sexual Violence : Legal Reforms"

that attracted diverse segments of people, comprising members of the

Civil Society, representatives from NGOs, doctors, lawyers, teachers,

human rights activists and government officials.

Members of WAR said they strongly feel that justice has been done in

the Mukhtaran Mai case and that heinous crime like gang-rape, could be

reduced through "no tolerance" approach towards offences committed against
women.

They urged the Sindh Government for strict enforcement and

implementation of all laws recently passed for women protection and

welfare, as otherwise, they feared the violence against women will

continue, unabated.

Participants using the forum of this seminar to push forth for some

much needed "Legal, Medical and Procedural Reforms" by the Government

urged the authorities to empower the existent Women Police Stations and

increase their numbers in every district.

Moreover, medico- legal examination for rape survivors, was demanded

to be made operational in all major hospitals, including those in

private sector as Aga Khan Hospital, Ziauddin Hospital.

Mandatory DNA testing for all rape cases was also recommended besides

provision for DNA laboratories and relevant gadgets in all districts.

They also called for mandatory recruitment of more women as state

prosecutors, judges, police officers, medico-legal officers and clerical

force in judiciary.

Guest of honour Mukhtaran Mai on the occasion pleaded for speedy

trials to ensure prosecution of offenders of the heinous crime.

The Minister for Culture and Tourism Ms Sharmila Farooqi, praising

the work of NGOs like War Against Rape, reiterated the Government's

resolve to continue its work for the welfare of women in general,

including effort to eradicate sexual violence.

The Seminar was also addressed by WAF representative Kausar S. Khan

who reminisced about the environment that led to WAR being formed in

the late 1980s.

The highlight of the seminar were the key note addresses on Legal &

Procedural Reforms by Barrister Danish Zuberi who appreciated the Sindh

Government's initiative of passing the Harassment at Workplace Act, The Domestic
Violence law and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, but urged

the government to focus on the challenge of its actual implementation.

Barrister Danish Zuberi, in her address spoke about the laws relating

to rape and the reforms needed to make rape prosecution more effective.

She also suggested that cases of sexual violence, rape and incest be

covered under "Time Limit" of two years as done in terrorism cases.

The senior lawyer said in cases of "compromise" or out of court

settlement, state should become a "Party" and continue with the

prosecution of the accused.

Activist and researcher Sarah Zaman discussed "on field" challenges

in context of medico-legal and the procedural obstructions hindering

disbursement of fair trial and justice to survivors. Going through her
experience as a past Director in WAR, she sought need for urgent reforms

in the Medico-Legal Sector
