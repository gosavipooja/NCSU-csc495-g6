COBB COUNTY: Suit against project survives

Cobb County residents who sued to stop the development of a large church and
small hospital near Lake Allatoona won an important procedural battle Monday.

The Georgia Supreme Court's unanimous ruling overturns a decision last January
by a Cobb County Superior Court judge. That judge dismissed a lawsuit contesting
plans for a 65-acre tract of land on U.S. 41 near Acworth.

Johnson Ferry Baptist Church, an east Cobb mega-church, wants to build a
satellite church and other facilities on the property. WellStar Health System
proposes building doctors' offices, a diagnostic and testing center and,
eventually, a hospital.

Nearby homeowners, led by Teresa Stendahl and son Timothy Cannon, said the
project at the intersection with Awtrey Church Road would pollute water for
hundreds of thousands of people. Lake Allatoona is a major source of drinking
water for residents of Cherokee and Cobb counties.

Bonnie Wilson, WellStar's general counsel, likened the Supreme Court's decision
to no more than a procedural setback.

The case now returns to Cobb Superior Court.
