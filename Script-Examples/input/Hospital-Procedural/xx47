Georgia Supreme Court says HIPAA allows ex parte interviews of doctors

Federal health care privacy law does not prohibit defense counsel from
conducting ex parte interviews of a medical malpractice plaintiff's doctors, the
Georgia Supreme Court has ruled.

The plaintiff sued a hospital for malpractice.

To aid in its discovery, the hospital obtained a qualified protective order
under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), allowing
its attorneys to conduct ex parte interviews with the plaintiff's health care
providers.

The plaintiff argued that HIPAA prohibits such ex parte interviews.

But the court disagreed.

"Based upon the policies underlying HIPAA and fairness in litigation, we
conclude that ex parte interviews may be conducted under HIPAA, if the
procedural requirements for protecting information disclosed during these
interviews have been satisfied," the court said.

In this case, the court concluded that the hospital's qualified protective order
satisfied procedural safeguards mandated by HIPAA.

However, the court decided that the order was overbroad because it allowed the
defense counsel to probe into matters outside the scope of the plaintiff's
limited waiver under state law of the physician-patient privilege with respect
to his med-mal claim.

"[T]he qualified protective order should have limited [the plaintiff's] inquiry
to matters relevant to [the plaintiff's] medical condition which is at issue in
this proceeding. Without this substantive language, the qualified protective
order must be considered deficient," the court said.
