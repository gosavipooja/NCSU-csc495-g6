HIGHLIGHT:Â Catheter lab at Nambour keeps treatment local


NAMBOUR General Hospital's new $18 million cardiac catheter facility, laboratory
and procedural suites will be officially opened today.

The new ward will be able to treat up to 40 patients a day, as well as employ an
additional 43 full-time staff and two cardiologists.

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said the development was a major boost for
public health services on the Sunshine Coast.

"For the first time public patients on the Sunshine Coast have access to the
diagnostic capacity of a cardiac catheter laboratory," Mr Springborg said.
"Patients who previously travelled to Brisbane for cardiac catheter treatment
can now have their procedures performed locally."

The new procedural suites have expanded the hospital's vascular and endoscopy
services.

They include the latest technology for the cardiac, vascular and
gastroenterology fields to improve treatment and patient diagnosis.

"Patients are already benefiting with the new laboratory and dedicated suites
treating their first patients in April 2012," Mr Springborg said. "In that time
more than 1500 patients have had procedures conducted in the new procedural
suites and the laboratory has already provided services to 262 patients."
