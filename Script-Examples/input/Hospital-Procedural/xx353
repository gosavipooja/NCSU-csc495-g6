Specialists set to reject plan SYDNEY._ A meeting of the Council of Procedural
Specialists in Sydney today will almost certainly reject a moratorium on
resignations from New South Wales public hospitals, according to the council
president, Dr Bruce Shepherd. Presidents of three specialist medical colleges
made a joint call on Wednesday for a four-week moratorium on resignations and an
immediate start to negotiations with the Federal and NSW Governments. The
Australian Medical Association president, Dr Lindsay Thompson, gave his full
support to the colleges' proposal yesterday. He said he was ready to throw the
full resources of the AMA into negotiations with the Federal and NSW
Governments.
