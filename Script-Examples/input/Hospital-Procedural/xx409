Doctors blamed SYDNEY._ More than half the public lay the blame for the
year-long New South Wales Medicare dispute on surgeons who withdrew their
services from public hospitals, a Sydney University professor has found.
Professor Stuart Rees is conducting a State-wide survey which he said ""will
depict a side of the long-running dispute the public knows little about".
""There are a lot of surprises in store," he said yesterday. ""The extent to
which patients were used to foster the interests of some procedural specialists
is disgraceful. ""The motives of many procedural specialists were essentially
selfish." Professor Rees, who was sponsored by the Australian Consumers'
Association, said he hoped to publish the findings of his first series of public
interviews by late June.
