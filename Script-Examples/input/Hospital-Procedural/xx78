Cancer

LENGTH: 225 words

DATELINE: U.S.


U.S., Oct. 17 -- ClinicalTrials.gov registry received information related to the
study (NCT02929771) titled 'Using Virtual Reality to Reduce Procedural Pain in
Children With Cancer' on Oct. 7.

Brief Summary: This study will assess the impact of virtual reality (VR) in
decreasing procedural pain related to subcutaneous port (SCP) access in children
with cancer. The study is a pilot-randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a
cross-over design that will provide us with detailed information on the
feasibility of implementing our trial protocol in a future multi-center RCT as
well as preliminary estimate of VR treatment effect on children with cancer
undergoing SCP access, including child and parent factors potentially associated
with VR distraction treatment efficacy.
