THE NSW Government plans to implement a dedicated procedural pathway to help
attract doctors to rural areas. The Minister for Health, Jillian Skinner,
announced the NSW Rural Generalist Training program at the Rural Doctors'
Network annual general meeting on Saturday. Mrs Skinner said the training
program will provide the incentive for the next generation of medical
professionals to move to Western NSW to work. "By creating a procedural pathway
between training and employment opportunities, this program will be instrumental
in attracting young doctors to regional NSW," she said. The Member for Barwon
Kevin Humphries said the provision of a generalist training program would be
extremely beneficial and will allow for doctors to provide primary care as well
as hospital care for those in the community. "One of the great challenges many
communities face is in attracting generalist doctors with particular procedural
skills," Mr Humphries said. "This program will create a structured rural
training pathway that will see young doctors acquire the skills to undertake
procedures in rural hospitals in the fields of obstetrics, emergency, general
surgery and anaesthetics.
