TORONTO - Canadian broadcaster Shaw Media on Thursday said it will co-produce
the homegrown medical procedural Combat Hospital with ABC.

Confirmation of the American deal for the Canadian-U.K. drama means production
on the now untitled series from Sienna Films, Artists Studios and Lookout Point
can go ahead.

There's no word on casting. Shaw Media is set to announce Monday a veteran
director attached to the Canadian medical drama.

Shaw Media's cable drama channel Showcase will air the 13-part series about a
military medical facility in Afghanistan where doctors and nurses treat
coalition troops and Afghan civilians next summer.

ABC and Global Television, Shaw Media's conventional TV network, earlier
collaborated on Rookie Blue, a Canadian cop drama from Entertainment One now in
its second season.

Executive producers on the homegrown drama are Julie Sereny and Jennifer Kawaja
for Sienna Films; Gub Neal, Justin Thompson-Glover and Patrick Irwin for Artists
Studios.

Carrie Stein at 3 Arts Entertainment and Simon Vaughan at Lookout Point are
heading up international sales.
