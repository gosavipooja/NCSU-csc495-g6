Text of report by commercial, news-based 5 Kanal TV on 19 November

[Presenter] Former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko [who is serving a seven-year
sentence in jail] has urged the parliamentary opposition to secure the repeal of
the Criminal Procedural Code.

Her lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko said that the new law would not only destroy the role
of the defence but would also violate the constitutional rights of citizens. In
particular, an individual will not be informed that a criminal case has been
opened against him or her, while law enforcers will be able to conduct secret
video and audio surveillance.

[Vlasenko, at a briefing] Yuliya Volodymyrivna [Tymoshenko] asked me today to
make public her call for all the opposition forces in parliament to put as
quickly as possible the repeal of this instrument for creating a police state,
which the authorities describe as the progressive Criminal Procedural Code, on
the parliamentary agenda.

[Presenter] European Parliament observers Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwasniewski
visited Tymoshenko in her Kharkiv hospital today. They spent two hours in the
medical facility and then left it without any comment for Ukrainian journalists.
