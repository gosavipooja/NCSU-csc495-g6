NAMBOUR General Hospital's new $18 million cardiac catheter facility, laboratory
and procedural suites were officially opened last Friday.

The new ward can treat up to 40 patients a day, and employs an additional 43
full-time staff and two cardiologists.

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said the development was a major boost for
public health services on the Sunshine Coast.

"For the first time public patients on the Sunshine Coast have access to the
diagnostic capacity of a cardiac catheter laboratory," Mr Springborg said.
"Patients who previously travelled to Brisbane for cardiac catheter treatment
can now have their procedures performed locally."

The new procedural suites have expanded the hospital's vascular and endoscopy
services.

They include the latest technology for the cardiac, vascular and
gastroenterology fields to improve treatment and patient diagnosis.

"Patients are already benefiting with the new laboratory and dedicated suites
treating their first patients in April 2012," Mr Springborg said.

"More than 1500 patients have had procedures in the new suites and the
laboratory has already provided services to 262 patients."
