A hospital allegedly defamed by an anonymous blogger may not force his Internet
service provider to disclose his identity under the Cable Communications Policy
Act, the Texas Court of Appeals has ruled.

The hospital sued several anonymous bloggers for defamation, claiming they
unfairly disparaged the hospital and its employees and disclosed private patient
information. A trial judge ordered one of the blogger's Internet service
providers to provide his identity to the hospital pursuant to the Act.

The blogger argued the hospital hadn't met the minimal evidentiary threshold in
pleading its case, and that disclosing his identity would violate his
constitutional rights.

The court agreed, finding the trial court abused its discretion.

"[The Act] is not a procedural vehicle for obtaining such a court order. That
must be accomplished through some procedural device, either state or federal,
depending on the forum of the case. In Texas state courts, the rules of
discovery provide ample methods for obtaining information from third parties,"
the court said.

"[T]he question [then] becomes the degree of actual proof that must be provided
before the balance tips in favor of piercing the constitutional shield and
disclosing the identity of the anonymous blogger. [We hold that] before a
defamation plaintiff can obtain the identity of an anonymous defendant through
the compulsory discovery process he must support his defamation claim with facts
sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion," the court concluded.
