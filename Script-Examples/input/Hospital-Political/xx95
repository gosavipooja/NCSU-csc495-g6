Cancer hospital seeks Capital cure

LENGTH: 185  words

DATELINE: BHARATPUR


BHARATPUR, April 27 -- A delegation from the Bharatpur-based BP Koirala Memorial
Cancer Hospital is visiting the Capital on Thursday in its effort to seek a
solution to the ongoing dispute that has crippled the hospital's services for
the past two months.

Factional war among the hospital staff over the appointment of a new executive
director has affected the hospital services. Many poor patients have been
deprived of free health care.

The delegation plans to mount pressure on the health minister and leaders of the
big three political parties to resolve the crisis.

Rameshworman Shrestha, the chairman of the hospital management committee, said
political meddling has deepened the crisis in the hospital and that only a
political agreement could solve the problem.

The hospital will remain closed from Thursday, except for emergency services, to
press the sides concerned to resolve the dispute at the earliest. Published by
