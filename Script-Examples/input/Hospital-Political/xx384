June 04--LEXINGTON -- The Kentucky Hospitals' Circle of Friends Political Action
Committee (PAC) presented its awards during the annual Kentucky Hospital
Association conference in May. Highlands Health System won this year's Clarence
C. Traum Award, which recognizes the facility and staff that most exceeds their
goal for the year.

Highlands' President and CEO, Bud Warman, accepted the award on behalf of the
health system, which raised more funds than any other Kentucky hospital for the
2014 fundraising year.

The Circle of Friends is a political action committee of the Kentucky Hospital
Association. The organization is instrumental in helping to shape legislation
and other governmental policies regarding health care in the state of Kentucky.
The committee achieves its results through one-on-one meetings with elected
officials, helping to educate them on the struggles of Kentucky hospitals due to
mounting numbers of uninsured patients and inadequate reimbursement.
