DATELINE: CHITWAN


CHITWAN, May 2 -- Normal service delivery at Bharatpur Cancer Hospital continued
to remain suspended for the fifth day on Monday, with no signs of resumption.

The doctors of the hospital, who left for Kathmandu last Thursday to seek a
solution to the dispute over appointment of the hospital's executive director,
have failed to arrive at any breakthrough.

A day after the doctors reached Kathmandu, government formed a three-member
committee led by Dr Senendra Upreti. The team arrived in Chitwan on Monday and
met local political leaders, patients' attendants and the Chief District
Officer.

"Leaders of the three political parties will arrive at a decision based on the
conclusions drawn by the team following their discussions with all
stakeholders," said Dr Rameshwar Man Shrestha, chairman of the hospital's
executive committee.

The hospital's administration has been padlocked for over two months by health
workers close to the Maoists who support the hospital's former executive
director Dr Bhakta Man Shrestha. The former executive director has claimed that
Dr Singh's appointment is procedurally erroneous. Published by HT Syndication
