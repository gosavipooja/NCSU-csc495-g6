An emergency motion demanding ballots among health service staff by hospitals
seeking to opt out of health authority control was passed by the conference
yesterday.

The motion, moved by David Bellotti, the party's candidate in the forthcoming
by-election at Eastbourne, stated that allowing hospitals to become
self-governing trusts would disrupt health care planning and exacerbate staff
shortages.
