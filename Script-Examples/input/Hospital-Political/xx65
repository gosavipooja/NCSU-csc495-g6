BEIJING -- China's political advisors on Tuesday put forward proposals on
reforms of public hospitals and medical insurance.

A statement issued after a meeting of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, the country's top political
advisory body, said attendees agreed that despite progress, ordinary people
still find medical services scarce and expensive.

They suggested changes to public hospital management and a new system of payment
and benefits for medical staff to free hospitals from dependency on revenue from
drug sales, said the statement.

Community medicine should be another priority with cooperation between urban
hospitals and community clinics, according to the meeting, which was chaired by
Yu Zhengsheng, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.

Vice Premier Liu Yandong attended the meeting and admitted that medical reform
is at a tough stage. She promised that the government would make basic medical
services a priority.
