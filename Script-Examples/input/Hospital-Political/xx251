The Liberal Democrats yesterday launched their plans to cut patient waiting
times by putting more staff and beds in Scotland's hospitals. Parliamentary
candidate Nicol Stephen pledged GBP 50million a year to implement the plans to
tackle the country's health service.

The party aims to free beds by employing 2,000 more nurses, 300 consultants and
1,500 other health professionals such as physiotherapists, radiographers and
dieticians.

It also hopes to clear 500 beds a day by reducing hospital-acquired infections.

Yesterday, Mr Stephen, who was on the election trail at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary, said: "It is shocking that 500,000 bed days every year are occupied
by patients who caught an infection in hospital.

"We will reduce the transmission of illness within hospitals with a hospital
-based infection control strategy.

"Our policy will be delivered by doubling the number of specialist
infection-control nurses." The Lib Dems also outlined plans to reduce waiting
times by increasing community and convalescence places by 1,000 and making
increased use of local health centres.

The party also pledged to offer patients who have had to wait longer than the
guaranteed period the choice of being treated privately or outside Scotland.

Mr Stephen added: "Those in need of medical treatment deserve better and
Scottish Liberal Democrats are determined to see they get it.

"Our five-point plan will make the difference by cutting waiting times and
increasing the number of beds available." Caption:
