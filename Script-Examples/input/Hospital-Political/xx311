SECTION: Vol. IV No. 129

LENGTH: 226  words


Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) on Thursday demanded security of doctors and
medical staff demanded Dr. M. Idress Adhi, PMA Karachi President said the PMA
has always demanded for security of doctors during their performance of duties,
particularly in the public sector hospitals. The Doctors need mental peace and
conducive environment for better discharges of duties equal to providing solace
to suffering humanity. But, it appears that now and then the hospital
administration have failed to bring about discipline in maintenance of working
conditions that obviously, resulting in several incidents when doctors are
beaten and maltreated either by attendants of the patients or the political
workers.

One such incident appeared about a couple of days back when despite the security
guards appointed one male attendant carrying weapon with him entered into labour
room of Civil Hospital Karachi and threatened the lady doctors and women in
labour. The incidence was reported to high ups but nothing concrete has so far
been done for provision of security of doctors. The PMA demands that govt.
should look into this grievous matter and order the concerned hospital
administrators to take stern measures for protection of duty doctors of public
sector hospital and remove the political influence and interference of political
parties from these hospitals.
