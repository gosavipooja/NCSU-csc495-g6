LENGTH: 190 words

DATELINE: KOCHI


KOCHI, March 20 -- The nurses strike at the Lakeshore Hospital here attained a
renewed vigour with various political parties holding marches on Monday in
solidarity with the nurses. The nurses will carry out a march from the Nettoor
Market to the Lakeshore Hospital on Tuesday.

The CPM, CPI, PDP, Solidarity, various trade unions and corporation councillors
will take part in the march which will be taken out under the banner of
Janakeeya Samara Sahaya Samiti.

"We will continue with the strike until the hospital management reinstates all
the trainee nurses", said Ramya Rani of the United Nurses Association, Lakeshore
branch. Meanwhile, the hospital management has made it clear that the trainee
nurses will not be reappointed. The right to appoint or dismiss the trainee
nurses is the sole discretion of the hospital management, Lakeshore Hospital MD
Dr Philip Augustine said. In the agreement which was signed after last month's
strike the reappointment of the trainee nurses was not included, he said. He
also appealed to the nurses to end the strike and join for duty. Published by HT
