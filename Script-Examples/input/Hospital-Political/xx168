Stop political interference

LENGTH: 126 words


The NHS is one of our great British institutions and is much loved and needed.
Yet despite large increases in money from taxpayers the NHS seems to be in
trouble.

The plight of Mr Chambers at Queen Mary's Hospital Sidcup with his two
infections and the stories of dirty rooms was appalling (News Shopper February
16). And Queen Elizabeth Hospital Woolwich cutting operations to meet Government
targets is unacceptable (News Shopper February 2).

I welcome the Tories' vow to make hospitals cleaner bring back matron and reduce
political interference in the NHS as priorities.

Under Labour there has been too much political interference and political
correctness which has harmed our health service.
