hospitals

LENGTH: 272  words


Insaf  Doctors Forum (IDF) has demanded politicians and local government
representatives stop interfering with administrative matters of hospitals and
harassing the staff members.

In a statement issued on Sunday, the IDF members said that every institution
functioned within the jurisdictions determined by the law, however some
provincial assembly and LG members were constantly interfering in administrative
matters of the hospitals and threatening the medical staff.

They lamented,  The forum has received several complains citing political
interference in hospitals and many LG members and workers of political parties
are using references of higher officials demanding protocol and special
attention during their visits.

Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) IDF General Secretary Dr Mudir informed, Some
politicians visit hospitals with gunmen to show power and spread fear amongst
the staff.

They have threatened and abused doctors and other supporting staff during these
visits, he added. Mudir stated that most of the complaints were received from
Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) and KTH.

He further said, They argue with doctors and threaten them that if they did not
facilitate them then they will be terminated from their jobs.

The KTH official requested the leadership of all mainstream political parties to
control their workers and stop them from interfering into the administration
matters of the hospitals.

He also demanded of the provincial health minister and secretary health to issue
instructions to the hospitals' staff not to obey illegal demands of political
workers and ban arms and guns inside the premises of the hospitals.
