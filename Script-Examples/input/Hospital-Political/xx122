Political football

The news media have jumped all over the Walter Reed Hospital in Virginia these
past weeks because of several incidents concerning the treatment of returning
vets from Iraq.

Your March 9 political cartoon was an obnoxious display of anti-administration
(Bush bashing). The Veterans Affairs hospitals across the country seem to be
getting the brunt of these so-called "mistreatments" of our veterans.

I am a disabled veteran and have received excellent treatment here at the Salt
Lake VA Hospital as well as VA hospitals in New York City and Chicago. The VA
hospital system was considered the top hospital system in the country within the
past six months. This is a good tribute to our government taking care of its
veterans.

I feel the Walter Reed incident has become a political football for the news
media and the Democratic Party. Shame on this type of reporting.
