GEM OF THE DAY; ELECTION WIN A TRIUMPH FOR PEOPLE POWER

SECTION: LETTERS; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 143 words


WHAT an amazing result in the Scottish Parliamentary election - a retired GP
stands on an independent ticket, takes on the might of the main political
parties, and triumphs.

The victory of Dr Jean Turner in Strathkelvin and Bearsden is a true victory for
people power. I hope the political parties all learn a lesson from this result.

People voted for Dr Turner because they felt the politicians were not taking
their concerns about the future of Stobhill Hospital seriously. The people said
they wanted the hospital to retain its general hospital status, the politicians
nodded agreement and then went right on to support the Health Board's plans to
change acute health services across Glasgow.

Dr Turner was having none of this and has shown the politicians that they cannot
go on taking our votes for granted.
