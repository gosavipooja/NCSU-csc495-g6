LENGTH: 177  words


Provincial Minister for Health Jam Mehtab Hussain Dahar on Monday directed
administration of all government hospitals to close down offices of all
political parties in their premises, adding no pressure should be tolerated in
this regard.

Presiding over a meeting here in his office, he said that government hospitals
should look like hospitals, not offices of the political parties and their
premises should be cleaned from political slogans, banners, pamphlets and such
other ugly things.

He said it is prime responsibility of government hospitals to provide better
facilities of treatment to the patients and they should feel comfortable when
they visit these hospitals.

He said that the second phase of polio drive was under way in districts of East,
Central and Korangi and due to certain reasons the drive has been further
extended. He said in remaining districts of Sindh the target of vaccinating 6.16
million children will be achieved.

He said that the last polio case in Sindh was reported in February 2015 and in
Karachi city it was reported in October 2014.
