'Close down all political offices at govt hospitals'

SECTION: Vol. 25 No. 202

LENGTH: 202  words


Sindh Health Minister Jam Mehtab Dahar on Monday issued instructions to
administrations of public hospitals to shut down offices of all political
parties established inside their premises.

He said hospitals should not resemble offices of political parties and should be
cleansed of all political slogans, banners, literature or graffiti on walls.

The health minister said the prime responsibility of government hospitals to
provide better treatment facilities to patients who should feel comfortable when
they visit hospitals.

Several paramedical associations which are affiliated with one political party
or the other haven't established their offices inside hospital premises but have
hoisted party flags, portraits of leaders and painted slogans on the walls.

Health officials disclosed that instructions to remove political offices from
hospitals came after paramedics at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and
National Institute of Child Health, many representing the health of Pakistan
People's Party, boycotted duties and demanded payment of health allowances.

These employees refused to listen to their leaders and caused great
embarrassment to the Sindh health department and ruling part in the province.
