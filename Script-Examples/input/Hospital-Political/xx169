Mayor Joseph "Erap" Estrada on Monday asserted that there is no truth to the
accusations of his opponents for the mayoralty post that the public hospitals in
Manila serve only those who will vote for him on May 9.

Estrada assured Manilenos that his administration will continue to deliver
prompt, quality, and free health services in Manila's six public hospitals
regardless of their political leanings.

The camps of former Mayor Alfredo Lim and Rep. Amado Bagatsing have told
residents in their campaign sorties that the city-owned hospitals only serve
pro-Estrada residents.

"It (selective provision of medical services) will never happen under my term.
Our hospital services are non-political. Regardless of who you are, what your
religion is, your gender, your background, and even your political beliefs, as
long as you are a legitimate Manileno, you will receive the same free healthcare
services from our health institutions," Estrada stressed.

He said he has a long-standing order to doctors and personnel of the six public
hospitals to promptly take care of patients seeking medical treatment. Manila's
six public hospitals are Sta. Ana Hospital, Ospital ng Tondo, Ospital ng
Sampaloc, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, Justice Jose Abad Santos General
Hospital, and Gat Andres Bonifacio Memorial Medical Center.
