London hospital opt-outs shelved

PLANS to allow four teaching hospitals in London to opt out of health authority
control from next April have been shelved in the face of mounting controversy
over the Government's health service changes, writes Jack O'Sullivan.

William Waldegrave, Secretary of State for Health, will announce tomorrow at the
Conservative Party conference in Blackpool that applications for trust status
from St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, King's College Hospital, St Bartholomew's
and St Thomas's are to be put on ice until a special inquiry into London's
health services reports after the general election.

The move will be seen as a climbdown by the Government from its enthusiastic
support of self-governing trusts for teaching hospitals.

The financial problems of Guy's Hospital in central London, the flagship trust,
emerged within three weeks of its establishment as an opted-out trust, last
April. Job cuts had to be announced after a deficit of pounds 800,000 emerged
within the first few months.

The experience has clearly warned the Government off creating further trusts in
the capital.
