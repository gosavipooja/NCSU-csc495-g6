HIGHLIGHT: DEADLY: The superbug


HOSPITAL superbug MRSA kills 20,000 patients a year and cripples thousands,
campaigners claimed yesterday.

They said Department of Health figures, putting the number at 5,000, were a
decade out of date.

And the MRSA Support Group warned urgent action was needed to stop the death
toll rising still further.

Chairman Tony Field, 64, who was forced to give up his job after being left on
crutches by a hospital infection, said: "The Government is in a state of denial
over the whole matter and they ought to wake up and face the truth before they
can get matters right."

He added: "We call it 'the unnecessary infection' because if the hospitals were
clean the problem would be reduced enormously."

He also said doctors were not putting MRSA on death certificates. A Department
of Health spokeswoman said: "It is difficult to establish whether MRSA is the
cause of death as patients are often seriously ill with other conditions.

"However, we have made it clear that tackling hospital superbugs is a top
priority."

Labour MP John Lyons held a special Commons debate about improving hospital
cleanliness.

He said cleaners working for private firms should be axed, with senior nurses
put in charge of cleaning staff to make sure the job is done properly.

But Liberal Democrat health spokesman Paul Burstow added: "When it comes to
fighting MRSA, this Government is in the dark."
