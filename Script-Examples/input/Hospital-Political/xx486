A MATER Hospital spokesman last night confirmed that a laptop computer stolen
from the hospital earlier this week has been returned.

A statement from the Ulster Political Research Group (west Belfast branch) said
that it had recovered the laptop computer which had been stolen from the Belfast
hospital earlier this week.

The computer, which is understood to have contained research data, was returned
to the Crum Road hospital on Wednesday night.

A hospital spokesman said that the computer did not contain any personal details
of patients.

"The UPRG would appeal to young people and criminal elements to allow the vital
services of the Mater Hospital to be delivered without these hindrances and
shameful acts, " spokesman John White said.
