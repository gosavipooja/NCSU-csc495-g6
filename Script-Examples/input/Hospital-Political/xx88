WELLINGTON -- The Government will today release its hospital plan, finally
bringing certainty to communities about what services their local hospital will
offer.

Health Minister Bill English is due to launch the five-year plan at Wanganui
Hospital.

Mr English said the launch would coincide with him seeking support from other
political parties for the plan's implementation ''as a step towards wider
political consensus on health issues''.

The plan will designate services to be performed at every hospital, and is
expected to downgrade the number of high-tech hospitals performing a full range
of major surgery.

A leaked Health Funding Authority memo in March prompted uproar when it
suggested elective surgery might disappear from Kaitaia, Whakatane, Masterton,
Wairau, and Ashburton Hospitals and that surgery in Gisborne, Wanganui and
Greymouth Hospitals might also be at risk.

At the time Mr English said everyone needed certainty, and changes could not be
made to hospitals in isolation but they were all inter-related.

He said the plan was ''revolutionary'' in determining what acute and emergency
services would be provided across the country.--NZPA
