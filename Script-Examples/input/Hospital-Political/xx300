MP Greg Knight: "It is a battle we must win"

LENGTH: 171  words


"I'M HERE today for the same reason you are here. I want to see services at this
hospital saved.

"It's very rare to get an issue which unites people of all political parties,
and people who have no political views, young and old, nurses, doctors and
staff, businessmen, retired people, residents and tourists.

"But this is the issue that has done it, the future of Bridlington Hospital.

"Quite frankly, we should not need to be here today. We have been badly let down
by hospital trust managers. I have no confidence whatsoever in hospital trust
managers and if they had any shred of decency they would all resign.

"Even if Alan Johnson votes with the trust, that hospital services should be
downgraded, I would say to you don't lose heart.

"The matter does not end there.

"As long as these bricks and mortar remain, there is a valid campaign to sustain
this hospital, to expand services.

"This is a battle that won't be over when Alan Johnson makes his decision.

"The battle will go on and I can assure you, it is a battle we must win."
