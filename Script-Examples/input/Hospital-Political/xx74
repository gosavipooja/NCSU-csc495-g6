WANG WANXING SAID HE MIGHT SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY

Police have forced a veteran Chinese dissident to return to a psychiatric
hospital after he said he might publicly discuss his seven years confined to the
institution, a human rights group reported Tuesday.

According to accounts from his wife and a prominent exiled dissident, Wang
Wanxing, 50, had appeared stable and lucid in the three months since his
conditional release from the police-run Ankang Hospital, New York-based Human
Rights in China said.

But the group said eight police officers took Wang from his home in Beijing on
Nov. 23 and returned him to Ankang, four days after he told the hospital
director he might hold a news conference to discuss the conditions he endured
during his confinement.

His forcible return underscored the extremes the Communist government is
resorting to in its effort to silence dissent. With unemployment in cities high,
rural incomes stagnant and corruption pervasive, the Communist Party fears that
any political challenges could spiral beyond its control.

Police pressured Wang's wife to admit that he is mentally unstable, Human Rights
in China said.

Wang first ran afoul of the political system in the mid-1970s and spent 17
months in a labor camp for speaking out against China's Communist leaders.

Wang was sent to Ankang in 1992 after he tried to unfurl a banner in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square commemorating victims of the military assault on democracy
demonstrators in 1989.

Hospital officials told his wife that Wang was suffering from "political
monomania," Human Rights in China said.
