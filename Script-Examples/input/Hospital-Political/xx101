Deputy Director Admin  and  Focal Person, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Dr

order that the administration had removed all wall chalking, panaflax, banners,
flags and portraits of political party's leadership from OPDs, Wards, doctors
and staff colonies

He said offices of political parties had already been closed down in the
premises of healthcare and no any office of medical wing of political party
exist any more in the institution.  He said prime responsibility of public
hospital administration is to provide better treatment facilities to patients
who should feel comfortable when they visit hospital.

He said several paramedical associations haven't established their offices
inside hospital premises but hoisted party flags, portraits of leaders and
painted slogans on the walls.

Dr Jamali said health institutions should be freed from politics as they provide
treatment to all segments of society without any discrimination. He said
administration had clear stance on the issue that the health institution should
be spared from all kind of political interferences.

It was pertinent to mention here that Sindh Health Minister Jam Mehtab Dahar had
issued strict instructions to administrations of public hospitals to shut down
offices of all political parties established inside their premises.
