HOSPITAL HOPE AS SPENDING GOES UP

SECTION: Pg. 4

LENGTH: 158 words


MIDLAND hospital campaigners are hoping increased spending on the National
Health Service announced in the Budget will help their battle.

Members of the Save Kidderminster Hospital Campaign and the local political
group, Health Concern, are fighting to prevent services at the General Hospital
in the town from being downgraded.

They claimed today that the accident and emergency service at the hospital
should no longer be under threat because of a lack of finance.

Worcestershire Health Authority's review of healthcare in the county will see
some services transferred to a new pounds 91 million 'super' hospital currently
being built at Newtown, Worcester.

But Gordon Brown's budget is seen as a chance for investment in local services.

Dr Richard Taylor, campaign chairman, said that he hoped this would lead to the
scrapping of 'rationing by postcode for treatment of cancer, heart disease and
neurological diseases'.
