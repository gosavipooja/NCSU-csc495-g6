Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) is undergoing tests at Piedmont Hospital after
complaining of severe headaches.

Hospital spokeswoman Nina Montanaro said Coverdell was admitted Saturday night.

"He had been experiencing severe headaches," she said. "They're doing some
tests. We expect him to be in the hospital for two or three days."

Hospital officials would not further characterize the problem. Eric Tanenblatt,
a family friend who has worked with Coverdell in past political campaigns, said
any further developments would be announced by the senator's office later in the
week.

Coverdell, 61, Georgia's senior senator, has reported no serious health
problems. He is known for working long hours.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), a close ally, said he was alerted
by a Coverdell senior aide Sunday.

"They really didn't know what the problem was or how serious it was," Lott said.
"We are hoping and praying for the best."

Coverdell was not taking calls, and Lott said he did not speak to him directly.

Coverdell was a Republican leader in the state Senate and then for two years was
director of the Peace Corps before his election to the U.S. Senate in 1992, when
he defeated incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler Jr.  He was re- elected in 1998.
