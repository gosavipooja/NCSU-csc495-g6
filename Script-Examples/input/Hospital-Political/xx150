In custody : Prisoner dies at hospital

LENGTH: 229  words


A tribesman arrested over a property dispute died at a hospital while in the
custody of the Khyber Agency political administration. Locals protested against
his death at a market in Landikotal on Tuesday. "Masood, a resident of Mirdad
Khel in Landikotal, was suffering from cholera. Other prisoners in the lock-up
asked the political administration to take him to the hospital but they
refused," a local protesting Masood's death told The Express Tribune. "However,
on Tuesday, when his condition was deteriorating, the prisoners raised a hue and
cry, after which he was taken to the hospital."

The protesters quoted doctors at the hospital in Landikotal as saying Masood's
condition was critical and severe dehydration had caused the current state.
Masood ultimately died at the hospital. The protesters, including his father
Akhtar Amin, accused the political administration of causing the tribesman's
death.

Amir said his son was not a militant and was in the custody of the political
administration over a minor dispute. "Why did the administration treat him this
way?" the grieving father said. The protesters urged the government investigate
the matter and transfer the political tehsildar and assistant political agent
from the area.
