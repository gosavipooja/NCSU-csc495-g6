CHISHOLM U-TURN ON HOSPITAL CLOSURES

HEALTH Minister Malcolm Chisholm has ordered a halt to hospital closures
following massive nationwide protests.

He has put a freeze on any shutdown plans until he has seen a report on the
future of the NHS in Scotland due out next year.

Hopes are growing that he now intends to reprieve Glasgow's Queen Mother's
Maternity Hospital along with several others.

In a letter to MSPs he said he is planning an announcement on the Queen Mum's
soon.

Mr Chisholm's U-turn follows bruising talks with Labour MPs at Westminster. Many
feared a backlash against the state of the NHS in Scotland could cost them their
jobs.

Carolyn Leckie, health spokeswoman of the Scottish Socialist Party, said:
"Malcolm Chisholm can dress this up any way he likes. This is effectively the
moratorium on closures which we have been demanding."

But the SNP's Shona Robison said: "This still does not secure the future for
hospitals like the Queen Mother's and Stobhill. He must make it crystal clear
which facilities will be given more breathing space and which ones won't."
