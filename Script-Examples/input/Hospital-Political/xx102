NAVI MUMBAI: The city cops, political leaders and civic officials got a closer
view of the newly-opened Airoli civic hospital on Thursday, unlike the local
residents, who were kept away from the inauguration.

The opening function was carried out under heavy police bandobast, following
political protests during the Nerul civic hospital OPD inauguration earlier this
week.

The heavily-guarded hospital in Airoli had cops blocking the movement of
residents on the bylane leading to the civic hospital in sector 3.

Following political protests, staged during the Nerul civic hospital opening on
Monday, cops turned up in great numbers at the CBD civic hospital inauguration
on Tuesday.

However, on Thursday, no residents were allowed inside the new hospital
premises. All roads leading to the hospital near the ward office were also
closed.

"When a public facility, built with taxpayers' money, is thrown open, citizens
should get first access. It was unfair to stop residents from entering the
hospital premises on the day of its inauguration," said a resident Mazhar Khan.

The onlookers, who came to catch a glimpse of the new healthcare facility
developed by Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, had to do it from a distance.
This led to traffic bottlenecks on the surrounding routes as well.

"After the Nerul pandemonium, we had to take precautionary measures to avoid
repetition," said a senior cop.
