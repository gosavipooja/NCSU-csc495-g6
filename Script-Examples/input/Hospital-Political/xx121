Tampa General Hospital president Bruce Siegel on Wednesday brought to the
nation's capital his mantra that privatization is the best path for many  public
hospitals.

At a forum on the future of public hospitals, Siegel outlined the problems  TGH
and other public hospitals have faced.

He said earlier this year, before he presented his plan to privatize TGH,  the
hospital faced insurmountable financial troubles.

"We were heading toward a meltdown," Siegel said.

Among the problems was a lack of financial support from local governments.  Add
to that the problem of people who did not want to do business with a  public
hospital because it is subject to public records laws, and there was  little
incentive to remain public, Siegel said.

Had the decision to go private not been made, he said, "we were heading  into
severe difficulty very quickly."

A private governing board assumed control of the hospital last week.

Other speakers at the forum who head up public hospitals agreed that
privatization is the best path.

"I don't think there are any advantages to staying public," said John A.
Fairman of D.C. General Hospital in Washington.

The forum was sponsored by the Joint Center for Political and Economic  Studies
and the Commonwealth Fund.
