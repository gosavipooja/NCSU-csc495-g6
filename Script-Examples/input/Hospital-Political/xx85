Police and bed number query

LENGTH: 219  words


GOLD Coast police numbers and hospital beds dominated State Parliament yesterday
as political parties continued their by-election battle over Gaven.

Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg said Labor's candidate Phil Gray had said
the Coast's new hospital, to be built within the next decade, would have only
500 beds.

''As the present Gold Coast Hospital has 733 public hospital beds, will the
minister tell the people of Gaven if the Labor candidate was right and that
public hospital beds are going to be cut, or does he simply not have a clue
about what is happening on the Gold Coast and the Beattie Labor Government's
plans for health?'' he said.

Health Minister Stephen Robertson said bed numbers would be determined after
public and industry consultation.

The Opposition also asked why vital information about violent bikie gangs was
not passed on to police at a kickboxing tournament that ended with a shootout at
the Royal Pines more than a week ago.

Police Minister Judy Spence said the police were given information about bikie
gang members on a regular basis but she refused to comment on operational
decisions.

Ms Spence also refused to comment on the bashing of two police officers who were
attacked while waiting for back-up at Helensvale recently.

''The incident . . . is still being investigated,'' she said.
