KOLKATA: West Bengal Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday expressed concern
about vandalism at private hospitals and nursing homes in the city and said she
will talk to the hospital authorities to know the problems being faced by
them.An angry mob recently ransacked a reputed private hospital in the city
following death of a patient. Another group of unruly people had also ransacked
the government-run SSKM Hospital in the city.

"Some people often ransack and vandalise hospitals which is not at all
desirable. There is no need to ransack a hospital which provides medical
treatment. I have noticed two such incidents in the city recently. I shall talk
to the authorities of private hospitals," Mamata said on Friday. She also
criticised the previous state government and attacked her opposition political
parties. "Those who were in power earlier, did not do any work and now are
giving lectures. We have inherited a huge debt burden from the previous
government. Despite financial constraints, we are constantly working for
people," she said, hinting clearly at the CPM-led Left Front government which
was ousted from power by her in 2011.Mamata also said that earlier everyone used
to say 'Bengal is finished'. "But now people praise the huge progress which
Bengal has witnessed in the past six years." "CPM is a lost case. Congress
should focus on Delhi first. BJP should set its house in order," she said.
