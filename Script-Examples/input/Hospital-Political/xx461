DATELINE: Watford



THE accident and emergency unit at either Watford General Hospital or Hemel
Hempstead Hospital could be axed, South West Hertfordshire MP Richard Page has
warned.

Mr Page made the claim at a political conference in his constituency on Friday,
October 26, on health issues following the announcement of the closure of the
Hemel Hempstead maternity unit.

He said: "The probability of Watford and Hemel Hempstead hospitals operating to
the same level of activity and medical speciality is looking increasingly
unlikely.

"The political decision to keep both Watford and Hemel Hempstead hospitals open
is looking more and more like a political quick fix.

"The situation will grow more and more unsatisfactory day by day, with one
hospital gaining an enhanced facility and the other losing."

He said recent decisions to move the maternity unit to Watford and opthalmics to
St Albans are the beginning of a shake up in healthcare provision.

He added: "Where will all this lead? It seems likely that one of the accident
and emergency units at these hospitals could go. They are providing separate A&E
services, but the future for both is looking increasingly bleak."

He concluded that a new hospital in south west Hertfordshire should be
considered.
