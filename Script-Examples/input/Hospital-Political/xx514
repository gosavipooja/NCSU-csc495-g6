SANTIAGO (AP) - Chilean Gen. Augusto Pinochet was rushed to
 hospital yesterday, hours after a retired army general blamed him
 for dozens of political killings in 1973.

 Pinochet, 85, suffered "strong headaches, briefly lost consciousness and has a
minor loss of strength in the left side of his body," Santiago Military Hospital
said in a statement yesterday, describing symptoms that could suggest a stroke.
It said blood to his brain stopped briefly.

Neurology chief Dr. Sergio Ferrer said Chile's former ruler and dictator was
"recovering well."

On television Thursday night, retired Gen. Joaquin Lagos said Pinochet was
responsible for political killings by the Caravan of Death - a military party
that toured several cities after his bloody 1973 coup, dragging 75 political
prisoners from jail and executing them brutally.

Lagos is the first high-level military official to formally accuse Pinochet of
direct involvement in the deaths of leftists and political opponents.
