Re: So many charities, so little idea what goes on, Michael Campbell, Jan. 20

Michael Campbell left readers with the impression that BC Children's Hospital
Foundation made a political donation to the Liberal Party of Canada in 2002.

We'd like to set the record straight. The former president of the foundation
also served as government relations liaison for the Children's & Women's Health
Centre of BC. Her duties included attending government meetings and events to
discuss the creation of a national child health network.

In the case Campbell cited, the foundation was reimbursed by the health centre
for expenses related to a Liberal party dinner. The purpose of attending the
dinner was to enable representatives of the health centre to meet with senior
government officials who were not based in B.C. The purpose was not to support a
political party.

At no time are charitable donations to Children's Hospital used to support
political parties or any other activities not directly related to supporting
clinical, surgical, research and community programs to help sick children get
better.

Campbell's failure to contact us has misled readers about a charity that this
year will give $30 million to help sick children.
