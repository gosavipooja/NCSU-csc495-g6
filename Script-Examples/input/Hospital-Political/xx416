Hospital is inevitably a 'political football'

SECTION: Pg. 8

LENGTH: 187  words


The chief executive of my local hospital trust has expressed concerns  Stafford
Hospital may be turned into a "political football" in the election.

There are concerns  that would give staff morale more battering, although the
chief executive, Antony Sumara, had told Stafford Borough Council's health
scrutiny committee that staff morale at the hospital was rising again. That was
March 11.

I think the hospital already is a bit of a political football.

I do not want it to become too much of one in a bad way.

I do not want to be hi-jacked by calculating politicians too much, but on the
other hand, the care of patients in the Great British NHS needs to be a major
issue in any General Election. It would be unhealthy if it was not so.

So it should be getting attention from politicians.

There is a need to consider the effects of a hospital becoming a political
football, not only on the staff, but also on the bereaved and on those whose
loved ones suffered when there were problems.

Concerns about staff morale could put some people off from speaking out about
things, though we are very much indebted to staff.
