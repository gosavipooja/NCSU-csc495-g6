slogans like remove MS civil hospital & save hospital, accept genuine demands of
paramedics, stop illegal allotments of offices to medical wings of political
parties and bring improvement in health delivery system in hospital.

President PPMSA Karachi Division Mohammad Nazeer Abbasi while addressing the

incompetent and inefficient MS civil hospital and a number of departments were
not functioning in hospital.  He said tenure of current MS of hospital had

vascular surgery wards have been closed in healthcare, professors remain absent
from OPD duties,  administration illegally allot offices to medical wings of
political parties, MRI machines are non-functional since a year and
administration have failed to resolve the problems being faced by paramedics.

He demanded of the Sindh government, health minister, secretary health and other
high-ups to  immediately remove the MS of Sindh's largest healthcare from his
post as soon as possible and appoint competent officer  on this post in order to
improve health delivery system in hospital.
