HAMILTON -- Labour leader Helen Clark has been barred from holding a meeting at
Waikato Hospital, a move she says is unprecedented.

"I am outraged. I have never struck this in all my years in politics," she said
yesterday after Health Waikato chief executive Jan White ordered that a
union-organised meeting with Ms Clark could not be held on hospital grounds.

Miss Clark, a former health minister, was to meet Nurses' Organisation members
and Service Workers' Union representatives at the Bryant Centre at Waikato
Hospital in Hamilton yesterday.

She said she understood the centre was regularly hired to outside groups. The
ban on her meeting was a "politicisation of the health system".

Waikato Hospital communications manager Anne Evans said the meeting was
discovered by hospital management on Sunday when posters went up. Ms White
contacted Miss Clark's office to say it could not go ahead. The State Services
Commission and the Crown Company Monitoring Unit had ruled that the hospital
could not host political parties or candidates, Ms Evans said. --NZPA
