Chisholm halts hospital axe hours before confidence vote

UNDERFIRE Health Minister Malcolm Chisholm made an embarrassing U-turn over
plans to axe a hospital yesterday - hours before a crucial no-confidence vote.

Mr Chisholm dramatically halted the controversial plans to close Glasgow's Queen
Mother's maternity unit.

And he pledged to keep it open until a Pounds 100million complex to house it and
the city's Yorkhill Sick Kids Hospital is finished.

Decision

Campaigners fighting to save the Queen Mum's were last night delighted at the
decision.

But political rivals branded it a "stay of execution" for the Health Minister.

Last night Tory leader David McLetchie hit out: "There were serious questions
about his competence and a back bench rebellion was on the cards.

"Malcolm Chisholm has only bought a stay of execution to keep his Labour and Lib
Dem troops on side, but this is a temporary reprieve." The SNP's Holyrood leader
Nicola Sturgeon also attacked Mr Chisholm, demanding he also help the threatened
emergency department at Livingston's St John's Hospital.

But the Health Minister said the plans represented the "gold standard" in health
care. He added: "I recognise that the Queen Mother's and Yorkhill provide an
important national service for the whole of Scotland."

Campaigner Sarah McHenry, 33, said: "Treatment provided at the Queen Mum's to
expectant mothers is fantastic."
