SECTION: Vol. 09 No. 176

LENGTH: 241  words


The administration of Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) has decided to remove
political parties' slogans, banners, pamphlets and flags from the premises of
hospital.

An official at the hospital told PPI that that hospital management had started
removal of political parties' slogans, banners, pamphlets and other such
materials from hospital to provide politics-free atmosphere to visiting
patients. He said political slogans, banners and flags of different political
parties could be seen at entrance gates, emergency ward, departments and walls
of the hospital, which created an ugly atmosphere for visitors.

He said prime responsibility of any public hospital was to provide better
facilities of treatment to patients, who should feel comfortable when they visit
it,  but unfortunately, the major hospital of Sindh seemed more like office of
political parties instated of health facility.

He said: 'Graffiti on hospital walls creates an ugly atmosphere for staff and
visiting patients, thus the administration has decided to remove political
slogans, banners, pamphlets and flags of political parties from the premises of
the hospital on urgent basis.'

On the other hand, the doctors, especially female staff of the hospitals, say
that political involvement in hospitals creates a strange environment,
disturbing the professional environment for them.

Medical Superintendent, Civil Hospital Karachi, Dr Tahir Aziz Shaikh, was not
available for comments.
