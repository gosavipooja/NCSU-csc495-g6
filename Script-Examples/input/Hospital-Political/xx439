Hospital failures ring no bells for politicians

SECTION: Pg. 28

LENGTH: 240  words


'BELLS toll for aging hospital'.

It was our front page headline on March 6. The story referred to patients at
Lismore Base Hospital ringing brass bells to summon nurses in one section after
the failure of the electric buzzer system.

Three weeks later we've learned the system hasn't been fixed and is still
putting patients' lives at risk.

The latest revelation to rock the hospital relates to an 87-year-old war veteran
who was forced to dial 000 from his hospital bed because he couldn't get the
attention he required.

Kevin Park said he felt like he had been 'treated like a dog' after waking in
the middle of the night with his chest covered in liquid.

Although he raised an overworked nurse once with his brass bell, he was left
alone in his bed for another three quarters of an hour and flew into a panic.

He dialled his wife's number with his mobile phone and then called 000 in a
desperate attempt to get help.

It's worth repeating. This patient was in hospital and called 000 for help.

How low do we go before we do something about our failing hospital system?

The nurses buzzers don't work, one lift is out of action and much of the
equipment is past its use by date.

Our two political leaders held a debate about health on Tuesday, so did our
local political candidates.

But the time for debating is long gone. Most fair-minded people just want
governments of all political persuasions to stop talking about it and actually
do something.
