Spine doctors in Oklahoma City and Tulsa have given more than $640,000 in
political contributions in recent years as the Oklahoma Legislature repeatedly
has taken up workers' compensation legislation that could impact their income.

An analysis of contributions by doctors associated with Oklahoma Spine Hospital
in Oklahoma City and entities they control revealed they made more than $340,000
in political contributions in recent years. Doctors associated with Tulsa Spine
and Specialty Hospital in Tulsa and entities they control gave more than
$300,000.

The largest contribution was a $30,000 donation that the Oklahoma Spine Hospital
gave to the Majority Fund last October. The Majority Fund is a political action
committee that spent more than $130,000 supporting Republican state House
candidates last October and November, records show.

Other major donations included $20,000 that the Oklahoma Spine Hospital gave to
the Oklahoma Speaker's Ball in 2012 and $13,750 that the Tulsa Spine and
Specialty Hospital gave to the Speaker's Ball from 2007 through 2012. The
Speaker's Ball is a big party hosted by the speaker of the state House of
Representatives before the start of each session.
