Pollies clash over hospital funding

PORT Stephens MP Craig Baumann has accused the state government of slashing a
quarter of Tomaree Hospital's budget, but his opponent says he is
scaremongering. Mr Baumann seized on figures showing Tomaree Community Hospital
would receive $900,000 less in the current budget than the previous $4 million
allocation. "Upgrading Tomaree Community Hospital is a priority for me. Clearly
it's not for Labor," Mr Baumann said. "This is a hospital that doesn't even have
an X-ray machine." But the government said the last allocation was inflated by
transport and leave costs no longer calculated in the same figure. "These costs
are now managed centrally in the health service and are not reported in the
2010-11 Tomaree budget figures," a Hunter New England Health spokeswoman said.
"The [last] budget therefore cannot be directly compared to the quoted 2009-10
budget." Mr Baumann called the statement "figure-fudging", but Port Stephens
Labor candidate Kate Washington said he had been wilfully misleading. "There's
been no cut to the budget or fudging as suggested by Mr Baumann," she said.
"He's not interested in facts, he's interested in scaremongering."
