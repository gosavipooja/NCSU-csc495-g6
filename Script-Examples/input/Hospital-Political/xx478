KANNUR: The strike by the nurses at Speciality Hospital here has intensified
with support flowing in from political parties.

While the SFI organized a protest march to the hospital, the DYFI said in a
statement that the arrest of the nurses on Tuesday was not justified and the
hospital management is trying to suppress the strike with the help of police.
The Congress has supported the nurses and asked the management to settle the
issue amicably.

The march by SFI witnessed some unruly scenes as the protesters entered the
hospital premises by breaking the police cordon. The nurses were arrested and
removed from the venue on Tuesday, which helped them garner more support. The
nurses in the private hospitals in Kannur, Kasaragod and Wayanad observed black
day on Wednesday in protest against the police action.

Another round of talks will be held on Thursday at labour office here in the
presence of regional conciliation officer E Venu, said the representatives of
the striking nurses.
