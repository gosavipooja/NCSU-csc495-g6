TUTH administration

LENGTH: 230  words


I would like to write something being a worker at the Tribhuvan University
Teaching Hospital. We employees were very happy when Prof. Dr. Koirala had
arrived in capacity of director of the Hospital. Like the saying, "name of the
person who does", I have heard that the Kathmandu municipality is removing the
hoarding boards to keep the valley clean.

But if any municipality had come that would remove the political hoarding board
of the University, Nepalese people would have received something. Prof. Dr.
Koirala, who was made a victim of such hoarding board, has resigned. He is
taking rest. It needs not mentioning the amount of support of the people and the
employees.

The Teaching Hospital is under a single autonomy. What is the reason for
constructing buildings in the names of leaders of various political parties? We
have not been able to understand. There is B.P Koirala Eye Hospital, Ganeshman
Singh nose, ear, neck Hospital, Manmohan Hospital, Suresh Wagle Cancer Hospital
have been build and are in operation.

Were these buildings created by the money from the pockets of this people with
these names? Is there a law in T.U that anyone can do anything? Why do we need
to publicize it with a hoarding board? I cannot understand. Why has Prof. Dr.
Bhagwan Koirala, a person like you and me, taking a defeatist path so soon? you
must fight and we employees are all with you.
