Health secretary backs Royal ...

HEALTH secretary Andrew Lansley has revealed why the government gave the
go-ahead to rebuilding the Royal Liverpool Hospital.

Mr Lansley visited Liverpool just a week after it was announced the pounds 451m
project was taken off ministers' spending cuts hit list.

He said officials believed a new Royal would prompt economic growth in the city.

After meeting senior officials at the hospital, he told the ECHO: "This was a
project which was viable and it was a necessity from the point of view of the
NHS trust.

"If they did not have a new building, the only alternative was to have a major
refurbishment, which would have been immensely disruptive and time-consuming.

"Looking at the projects which had been approved since the start of the year, we
had to see which were value for money and needed to go ahead.

"This hospital is clearly one which can make economic growth and this is an
opportunity to go beyond what is currently here. The Royal Liverpool Hospital is
a place where we can have leading science, along with leading engineering, and
that is important for economic growth."

Tony Bell, Royal chief executive, added: "We were delighted to welcome the
secretary of state to the Royal and talk to him about our plans for the new
hospital, which he confirmed last week.

"The new Royal will be a great boost for the city's vision, providing not only a
world-class hospital but a biocampus which will bring together academia,
industry and healthcare into a major health science research hub."

Mr Lansley would not be drawn on whether Alder Hey children's hospital would
secure its own funding.

He said: "I have recently been to Alder Hey and they are proceeding with their
plans. They are not asking me for approval.

"I understand how much people value the care they get at Alder Hey and some of
the difficulties the staff are working with."
