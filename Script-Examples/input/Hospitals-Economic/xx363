DATELINE: Kuala Lumpur


KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Private hospitals have to be more realistic in their
pricing of services as people can now make a choice between private or
public hospitals.

Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said today the
Ministry had steadily increased the number of government hospitals
nationwide to better serve the public.

"We received reports that the hospitals were visited by many patients
and the hospitals offered good services which were very much in demand.

"In times of economic slowdown, the public will look for places where
they can save money and still get good services," she told reporters at
the Parliament lobby here.

"They can now choose between the two sectors as both offer the same
level of quality in their services."

She also advised private hospitals to be more cost effective when
managing their resources and be more cost competitive.

Siti Zaharah also said the trend of private healthcare institutions
offering government hospital employees better salaries was no longer so
because of the economic slowdown.

"Private institutions can no longer offer lucrative salaries and
benefits particularly during these trying times.

"They used to offer a more competitive salary scale but now it is time
for them to be practical.

"At the same time, we are trying to create better synergy between the
private and government hospitals," she said.

"However, cost control is not within the Government's responsibility
alone ... it depends also on market forces, quality services and cost."
