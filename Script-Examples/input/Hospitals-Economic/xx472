NONPROFITS STEP INTO SPOTLIGHT AS ECONOMIC DRIVER

They boast billions in revenues and assets and employ tens of thousands in the
Tampa Bay area. Yet they rarely are considered real players in the regional
economy.

"They" are thousands of nonprofit organizations, some of them giants, including
major area health care systems, universities and human services groups. And they
would like a little more economic respect.

"If I say I work for a nonprofit, faces glaze over and people say, 'Oh, that's
nice,'" says Grace Armstrong, who heads the Nonprofit Leadership Center of Tampa
Bay. "If I say I am the CEO of a nonprofit, they say, 'Oh, that must be nice.'"

Trying to counter the notion of nonprofits as lightweights, Armstrong's group
released a detailed, 24-page economic impact study of the 100 largest of the
3,694 nonprofit organizations in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. The results
were posted Thursday on the Leadership Center's website
(nonprofitleadershipcenter.com).

The findings are muscular, and reinforce the contention of nonprofits that they
are a powerful but often overlooked piece of the Tampa Bay economy.

For example: The top 100 nonprofit organizations alone have 86,057 employees in
the work force in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. This represents 9.3
percent of the total work force in these counties.

And that does not include the other 3,594 (though smaller) nonprofits not
counted in the study.

"It's time," Armstrong argues, "to take nonprofits more seriously."

Not that nonprofits have proved invulnerable to the severe downturn in recent
years. Armstrong is the first to admit her nonprofit and many others - just like
their for-profit brethren - took serious hits in 2009 and 2010. More than a
third cut staff in 2009.

The Nonprofit Leadership Center, whose mission includes training nonprofit
directors to be more adept board members, suffered a 25 percent loss to its
already modest funding in 2009. It has taken time for that to be rebuilt.

Many nonprofits in the arts world now say they are recovering from the downturn
with funding starting to return to pre-recession levels. But human services
nonprofits - those dealing with domestic violence, the homeless and food banks -
are struggling to keep up with the high demand perpetuated by high unemployment
and foreclosures.

According to this economic impact study, based on revenues and assets, the
largest Hillsborough-Pinellas nonprofits are dominated by area hospital systems.
The biggest of all is the nonprofit known as Florida Health Sciences Center Inc.
We know it as Tampa General Hospital, with just under $1 billion in revenues and
just over $1 billion in assets.

Not far behind in revenues is St. Joseph's Hospital, based in Tampa but part of
the regional Baycare Health System in Clearwater. And No. 2 in assets, behind
Tampa General, is the Shriner's Hospital for Children in Tampa.

Outside of health care, the big area nonprofits range from the University of
Tampa ($164 million by revenue, $313 million in assets) and the University of
South Florida Foundation Inc. Sam & Martha Gibbons Alumni Center (whose assets
are $462 million) to the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund ($109 million
in assets) and the organ donation organization LifeLink Foundation ($108
million).

Some of the best-known area nonprofits by name place lower in the rankings.
Tampa's Metropolitan Ministries ranks 49th in assets with just $12 million, and
$13 million in revenues, among Hillsborough nonprofits. The nonprofit has
increased its appeals to individuals as other sources of funding have become
tighter.

St. Petersburg's Museum of Fine Arts is tops among art nonprofits among Pinellas
nonprofits, ranking 21st in assets with $47 million and 88th in revenues with
about $3 million.

Of course, if nonprofits want to share more of the economic spotlight with
for-profit businesses, they will find they also share the financial severity of
these times. And they are about to bump into another big distraction to donors:
the 2012 political elections. This may affect how people use their discretionary
income.

Of the two counties, Armstrong says Hillsborough nonprofits are more stressed,
mostly because they have encountered more kids and younger families in economic
need.

According to "Giving USA," the annual estimate of American philanthropy, the
slow national economic recovery likely will spell trouble for charity
fundraising until at least 2016. The report was issued earlier in the summer.

Contributions rose just 2.1 percent in 2010 after consecutive declines of 6.2
percent in 2009 and 7 percent in 2008. Those are the deepest drops in the
history of the 56-year-old study by Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy.

So, nonprofits, welcome to a bit more of the economic spotlight. And, by the
way, brace yourselves.
