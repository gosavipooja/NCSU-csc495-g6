After 22 months of negotiations, registered nurses at St. John's Mercy Medical
Center in Creve Coeur authorized their union Wednesday night to give notice of
an economic action against the hospital.

That action could mean a call for a community boycott of the hospital, a work
slowdown, a work stoppage, a refusal to work overtime or other actions.

In a series of three meetings at Queeny Park on Wednesday that were closed to
the news media, nurse negotiators sought the authority to call for an "economic
action" against St. John's, one of the area's largest hospitals. The three
meetings yielded about a 91 percent approval of authorizing the notice of an
economic action, union officials said. About 700 attended the meetings.

In a separate issue, hospital administrators confirmed Wednesday that nurses
opposed to the union were in the early stages of an effort to decertify United
Food and Commercial Workers Local 655 as the collective bargaining agent for the
approximately 1,500 registered nurses at St. John's.

The hospital said in a statement issued Wednesday that both sides have been
working hard and in good faith to reach agreement and negotiations are
continuing.

Hospital spokeswoman Amy Zimmerman said she would not comment on the vote to
authorize the notice until the hospital had been formally notified of the vote
by the union.
