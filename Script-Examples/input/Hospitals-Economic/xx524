The still-shaky economy is pushing back to 2012 the construction of the $145
million Shriners Hospital for Children planned for a site near the Washington
University medical complex.

Hospital officials said in April that they were going ahead with the project in
2010 after postponing it in 2009 because the economic downturn had hurt the
Shriners' endowment fund.

But the hospital's administrator, John Gloss, said Thursday that the fraternal
organization will not fund the project until next November, with construction to
begin the following year.

Gloss said funding the project next year is a Shriners priority.

Planned for a 3.75-acre site at 4400 Clayton Avenue is a seven-story, 40-bed
acute care children's hospital. Included in the plan are four operating rooms
and 30 examination rooms.

The hospital in the Central West End will replace the current Shriners Hospital
on Lindbergh Boulevard in Frontenac. Once the hospital moves, the Shriners
organization will put up the Frontenac property for sale.

The Missouri Health Facilities Review Committee is likely to consider in April
the Shriners' fourth extension of the state's approval to build the hospital.
The committee issued its first "certificate of need" for the project in 2008.
