May 22--Mercy Health Partners laid off 13 people at two regional medical
facilities this week as a result of the weak economy.

The consortium operates Mercy Hospital in Scranton and Mercy Special Care
Hospital in Nanticoke.

"It's a difficult time for our economy, and we have to be smarter for our
businesses," said Elizabeth Leo, vice president of human resources at Mercy
Hospital.

The layoffs took place on Tuesday, and hospital officials on Thursday said
declining revenues and an increase in unreimbursed care led to the furloughs.
The action affected people in ancillary care and office positions. Mercy employs
about 1,400 people regionally.

Last month, Community Medical Center cited the economic downturn when it laid
off 10 employees and reassigned 14 others. In January, Wilkes-Barre General
Hospital laid off 15 employees permanently and 20 temporarily.
