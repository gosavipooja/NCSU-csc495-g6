New York insurers seeking doctors for medical home initiative

MVP Health Care/Preferred Care and Excellus BlueCross BlueShield are recruiting
primary care physicians in the Rochester, N.Y., area for a three-year medical
home initiative.

Up to 20 physicians who already use electronic medical records will be accepted
into the program and will receive funds for start-up costs and the salary of a
care manager. Physicians who are chosen will also be eligible for enhanced
reimbursements.

Each practice's care manager will work with physicians to coordinate the care of
patients with chronic conditions. Physicians also will be able to schedule fewer
patients per day, allowing more time with each patient.

More Pennsylvania hospitals feeling economic pain

The economic climate for general, acute-care hospitals in Pennsylvania has
gotten worse since December 2008, according to a survey released March 12 by the
Hospital & Healthsystem Assn. of Pennsylvania.

Almost 95% of the hospitals now say the recession has affected their financial
projections for the current fiscal year. This has caused 84% to reduce or
consider reducing staff, up from 62%. Also, 88% reduced capital spending for
building improvements, renovations or new equipment.

According to the survey: 59% saw a moderate-to-significant increase in uninsured
patients or patients needing financial help, 53% reported a
moderate-to-significant decrease in admissions, and 53% reported a
moderate-to-significant decrease in elective procedures. These were up from 50%,
49% and 43%, respectively.
