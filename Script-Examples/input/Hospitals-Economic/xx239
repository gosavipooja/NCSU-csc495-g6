Jan. 21--JOHNSTOWN -- Decreasing patient volume and loss of investment income
during the current economic downturn prompted layoff notices for 47 Memorial
Medical Center employees today.

Layoffs hit management and employees in support areas and did not include
hospital nursing staff, the hospital announced.

"Careful planning and much thought went into this process and our goal was to
maintain as many jobs as possible while meeting our fiscal responsibilities in
this unprecedented economic environment," hospital President Steve Tucker said
in the press release.

The cutback represents just more than 1 percent of Memorial's 3,700 employees.

Severance packages, counseling and help with finding another job is being
offered to affected employees. Some may be able to take new positions within the
Conemaugh Health System.
