Hospitals ask for $300 million fix

   Ontario hospitals struggling with funding cuts, a massive restructuring and
rising salaries have asked the province for $300 million in aid.

They're also planning an emergency summit next month to discuss the financial
crunch.

Hospitals ran up total deficits of $113 million in 1996-97, a 60 per cent
increase from the year before, according to the Ontario Hospital Association.

The association has requested a $300 million "stabilization fund" from the
government to help those and other institutions short of cash, says spokesperson
Sam Galati.

"More and more hospitals are going into the red," Galati said in an interview.

Health Minister Elizabeth Witmer said she hadn't seen the proposal but will meet
association representatives this month.

The government-appointed Health Services Restructuring Commission has ordered
dozens of hospitals merged or closed in a process it says should reduce overhead
costs and eventually leave more money for patient care.

But the Conservatives have already forced hospitals to make cuts, reducing their
grants by more than $600 million over the last two years.

The government put off a third year of cuts. But Galati said a funding freeze
translates into a cut of 4.5 per cent because of inflation, wage increases and
ballooning populations in some areas.
