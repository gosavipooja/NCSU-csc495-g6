Hospital trust boosts local economy

LENGTH: 237  words


WIGAN hospitals could be making the local economy millions of pounds by being a
foundation trust according to new research.

Wrightington Wigan Leigh NHS Foundation Trust (WWL) which runs all three
hospital sites in the borough benefit from being a foundation trust which means
that they have a significant amount of managerial and financial freedom when
compared to NHS hospital trusts.

Research to examine the economic benefit of foundation trust hospitals has
concluded that nationally they deliver £30 billion in economic value annually,
and in the North West they deliver £5.5 billion which is more than any other
region in the UK, providing a much needed boost to the regional economy.

The report The economic and social value of foundation trusts' published by
Barclays and the Foundation Trust Network (FTN) sets out for the first time the
economic and social value generated by foundation trusts and the positive effect
that the hospital has above and beyond their critical role in healthcare.

The Bridgewater Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides community nursing
and other services in the borough is in the process of applying to become a
foundation trust.

Chris Hopson, Chief Executive, FTN, said: "In the current economic climate, it
has never been more important to capture and share the full value of the
foundation trust model in local communities, including the economic investment
made in local areas."
