Korea to allow foreign hospitals in free zones

LENGTH: 287 words


The government will revise health and welfare regulations to enable foreign
hospitals to set up operations in free economic zones, the Ministry of Knowledge
Economy said Wednesday.

The ministry said that concerned ministries including the Ministry of Health and
Welfare and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance have agreed to make the changes
in response to the Incheon Free Economic Zone Authority's requests.

With the ministries reaching an agreement on the issue, the Ministry of
Knowledge Economy plans to begin preparations for the enactment of the revised
regulations this week. However, the ministry said that the schedule will be
finalized after the National Assembly approves the revised Special Act on
Designation and Management of Free Economic Zones and the bill for introducing a
special act on foreign medical services providers is currently moored at the
parliament.

According to the IFEZ, negotiations to have a foreign hospital establish
operations in the Songdo area of the special economic zone have fallen apart
twice due to delays in revising related laws. With negotiations with a third
hospital set to end at the end of the year, the process could be stalled for the
third time if revisions are not quickly made, the IFEZ said.

The nation has pushed for the introduction of high-end international hospitals
in the free economic zones since 2003.

In 2009, Incheon signed a trilateral memorandum of understanding with Seoul
National University and the United States' Johns Hopkins Medicine International
to build a world-class hospital and life medical research center in Songdo. But
the project stalled as the nation stopped short of approving related bills and
regulations.
