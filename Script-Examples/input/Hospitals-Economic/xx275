EDMOND - Construction on one new Edmond hospital is expected to begin soon,
while another medical property is still in the planning stages.

The construction of Integris Edmond Health Medical Center is scheduled to begin
this summer. Ground was broken in October, but building was delayed because of
the economic downturn, hospital President Avilla T. Williams said.

The $90 million project, which will be on the east side of Interstate 35 between
Second and 15th streets, will feature 40 beds and will give Edmond its first
hospital birth unit since Renaissance Women's Hospital closed in 2005.

While it is too early to begin hiring, Williams said they're currently working
to establish relationships with physicians in the area.

Mercy Health Center hasn't decided what to do with 25 acres of property it
purchased on Sooner Road between 15th and 33rd streets.

"Nothing has really changed. We're still in the plans," Mercy spokeswoman Nancy
Woodard said.

Edmond Medical Center, meanwhile, continues to serve Edmond with 94 beds for
medical, surgical and outpatient care as well as an intensive care/coronary care
unit. The hospital also has a 17-bed geropsychiatric unit, the Autumn Life
Center.

Owned by the Hospital Corp. of America, Edmond Medical employs about 550 people.
It is Edmond's fourth-largest employer, according to the Edmond Economic
Development Authority.

Recently the hospital began offering community programs.

"Right now, there's a program we do with junior high kids called Health Explore
to get them interested in medical careers," said spokeswoman Leslie Buford.

Other programs the group is offering include Adopt-a-School and offering tours
for new patients.
