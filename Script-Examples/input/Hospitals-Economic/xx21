Sept. 30--MUNSTER -- In an economic impact report released this week, Franciscan
Physicians Hospital announced it has a $57 million impact on the community.

"Franciscan Physicians Hospital is critical to the economic viability of our
community," the report said. "(It) is a major source of employment and purchaser
of goods and services, while providing health care that allows people to be
productive citizens."

The 63-bed hospital, which opened in 1994, became part of the Franciscan
Alliance in 2007. Formally a for-profit, physician-hospital partnership, the
hospital paid $911,118 in sales tax and property tax revenue.

"We feel it's important to educate the community on the impact we have,"
hospital President Barb Greene said. "Without us here, that economic base would
be gone."

Last year, the hospital had 857 inpatient visits and 7,699 outpatient visits.
The hospital provides 200 jobs to the community including 151 health care
professionals. The total payroll for the hospital is $17.7 million and the
report indicates employees invest that money back in the local economy by buying
items such as groceries, clothing and rent creating about 90 additional jobs in
the community.

The report also states the hospital spent about $38.9 million in supply
purchases and just less than $1 million in capital spending.

Greene said the final sentence of the report, which asks for continued support
and investment from legislators and Congress, is related to the health care
reform legislation signed in March 2010.

"A lot has been delegated back to the states," Greene said. "We want to continue
to have high-quality care."
