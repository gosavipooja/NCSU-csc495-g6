Impact of MCG hits $820 million

The Medical College of Georgia's hospitals and clinics pumped more than $820
million into the area economy in 2004, according to a recent report by the
Georgia Hospital Association.

The report showed that MCG-affiliated facilities had direct expenditures of $333
million. When combined with an output multiplier developed by the U.S.
Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, the total economic impact
of the hospital was more than $820 million.

This multiplier considers the ripple effect of direct hospital expenditures on
other sectors of the economy.
