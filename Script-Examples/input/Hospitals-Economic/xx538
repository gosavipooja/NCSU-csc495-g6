HOSPITAL REPORT SHOWS HOW IT BOOSTS ECONOMY

SANTA CLARITA -- Heading for tonight's showdown in its disputed plan to expand,
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital issued a report Monday that shows that it
generates millions of dollars for the city and the state and also provides
hundreds of local jobs.

The report by the nonprofit Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. says
the Valencia hospital paid some 2,400 employees -- including contract workers
and other related jobs -- $133 million in wages. The figures are from 2005.

The study was released in time for tonight's meeting before the Santa Clarita
Planning Commission at which Newhall Memorial will present revised plans for its
proposed 916,611-square-foot expansion.

``We are an extensive part of the economic health of the community and wanted to
give the commission the benefit of the information in the study,'' hospital
spokeswoman Andy Bogdan wrote in a press release.

The hospital spent $30.9 million in 2005 on services, supplies and equipment,
according to its study, and generated a total of $9.8 million in taxes.

Neighbors objected when the hospital announced plans for a four-story office
building and a five-level parking structure within 50 feet of its property line
with homes. Modifications call for buffers of up to 96 to 138 feet between
neighbors and the new buildings. In addition, two three-story buildings are
planned and the parking structure has been downsized and moved back on the
hospital property.

Newhall Memorial's planned $64 million construction project would pump $136
million into the regional economy and create 920 jobs with wages totalling $37
million. About $3.9 million in state income and sales taxes would be realized.

City planners recommend that the five-member Planning Commission review the
revisions, take public comments and continue the hearing to Oct. 17.
