Hospitals are economic engines

 Washington: American Hospital Association has issued the following news
release:



 Hospitals' contribution to their communities extends far beyond their role as
health care cornerstones. As the most recent update of our annual report on
hospitals' economic impact makes clear, they also are economic anchors,
providing the stability and growth that contributes greatly to the financial
health of the communities they serve.





 The health care field has traditionally been an economic lynchpin for the
nation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that health care as a
whole added an average of 35,000 jobs per month in 2016.



 We studied economic activity in 2015, and found hospitals specifically employed
more than 5.7 million, were one of the top sources of private-sector jobs and
spent nearly $852 billion on goods and services from other businesses.



 Those goods and services created additional economic value for the community by
supporting 16 million total jobs and more than $2.8 trillion in economic
activity. This translates into hospitals supporting one of every nine jobs in
the U.S.



 Hospitals provide vital high-quality health care services to millions of people
each year and support a healthy, productive workforce. But what's not well
enough known is how all that quality health care acts as an engine driving
trillions of dollars of economic activity in communities across the nation.
