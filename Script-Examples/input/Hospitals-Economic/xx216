The vice president of the Committee for the Integration of Closed Health
Programs (Ceifas), Joilson Rodrigues Ferreira, delivered to the president of the
Justice Department's Economic Defense Council (Cade) an accusation against
hospitals overcharging health insurance programs. According to Joilson, in a
stable economy with low levels of inflation, as in Brazil, hospitals are
charging "incompatible" prices for material used by patients. He accused the
hospitals of charging an average 35% fee above the normal price of the products.
A spokesman for the Secretariat of Economic Defense (SDE) said it will
investigate whether the hospitals are charging abusive prices.  (Gazeta
