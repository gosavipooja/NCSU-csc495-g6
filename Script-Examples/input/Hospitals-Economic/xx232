Hospitals provide an intangible service to the community by caring for the sick.
But they are also an important component of our economy - something people tend
to forget.

A new study by the Healthcare Association of New York State serves as a good
reminder. The study, based on a model developed by the federal Bureau of
Economic Analysis, reports that Long Island's 26 hospitals contribute $10.1
billion to the region in terms of wages, supplies, taxes and the ripple effect
of that spending. Local hospitals are often the largest employers in their
communities - collectively paying the wages of 43,000 people on Long Island.
Hospitals, clearly, are an important part of a healthy economy.
