ABSTRACT

Lester and Sue Smith, a Houston couple, donated money to help a local
health-care institution better serve its outpatients.

FULL TEXT

How much: $15-million pledge

Who gave it: Lester and Sue Smith, through their foundation. Mr. Smith is head
of Smith Interests, a Houston company that owns gas, minerals, oil, and timber
businesses.

Who got it: Harris County Hospital District Foundation, in Houston, the
fund-raising arm for the public hospital.

Purpose: An ambulatory-care center for outpatients that will be named after the
couple.

Why the donor gave: Mr. Smith, a cancer survivor, says that his Jewish faith
guides his giving. The sluggishness of the economic recovery also prompted his
donation. "These are hard economic times," he says. "There are people who had
health coverage and lost it, and now they don't have anything." With his gift,
he says, more poor people "can go and still get great medical care. Now, that's
a neat deal."
