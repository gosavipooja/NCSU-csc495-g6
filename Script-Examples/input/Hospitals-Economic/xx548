A Historic Aberdeen property is set to come to life again after years of disuse.
The 150-year-old Elmhill House, part of the B-listed Royal Cornhill Hospital
designed by William Ramage and Archibald Simpson, has been transformed from its
bomb-damaged state.

And later this month new apartments will be released for sale in the
conservation area development.

Many of its original features have been retained and incorporated into
contemporary accommodation.

The development is a joint venture between the Premier Property Group - an arm
of Murray International Holdings controlled by David Murray - and The Burrell
Company, specialists in urban regeneration.

It is the second hospital development in Aberdeen for the pairing, Premier
Burrell, which has also turned the former City Hospital site into houses and
flats.

Thirty-one two and three-bedroom apartments have been created at Elmhill House
and will go on sale on March 31.

Selling agents Hutcheon Rattray and Co have no price list available for the
properties.
