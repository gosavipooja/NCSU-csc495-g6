THE site for a new hospital for west Birmingham was revealed today.

Industrial land in Grove Lane, Smethwick, has been earmarked for the project,
bringing a pounds 366 million investment for the area and 1,000 jobs.

A public consultation is under way until February on the plans to close City
Hospital, in Winson Green, and Sandwell Hospital, in West Bromwich, and replace
them with the new building.

Sandwell and West Birmingham Trust bosses said today that if plans went ahead,
the current hospital sites would be sold off and redeveloped, mainly as housing.

A spokeswoman said:

"The hospital would be one of Sandwell's most significant development projects,
and would bring forward under-used, brownfield land for redevelopment.

"Grove Lane is the preferred location because of its central location on the
Birmingham and Sandwell border, its accessibility for patients and emergency
vehicles, and because of the regeneration and economic development benefits.

"This site would provide a significant boost to regeneration and economic
development in the area, creating investment of up to pounds 366 million in the
development of a new hospital.

"It could result in approximately 1,000 jobs."

Construction of the hospital is forecast to start in January 2010, with the
opening in 2013.
