Feb. 25--Norman Regional Health System will reduce its workforce by 70
positions, hospital officials announced Tuesday.

The announcement came after the health system's leadership team, in a scheduled
meeting, finalized the actions of their economic recovery plan.

This plan is in response to current economic conditions that are affecting
healthcare and other businesses both in the state and nation.

Also implemented will be a reduction in workweek hours resulting in additional
salary savings requiring no further reductions in force.

They have also identified an additional $5 million in non-salary savings for the
remainder of the fiscal year, ending June 30, 2009. Hospital officials earlier
this week cited lower patient revenue and higher accounts receivables affecting
their budget.
