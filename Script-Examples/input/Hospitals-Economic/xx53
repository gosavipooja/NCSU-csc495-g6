HIGHLIGHT: This study explored the relation between state medical liability
reform measures, hospital malpractice costs, and hospital solvency. It suggests
that state malpractice caps are desirable but not essential for improved
hospital financial solvency or viability.

TEXT:
 [*127]  Medical liability remains a major concern among U.S. physicians, and
according to the American Medical Association (AMA) the United States is
currently experiencing its third full-blown medical liability crisis with many
physicians limiting their practices as a result of rising malpractice costs.  n1
The AMA, many in the medical community, and several prominent politicians
including former president George W. Bush have called for medical liability
reform including caps on non-economic damages. Some researchers argue that the
medical liability crisis has been overdrawn. Several studies have shown that the
vast majority of patients injured through medical malpractice do not sue, that
the insurance cycle is likely a major contributor to rising malpractice
insurance premiums, and that defensive medicine likely plays a minor role in
rising health care costs.  n2 Further, evidence shows that malpractice damage
caps may lead to a crossover effect where juries increase the amount of economic
damages they award to offset limitations in non-economic damages available.  n3
However, studies from the 1970s and 1980s  n4 as well as more recent studies  n5
have suggested that specific reforms including caps on noneconomic damages
correlate with lower physician liability premiums. There is also evidence that
states with caps have an increased supply of physicians, especially in rural
areas.  n6 A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office states that a
[*128]  package of reforms including a $ 250,000 cap on non-economic damages
would reduce national physician premiums by 10% and would reduce health care
costs by $ 11 billion in 2009 and reduce federal deficits by $ 54 billion over
the next 10 years.  n7

   Hospitals are also affected by the malpractice crisis, and evidence suggests
that malpractice costs have forced some hospitals to limit services or close
some services altogether.  n8 Hospitals claim that rising malpractice costs,
coupled with negative Medicare and Medicaid margins, place them at financial
risk.  n9 Rural hospitals are some of the most at risk with a larger proportion
of Medicare patients, fewer patients, and relatively high fixed costs.  n10
Teaching hospitals are also at risk with a higher Medicare and Medicaid
populations and a larger share of uncompensated care.  n11 Although preliminary
evidence suggests that medical liability reform correlates with lower hospital
malpractice premiums,  n12 no published systematic review to date has examined
the association between specific state medical liability reform measures,
hospital malpractice costs, and hospital solvency. This study attempts to
explore (1) whether a correlation exists, and (2) the nature of that
correlation.

Design and Methods
Article 1
Our main source of data was the Hospital Cost Report Information Set (HCRIS)
from 1998-2003. HCRIS is publicly available hospital cost data from the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  n13 CMS requires every hospital that
receives Medicare funds to report their itemized annual costs to the agency,
using a standardized set of reporting forms. Beginning in 1996, CMS mandated all
hospitals to also report their malpractice costs including malpractice premiums,
payouts, and expenditures on self-insurance. There is a lag in hospital
reporting and report audits; consequently adequate data were available for
1998-2003. Hospitals are also required to report whether they are rural or
urban, and we used these designations to characterize the rural/urban status of
a hospital. Hospitals also are required to report whether they are engaged in
teaching. We characterized hospitals that reported they did any teaching as
teaching hospitals.

   We categorized all 50 states and the District of Columbia according to the
types of malpractice reforms enacted in the period. We reviewed the medical
liability reform statutes that were in force during the study period along with
relevant judicial opinions. We excluded data from states after the enactment of
reforms if the reforms occurred during the study period. We created ten reform
categories: (1) total damage caps; (2) caps on non-economic damages; (3) joint
and several liability; (4) collateral source rule; (5) attorney fee caps; (6)
mandatory arbitration; (7) voluntary arbitration; (8) excess coverage funds; (9)
permitted periodic payments; and (10) certificate of merit. We categorized total
damage caps (# 1) as caps of $ 500,000 or less, and caps greater than $ 500,000.
We also categorized caps on non-economic damages (# 2) as caps of $ 250,000 or
less, and caps greater than $ 250,000 (Figure 1).

   We sought to explain the following outcome measures: (1) average malpractice
costs per bed; (2) average malpractice premiums per bed; (3) average malpractice
payouts per bed; (4) average amount per bed set aside for self-insurance; and
(5) overall financial margins as a measure of solvency. Hospital data were from
an average of more than 2,000 hospitals each year over an 8-year period
(1996-2003) (N = 20,436 hospital-years). State-level data were derived for the
53 U.S. states and territories from 1996 to 2003 (N = 425 state-years). The
explanatory variables at the state-level included all 10 types of tort reform
environments, including total caps and caps on non-economic damages. Hospital
cost data for the years prior to the enactment of caps were included in the
non-cap group. We corrected for states that enacted caps during the study period
by excluding hospital cost data for these states after caps were enacted.
Explanatory variables at the hospital-level included urban/rural status,
teaching/non-teaching status, hospital organizational control, and hospital
size. The hospital cost data were annualized to account for variations in the
length and start date of fiscal years for the reporting hospitals. We also
corrected for hospitals with charitable immunity protection (Figure 2).

   We performed bivariate analysis to study the relationship between medical
malpractice reforms and our outcome measures. This was also done for specific
subsets of hospitals (rural/urban, teaching/ non-teaching). We performed
multivariate analysis with regression models to control for rural/urban,
teaching/non-teaching status as well as other reform measures that were also
part of that state's particular statute. We also performed multi-level analysis
using two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).  n14 This step-wise process
permitted more precise estimation of and accounting for effects of hospital
characteristics on hospitals' financial status, and then better control for
hospital characteristics in estimating the impact of state tort environments.

   First-level modeling represented the relationships at the hospital-level (for
example hospital organization and culture), while the second-level model
represented the influence of state-level factors (for example the environment
imposed by state tort reform legislation).

Charitable Immunity

STATES WITH CHARITABLE IMMUNITY LAWS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOSPITALS

Massachusetts. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. Ch. 231, sec. 85k. Limits liability to $
20,000 for charitable hospitals. Keene v. Brigham and Women's Hosp., Inc., 439
Mass. 223, 786 N.E.2d 824 (2003).

New Jersey. N.J. Stat.Ann. Secs. 2A:53A-7, 2A:53A-8 (Supp. 1979). Limits
liability for charitable hospitals to $ 10,000. In exploratory analysis we
considered the following outcome variables in the level-1 model: hospital
malpractice costs, hospital losses, hospital financial margins. In the
exploratory analysis we also estimated state-level coefficients and their
standard errors by regressing empirical Bayes residuals on state-level
predictors. After the exploratory analysis we selected hospital malpractice
costs as the level-1 outcome variable, and the overall model we estimated may be
represented in equation form as:

Level 1 Model (in Hospitals):
HMCost[ij] = [beta] [0j] + [beta] [1j]Urban[ij] + [beta] [2j]Teaching + [beta]
[2j]Ownership + [beta] [4j]Size[ij] + [gamma] [ij]

Level 2 Model (in States):
[beta] [0j] = [alpha] [10] + [mu] [oj]
[beta] [1j] = [alpha] [10]
[beta] [2j] = [alpha] [20]
[beta] [3j] = [alpha] [30] + [alpha] [31]StateCap[j] + [alpha] [32] # ofhosps[j]
+ [alpha] [33] #teachhosps[j]
[beta] [4j] = [alpha] [40]

Where HMCost[ij] the level-1 outcome variable, is annual hospital malpractice
costs measured as the sum of liability insurance premiums, self-insurance
premiums, and hospital losses over revenue per year; [beta] [i] (i = 0, 1 ... 4)
are level-1 coefficients which of course become the level-2 outcome variables;
[gamma] is the level-1 random effect; Urban[ij] designates hospitals in urban
communities; Ownership[ij] designates the type of hospital ownership; and
Size[ij] represents the size of the hospital (number of hospital beds). In the
state-level model, StateCapj = 1 for states with caps on damages of $ 250,000 or
less; # ofHosps[j] is the number of hospitals in the State; and # teachhosp[j]
is the number of teaching hospitals in the state.

   All the level-1 independent variables were group-centered. We used HLM
(version 6) Hierarchical Linear and Non-linear Modeling software with restricted
maximum likelihood as the method of estimation, and no weighting.  n15 The fixed
effects were estimated in regression models, and the results with robust
standard errors were reported.

Results
Nearly 40% of the states in our study had some cap on damages, 7.5% had non-
economic damage caps at $ 250,000 or less, and 5.6% had total caps at $ 500,000

[*131]  or less. Almost all the hospitals were general short-term hospitals; 62%
were urban hospitals; 31% were teaching hospitals; 63% were non-profit
hospitals; and 20% were public hospitals. There was significant variation among
states regarding the 10 reform measures studied (Table 1). Such variation and
lack of a clear unified policy among the states made further characterization
difficult.

   The average annual hospital malpractice cost was $ 5478 per bed (Table 1).
Our bivariate analysis demonstrated that average annual malpractice costs per
bed for hospitals in states with any cap was $ 4558 compared to $ 5868 for
hospitals in states with no caps. In other words average annual hospital
malpractice costs per bed were $ 1300 lower per year in states with caps
compared to those without caps. This difference was statistically significant at
a 95% significance level. Differences in the nine other studied reform measures
between states with and without such measures were not statistically
significant. No state-reform measure, including caps, was associated with
hospital financial solvency.

   States with caps of $ 500,000 on total damages had an average annual
malpractice cost per bed of $ 5,013. States with caps on non-economic damages
had average malpractice costs per bed of $ 5,012. For urban and teaching
hospitals, caps other than total caps of $ 500,000 were strongly correlated with
lower malpractice costs. The average malpractice costs per bed for urban
hospitals was significantly lower in states with non-economic damage caps of $
250,000 or less ($ 5512; 95% CI $ 5086-$ 5938), or any other cap except total
damage cap of $ 500,000 or less ($ 5606; 95% CI $ 4676-$ 6536), compared to
states with no caps ($ 7155; 95% CI $ 6664-$ 7647). The average malpractice
costs per bed for teaching hospitals was likewise significantly lower in states
with non-economic damage caps of up to $ 250,000 ($ 7417; 95% CI $ 6461-$ 8374),
and in states with any other cap except total damage cap Urban Hospital of $
500,000 ($ 6595;95% CI 5704-7486), compared to states with no caps Hospital
ownership ($ 9214; 95% CI $ 8379-$ 10,049). Similar results were found for
urban, teaching hospitals with average malpractice costs of $ 7298 (95% CI $
6300-$ 8297) in states with non-economic damage caps of $ 250,000 or less, and $
6939 (95% CI $ 5897-$ 7981) in states with any other cap except total damage
caps of $ 500,000 compared to costs of $ 9349 (95% CI $ 8444-$ 10,254) with no
caps. No significant difference was noted for rural and non-teaching hospitals
for any of the studied reform measures including caps.

   In multivariate analyses we found that caps on non-economic damages of up to
$ 250,000 were strongly correlated with lower average malpractice costs per bed
(p=0.004) but not total caps of $ 500,000 or less (p=0.105). This finding holds
true even after controlling for the urban/rural and the teaching status of a
hospital. No tort reform measures were associated with statistically significant
differences in hospital financial margins, even after controlling for urban/
rural and teaching status (Table 2).

   The results from our HLM analysis estimations with robust standard errors are
presented in Table 3. Our final model converged on the 8th iteration, with a
sigma-squared = 4,694,382 and overall reliability estimate = 0.561. The T-ratios
of all our fixed effect variables were significantly large with P-values below
0.05. At the hospital-level rural teaching hospitals are more likely to have
higher malpractice costs, and hospital malpractice costs are positively related
to the size of the hospital. Private and public hospitals are more likely to
have higher malpractice costs, compared to nonprofit hospitals. Non-economic
damage caps below $ 250,000 are associated with increased malpractice costs, as
is having relatively more teaching hospitals.

   The chi-square value for the level-2 (state-level) residual variance
significantly departs from zero (p-value = 0.000). The intra-class correlation
coefficient for the unconditional model was only 4.4%. This means that at
baseline, prior to including any predictor variables, 4.4% of the total variance
in the model

other words, the relative importance of the two levels to explain malpractice
costs may be low. When the predictor variables are included in the model, the
intra-class correlation coefficient remains low at 7.6%.

Discussion
Caps on non-economic damages are associated with significantly lower average
hospital malpractice costs per bed. In particular, the $ 250,000 cap on non-
economic damages appears to be strongly correlated with lower malpractice costs,
especially for urban and teaching hospitals. These findings may seem to conflict
with the cross-over effect noted by Sharkey.  n16 However, the Sharkey article
looked at the cross-over effect on malpractice awards, and jury behavior.
Although this effect will have broader impact, it does not directly look at
other factors that increase malpractice costs such as litigation and settlement
costs. Our study examines total malpractice costs, and this explains how our
findings differ from those of Sharkey. Other reform measures were not associated
with lower hospital malpractice costs. Our adjustments for location and teaching
status did not make the association between caps on non-economic damages go
away. Multi-level analysis suggests that a hospital's organizational control is
significantly associated with their malpractice costs. This multi-level approach
sheds new light on this issue and demonstrates the complexity of this issue. No
reform measure, including caps, was associated with improved overall financial
solvency as defined by positive financial margins.

   Financial solvency appears to be associated with other factors outside the
scope of this study. For an average hospital of 400 beds, $ 1300 per bed per
year of savings associated with non-economic damage caps would produce a
reduction in malpractice costs of $ 520,000 per year. Although this is
substantial, it does not appear to play a large part in the overall financial
success of a hospital since it does not appear to effect margins.

   The association of non-economic damage caps of $ 250,000 with lower
malpractice costs for urban and teaching hospitals but not rural and
non-teaching hospitals may be related to the acuity of illness in large teaching
centers. It also may reflect geographic

[*133]  and cultural differences in litigiousness, access to legal services, or
other factors.

   We find it more difficult to explain why caps of $ 250,000 on non-economic
damages are strongly correlated with lower malpractice costs but total caps of
up to $ 500,000 are not. Although total damage caps have often been held
unconstitutional, the caps studied have been upheld by the courts. This finding
for hospitals is different than a recent study that found that total caps and
non-economic damage caps are associated with lower malpractice premiums for
obstetricians.  n17 Our inability to find an association may be due to the
limited number of states and hospitals operating under this type of tort reform
legislation. It also may be due to differences in the ways that physicians and
hospitals are treated in the litigation process -- with hospitals having the
traditional deeper pockets from which to get the large non-economic damage
awards.

   This study adds to the growing understanding of the effects of state-based
malpractice reforms. Our evaluation of outcomes was strongly financial and shows
that specific reforms, namely payment caps, are associated with a significant
effect on hospital expenses, but without an identifiable impact on hospital
financial solvency. Applied generally, this suggests that malpractice caps are
desirable but not essential to hospital viability. This may not be true for
individual hospitals, especially since there can be wide variation in hospital
financial margins even within the same city.  n18

   Our study was limited by the small number of states that have adopted reforms
other than caps. This may have limited our capacity to find real effect. There
is significant variation among tort reform statutes that limited our ability to
categorize them. We are also constrained by the outcomes we studied. There may
be other ways to categorize hospitals that we did not consider. In addition, we
were unable to correct for hospitals that have a high proportion of independent
contractors. Since such hospitals in many jurisdictions have limited liability
for the negligence of these contractors, our study may underestimate the effects
of caps. There are non-economic outcomes, such as justice, making people whole,
apologizing for mistakes, and improving quality that may be more desirable.
Future studies will have to address these issues.
