The trust said the current economic climate will have an impact on the timing of
the disposal of the site in Saltshouse Road.

David Haire, director of business, development and strategy for the trust, said:
"We have vacated the major part of the site and are exploring disposal options.

"Within the current economic climate, disposal is not likely to be achieved in
the short term.

"We have formally declared it surplus to requirements and we are looking at how
best to dispose of it."

Mr Haire said the trust needs to ensure it gets the best value for the site.

He said: "The economic downturn will influence land sales generally and this
will impact on the timing of the disposal."

As reported in the Mail in December, X-ray and physiotherapy services will
remain at the site.

Patients were transferred from the hospital to the oncology and haematology
centre at Castle Hill Hospital in Cottingham last summer.
