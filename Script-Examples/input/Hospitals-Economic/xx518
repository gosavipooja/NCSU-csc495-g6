Old hospital remembered in booklet

SECTION: Pg. 7

LENGTH: 246 words


A book encapsulating memories of the old Frome Victoria Hospital in Park Road is
now on sale.

The booklet has been produced by a team of volunteers and hospital staff and
will raise funds for the new community hospital.

The work is not a history book as such, but an easy to browse collection of
memories of a much-loved hospital between 1901 and its replacement in 2008.
There are contributions from staff, Frome residents and volunteers past and
present.

Jan Curtis, who compiled and edited the booklet, said: "It has taken quite a
long time from the original idea since  two  printers folded due to the economic
downturn and new negotiations had to begin each time.

"The booklet was only possible due to the team's perseverance and I am so
grateful for their continued interest, especially Molly Butler and Dilys Griffin
who made sure I didn't give up on the project."

Other team members Alison Sykes, Hilary Myers and  Chris Wilson  researched the
history of the hospital and its staff. The internal and external photographs of
the Park Road hospital were taken by Peter Swietlik.

Malcolm Rice and Roger Breward shared their printing and computer knowledge to
compile the document ready for the printing process.

All profit from the sales of the booklet will be used by the Friends of Frome
Hospital for the benefit of the new hospital.

The booklet, costing Â£3.99, is on sale at Frome Community Hospital reception,
the Hunting Raven, Frome Museum and Frome Tourist Information Centre.
