EDMOND - Avilla Williams, the president of Integris Health Edmond, will talk
about the new 40-bed hospital Friday at the Edmond Economic Development
Authority monthly meeting. The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at 825 E Second St.

Work on the $94 million project has been under way since February. The
151,482-square-foot hospital is being constructed east of Interstate 35, just
north of 15th Street. It is expected to open in fall 2011.

Following the groundbreaking in the fall of 2008, construction was delayed until
now because of the economic downturn.

The acute care hospital will have 24 medical and surgical beds, six intensive
care suites, 10 women center suites, four operating suites, a full-service
emergency department and a state-of-the-art imaging center.

The women's center will give mothers an opportunity to deliver their babies
inside the city limits. Women haven't been able to have a baby in an Edmond
hospital setting since 2005, when Renaissance Women's Center closed. Edmond
Regional Medical Center, now OU Medical Center Edmond, stopped delivering babies
in 1995.
