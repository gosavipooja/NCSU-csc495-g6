THE government has approved licences for a total of 45 new private hospitals and
this will grow the number of beds at private hospitals by a third to 15,178.

As at end of 2008, Malaysia had a total of 209 registered hospitals with a total
of 11,689 beds.

"Since the implementation of the Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act
1998 and its regulations in 2006, we have received 55 applications for the
establishment of new private hospitals, of which 45 have been approved," the
Minister of Health Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said.

The 45 hospitals have a total of 3,489 beds.

"...the number of private hospitals operating in the country has increased
almost two fold from 135 at the end of December 2001 to 209 by the end of
December 2008," he added.

Liow was speaking to reporters yesterday following the launch of "Rebirth of
Pantai" for Pantai Holdings Bhd.

On whether the healthcare sector can expect anything from the second stimulus
package, Liow said there will be some goodies in store to boost medical tourism
and training for nurses.

"We should prepare for medical tourism and take it to the next level ... we
should promote this sector further," he said, adding that medical tourism has
been identified as a key sector to generate economic growth.

A second stimulus package to boost the economy will be announced on March 10
2009, adding to the RM7 billion stimulus package announced last November.
