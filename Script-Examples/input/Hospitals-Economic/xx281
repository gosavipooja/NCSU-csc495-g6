S. Koreans Permitted Medical Treatment at Foreign Hospitals in Free Economic
Zones

LENGTH: 141 words


   The Finance and Economy Committee of the National Assembly on Wednesday
passed a bill which enables South Koreans to receive medical treatment at
foreign hospitals in free economic zones.

Under the bill, a foreign hospital established in a free economic zone is
allowed to operate as a business corporation. The bill also aims to loosen the
regulations governing the construction of foreign hospitals in free economic
zones to promote foreign investments in the country.

Some members of the committee, including Sim Sang-jeong of the Democratic Labor
Party, objected to the bill, arguing the bill could ''undermine the foundation
of the nation's medical system as it would lure the wealthy away from domestic
health insurance.''The government plans to build two large foreign hospitals in
free economic zones in Inchon by 2008.
