AREA HOSPITALS TO TRIM LEADERSHIP POSITIONS;

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Holy Family Hospital are eliminating
19 management positions this month as broad economic problems reach area
hospitals.

Dr. Andrew Agwunobi, chief executive officer at Providence's operations in
Eastern Washington, said last month that layoffs were likely. The region's
largest private employer is bracing for deep cuts in state-funding - a source of
revenue that pays a big part of the overall bill for patients needing hospital
care.

Staffing accounts for 52 percent of the hospital's overall budget and Agwunobi
said the 19 leadership jobs are the first of "what could be ongoing reductions
necessary to weather the tumultuous economic environment."

Executives are consulting with outside firm Wellspring Partners to review
hospital operations and costs. As the results come in, the hospital has been
making changes to curb costs such as leaving positions dark, freezing top
management salaries and reducing discretionary spending.

Severance pay and career transition aid are being made available. A recall
program has been installed to give hire-back priority to those laid off.
