Cho Ray Viet Nam-Japan Friendship Hospital Development Project

LENGTH: 493  words


Project details : Continue achieving sustainable economic growth, the investment
environment must be developed through infrastructure improvements, the
macroeconomy stabilized through economic structural and administrative reforms,
and international competitiveness strengthened. Furthermore, in order to promote
social development with balanced economic development, it is necessary to
alleviate the effects of and adapt to climate change, as well as addressing
vulnerabilities by improving the level of public sanitation that has worsened
with urbanization, and strengthening the health care system.


The public health care system of Vietnam has a three-level structure, in which
communes and districts are at the first level, provinces at the second level and
the nation at the third level. Top-rank hospitals not only receive patients
referred from lower-level hospitals, but also bear the responsibility of
providing guidance and support to lower-level hospitals. Given this system in
which lower-level hospitals refer patients to a higher-level hospital when
unable to provide proper treatment, a large number of patients seek treatment at
higher-level hospitals in cities without visiting the health care institutions
at the lower-level, resulting in a lower service quality and dysfunction in the
health care system overall. Even at Cho Ray Hospital, the top-level medical
center in southern Vietnam located in Ho Chi Minh City, the hospital bed
utilization rate stays consistently at about 140 percent, further lowering the
service quality and causing dysfunction.
This project will construct a new Viet Nam-Japan Friendship Cho Ray Hospital as
a second Cho Ray Hospital to expand the number of third-level hospital beds,
alleviate the overload, promote advanced medical and preventative health care,
and strengthen the functions as a base for health care human resource
development and training, including for lower-level hospitals. The project will
also strengthen hospital quality management, thereby contributing to the
enhancement of the health care system in Vietnam. The loan funds will be
allocated to constructing the hospital facilities, installing the medical device
and health care information system, and consulting services.
