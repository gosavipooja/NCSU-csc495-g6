HERSHEY (AP) -- Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center is delaying
construction of a new children's hospital because of concerns over the global
economic crisis.

The center's chief executive officer, Dr. Harold Paz, said yesterday the
economic climate hampers the hospital's ability to borrow money for the $235
million children's hospital project.

Groundbreaking had been scheduled for January, pending the approval of
architectural designs and financing plans by the hospital's board and Penn
State's trustees.

Paz says officials are continuing to raise money for the children's hospital. He
says they've secured $58 million in private donations so far.

Paz says the delay won't affect several other expansion projects already in
progress at the medical center.
