More than 80 percent of Pennsylvania's hospitals are considering layoffs -- if
they haven't initiated them already -- due to the national economic downturn,
according to a new statewide survey by the Hospital and Healthsystem Association
of Pennsylvania.

The survey, conducted earlier this month, also shows that "the economic
environment for the state's general acute-care hospitals has not improved, and
in some areas worsened," according to hospital association officials, who warned
of the consequences of reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments, something that
has been proposed.

"Cutting payments to hospitals under these programs jeopardizes the ability of
hospitals to meet all patient and community health care needs," said Carolyn
Scanlan, president and chief executive officer, in a release. "It also
undermines the very economic stability of many Pennsylvania communities."

Responding hospitals reported a slight increase in uninsured or financially
strapped patients and a continued decrease in admissions and elective
procedures.

Nearly 90 percent said they'd reduced capital spending for building
improvements, renovations or new equipment.

The association represents about 250 hospitals.
