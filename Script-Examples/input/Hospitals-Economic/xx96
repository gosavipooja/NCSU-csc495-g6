Hospitals follow through on cost trimming, job cuts

HIGHLIGHT:Â An industry report suggests job growth is flat and more CEOs are
getting requests from doctors for financial help.


With a growing number of people losing employer-sponsored insurance, the
belt-tightening moves hospital executives talked about in the fall as possibly
necessary to survive the recession have become reality. Demand for subsidized or
free services is increasing, but budgets are being slashed. The hospital job
sector, which has long been buffered from economic swings, is feeling the pinch.

Those are among the conclusions of a report issued April 27 by the American
Hospital Assn., based on a survey taken in March.

"Community need for care remains high and, in these tough times, communities
turn to their local hospital," said AHA President and CEO Rich Umbdenstock. "
Hospitals are walking a tightrope, trying to balance the growing needs of their
communities with today's economic challenges."

The AHA last queried chief executive officers of its member institutions on this
subject in November 2008, and plans to survey them quarterly to determine the
impact of the recession on hospitals.

The organization's first inquiry of 736 CEOs revealed 59% were considering or
already cutting administrative costs and 27% were looking at or actually
reducing staff. This more recent questionnaire filled out by 1,078 CEOs
indicated that 90% made some sort of change, such as cutting administrative
expenses, reducing staff, eliminating some services, debating a merger or
divesting assets.

The prior survey also found that 56% were reconsidering spending money on
expanding capacity or other renovations. Approximately 45% were questioning
whether to invest in clinical technology or equipment.

In March, 77% actually did reduce capital spending and 46% scaled back ongoing
projects.

The more recent survey also found 65% had a moderate or significant decrease in
total margins, which includes investment income, and 57% had a moderate or
significant drop in operating margins, a ratio that involves only revenue and
expenses associated with patient care.

The concern is that hospitals may not be able to serve their communities either
because they don't have the most up-to-date technology, or they are forced to
close their doors.

"The impact of the economic downturn is increasing on hospitals," said Caroline
Steinberg, AHA's vice president for trends analysis. "We could see increases in
closures and more mergers, and hospitals definitely won't be investing as much
in modernizing their facilities."

The economy is also affecting employment in this setting. An analysis of data
from the Dept. of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that job growth at
hospitals may have stopped. In January 2008 this sector grew 0.2% while the
larger economy lost 0.1% of its jobs. Preliminary data from March indicate that
hospitals did not add a significant number of jobs while the broader economy
lost 0.5% of positions. The number of hospital mass layoffs also grew.

In addition, economic issues are affecting the kind of relationship physicians
seek with hospitals. The November 2008 survey revealed that 56% of hospital CEOs
were receiving more requests from physicians for increased pay for on-call or
other provided services, for a job, to sell a practice or to partner on
purchasing equipment. That number jumped to 65% in the more recent report.

This situation is believed to be a result of rising unemployment in the country
as a whole. This means larger numbers of uninsured patients are reporting for
emergency department care. In November 2008, 23% of hospital CEOs noted a
moderate or significant increase in emergency department usage. The March survey
found that 58% were saying the percentage of visits to this part of the hospital
by those without insurance had grown at least moderately.

Requests for elective procedures also declined. Approximately 31% of CEOs said
in November 2008 that their institutions were experiencing a moderate or
significant decline in these types of procedures. This number jumped to 59% in
the March survey. Demand for subsidized services grew for 37% of institutions in
the November 2008 survey. This number increased to 53% in the March one.
Charitable contributions to pay for these services went down for 37% of
institutions in November 2008 and for 39% in March of this year.

Belt tightening, asking for help

The American Hospital Assn. surveyed CEOs of community hospitals in November
2008 and March of this year. A total of 736 completed the first questionnaire on
the changes being taken or considered to maintain fiscal viability; 1,078 CEOs
responded to the second survey, which focused on action taken. Both surveys also
asked the CEOs about the numbers of physicians seeking monetary help.
Respondents came from all over the country, and represented small and large
institutions in urban and rural settings.

Stalled job growth

The growth of health-related jobs has long outpaced that of many other
industries. But the most recent numbers from the Dept. of Labor's Bureau of
Labor Statistics indicate that, while the hospital job sector is still doing
better than the economy as a whole, the number of positions appears no longer to
be increasing. Here are seasonally adjusted percentage changes in hospital
industry employment compared with that of all sectors. Numbers for February and
March are preliminary.

Passing out pink slips

The number of times hospitals laid off at least 50 people at once is growing,
according to data from the Dept. of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here is
how the number of times hospitals had mass layoffs compares with the health care
sector in general.
