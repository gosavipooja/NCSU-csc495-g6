A hospital railway station has been officially opened - two months after it
carried its first passengers.

Minister of State for Transport, Baroness Kramer today opened the new £2.2m
James Cook University Hospital station.

She named the train she arrived on - Captain James Cook, Master Mariner - and
unveiled an official plaque to mark the development of the station, which lies
behind the hospital.

Up to 17 Northern Rail trains on the Esk Valley line call at the new stop, which
was launched to boost access to the hospital as well as help tackle traffic
congestion on Marton Road.

It was funded following a Local Sustainable Transport Fund bid from the
Department for Transport by TVU, the Local Enterprise Partnership for Tees
Valley.

Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said: "I am very pleased that we have been
able to contribute £2m towards the new station at The James Cook University
Hospital, which will serve staff, patients and visitors as well as enhancing the
wider transport network. Good transport connections act as an engine for
economic growth, and link local people to vital services."

Councillor Charlie Rooney, Middlesbrough Council's executive member for
regeneration, said: "The new station is fantastic for the town, the hospital and
our communities.

"As well as helping the area realise one of its ambitions to improve rail
passenger facilities and enhance the rail network, it supports economic
regeneration by improving transport links for workers and accessibility to key
sites."
