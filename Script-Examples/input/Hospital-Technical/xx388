The Buckhead Home Depot is in search of a larger location, says Home Depot
spokesperson Jerry Shields. The Piedmont Road location suffers from its own
success: at under 80,000 square feet, it's small compared to newer facilities of
102,000 square feet.

"The size was dictated by the land," says Shields. The parking lot is cramped
and no left turns are allowed off Piedmont into the property. "It's a good
store; we'd like it to handle business better," says Shields.

No deal has been struck for a new site, he says. There's been speculation Home
Depot's looking at a site near Georgia 400.

Adult industry targeted

The Buckhead Coalition, a group of business leaders, is throwing its support
behind moves to put more controls on all forms of adult entertainment, including
lingerie modeling and escort services.

The group recently petitioned the Atlanta City Council to adopt tighter controls
on these types of businesses.

It said it is troubled by the experiences in other communities where adult
entertainment has been associated with disorderly conduct and prostitution.

"The time to promulgate tighter regulations is before the proliferation protects
proprietors under 'grandfather' clauses," said Julian LeCraw, the coalition's
chairman.

Fund-raiser under way

The Kroger Co.'s fourth annual Kroger Children's Challenge is under way. It runs
through Oct. 30 and raises money for children's hospitals in Georgia, Alabama
and South Carolina.

Each time a customer purchases products marked with Kroger Children's Challenge
signs, Kroger and its vendors donate money to the hospitals.

In the past three years, more than $ 1 million has been donated to Egleston and
Scottish Rite children's hospitals in Atlanta, as well as other children's
hospitals across Georgia and South Carolina.
