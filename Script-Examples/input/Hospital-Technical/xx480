AfDB Calls for Proper Vetting of Contractors

The African Development Bank (AfDB) wants all contractors interested in the
renovation of Mulago Hospital and the construction of two other hospitals in
Kawempe and Kiruddu to be vetted.

This will eliminate contractors who are busy, have poor records of service
delivery from the race to take up the project. The appeal was made by AfDB
country representative, Patrick Khayemba Simiyu.

"When contractors are not prequalified, there is a danger of taking on weak
contractors, who are not committed. Once someone is not committed, then the
delivery of services will be affected," Khayemba said.

He was speaking at the technical launch of the Improvement of Health services
Delivery at Mulago

Hospital and the City of Kampala project being supported by the bank, at the
Sheraton Kampala Hotel recently.

The technical launch was aimed at familiarising technical experts with the
project objectives, components and bank rules in areas of disbursement,
procurement and financial management and the level of governance required to
manage the project.

The project is aimed at increasing access to quality and affordable health care
services for the people of Kampala and the metropolitan areas.

It also aims at transforming Mulago Hospital into a centre of excellence in
health care service delivery and education and training for health sciences
students.
