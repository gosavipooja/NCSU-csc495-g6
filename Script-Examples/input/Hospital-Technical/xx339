Tony Waters was quick on the basketball court, even though he couldn't move his
legs.

The 36-year-old was one of more than 40 players who strapped themselves into
wheelchairs Thursday for an exhibition basketball game at Aiken Technical
College.

The game marked the final day of Disability Awareness Month.

The game, dubbed Rolling In Their Shoes For A Day, was designed to show Aiken
Tech students the hardships people in wheelchairs face.

"It's hard to shoot because you can't jump," said 18-year-old Jessica Bailey, a
softball player at Aiken Tech. "The chair doesn't move with your body. It made
me respect my legs more."

For Mr. Waters, the chair is his life. He was born paralyzed from the waist
down.

At 15, he wanted to play basketball and said he's been shooting hoops ever
since.

Today, Mr. Waters and six other disabled athletes play for the Walton Blazing
Bulldogs, a competitive wheelchair team sponsored by Augusta's Walton
Rehabilitation Center. The team placed second in Division 2 of the Carolina
National Wheelchair Basketball Tournament last year.

"You constantly have to be doing laps on a track, and you have to do
weight-lifting to keep up your strength (to play basketball)," Mr. Waters said.

Aiken Tech Athletic Director Bruce Caper said his able-bodied team didn't stand
a chance against the Blazing Bulldogs. The Blazing Bulldogs won the game.

"We'll leave here still trying to maneuver the wheelchairs," he said.
