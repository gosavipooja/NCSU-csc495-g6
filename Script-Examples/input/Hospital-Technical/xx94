Three major American hospital systems will use a Victoria firm to install
software to automate their operating room care processes.

Picis Technical Services Inc. will install point-of-care automation software in
more than 200 operating rooms, pre-operation and post-anesthesia areas at the
University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, the Cedars Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles and the eight hospital Harris Methodist Health System in
Dallas and Fort Worth.

Picis is a wholly owned subsidiary of Visionary Solutions Corp of Victoria.

The installation contracts total $ 700,000 US and will be completed over the
next year, says Ivan Mishchenko, Visionary Solutions Corp. president and chief
executive officer.

"This software connects a personal computer to all the devices you'll find at a
patient's bedside. The challenge here is there are literally hundreds of
manufacturers of those devices, and one has to write a device driver for each
model."

Kevin Tremper, chief of anesthesia at the University of Michigan Medical Center
said " If we don't use the information management tools the rest of the industry
uses, we will not be able to compete under managed care."

Picis specializes in installing critical-care information systems developed by
Picis SA of France. Picis SA's Chart+ software creates an automatic anesthesia
record and integrates data from medical devices and computers.
