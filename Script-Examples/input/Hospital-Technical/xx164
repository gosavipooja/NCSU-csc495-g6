A COLLEGE student died and two other teenagers were seriously injured yesterday
in a stabbing incident in a busy suburb of north London.

Two of the victims staggered into Southgate police station just after 12.45pm,
and one immediately collapsed at the front desk.

The more seriously injured of the pair, an 18-year-old male student at nearby
Southgate Technical College, was airlifted to hospital but died soon afterwards.

The other, also male and thought to be in his late teens, was last night in a
serious condition in hospital.

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said that soon afterwards a third male of around the
same age was found within the grounds of Southgate Technical College, also
suffering suspected stab wounds.

He was also thought to be in a serious condition in hospital last night.

A male was arrested near the college in connection with the stabbings and was
last night in custody at a police station.

The principal of Southgate Technical College, which only began its academic year
yesterday, confirmed the dead youth was one of his students.

A local shop worker said how she saw two young black men, both injured, taken
away from the police station in Chase Side.

One had been stabbed in the arm and walked to an ambulance but the second had to
be carried into an ambulance on a stretcher.
