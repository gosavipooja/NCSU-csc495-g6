3-MONTH CHILD HAS BRAIN BUG

A TINY child is battling the deadly brain bug meningitis - 24 hours after a
college student died from the disease in the same hospital.

The three-month-old baby was rushed to hospital in Portlaoise over the weekend
with suspected meningococcal meningitis.

The child was brought into the hospital on Saturday - a day after a 20-year -old
man lost his fight against the killer disease last Friday.

A spokesman for Portlaoise General Hospital said last night that the infant was
in a "stable condition".

But health officials last night insisted there wasn't a scare in the region over
the two cases.

A spokesman for the Midland Health Board said: "There was no social contact
between these two people. The two cases are totally unrelated."

The student at Carlow Regional Technical College died just hours after being
struck down with the disease.

Incidences of the illness have doubled in Ireland since 1994.

More than 500 cases were recorded last year, and 30 lives were claimed - most of
them young children.

Irish people are four times more likely to be hit than other Europeans.

The disease can easily fool sufferers as its early symptoms are like flu.

The most common symptoms of meningitis include severe headache, stiff neck and
dislike of bright lights.
