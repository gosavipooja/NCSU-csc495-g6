Guwahati, May 12: Disruption of power at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital
(GMCH) last night for about 12 minutes led to chaos among patients and
attendants.

However, the hospital administration today claimed power was soon restored and
none of the patients in serious condition were affected as the intensive care
units of the hospital had additional backup.

As soon as the power supply got disrupted, attendants and patients got worried
as the heat was unbearable yesterday.

The fact that disruption of power can also cause medical equipment, used in
providing support to critically ill patients, to malfunction was also a cause of
concern.

The power disruption had occurred because of a technical error in the generator
of the hospital. The power was restored after 12 minutes. At present, the
hospital has 17 generators for uninterrupted power supply.

"It is true that the power supply to the building of our hospital was disrupted
for 12 minutes. The disruption had occurred as the generators developed a
technical problem and people here had difficulty in restarting them. However,
the technical problem was sorted out and power was soon restored. Although
patients had to face problems during this short duration, no serious patient was
affected as there was additional power backup for intensive care units in the
hospital. Power disruption mainly affected the emergency department," said Babul
Kr Bezbaruah, superintendent of the GMCH.

"We have 17 generators in the hospital and they are now operating smoothly,"
said Bezbaruah.
