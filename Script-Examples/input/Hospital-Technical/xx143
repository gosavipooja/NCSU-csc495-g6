of staff

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 611

LENGTH: 239  words


Representatives of the Islamic Paramedics, Para-medical association, male nurse
association and class III employees' association Dir Lower on Thursday informed
the newly elected MPA Muzafar Syed that dialysis machine, image machine, blood
plasma machine,

Bronchoscope and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine had been lying useless
in the district head quarter hospital Timergara for years because on
non-availability of technical staff. A meeting in this regard was held at the
hospital where MS Timergara hospital Dr Tahir Bashiruddin Khilji was also
present.

The MPA was informed that the hospital had shortage of drinking water and
electricity. It was said that during power outage the hospital had no
alternative source of lighting in operation theatre as capacity of the existing
power generator was not enough.

The lawmaker was informed that valuable machinery was useless due to no
technical staff in the hospital. The representatives also pointed out that
nonprofessional people had been posted on technical posts during the previous
government.

Speaking on the occasion, Muzafar Syed said he would raise the issue in his
meeting with chief minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa next week. He asked the hospital
staff to perform their duties regularly and wear proper uniform during official
duty. He said that progress of the DHQ hospital Timergara would be evaluated on
monthly basis and official found negligent would be dealt strictly.
