Commentary: Another reason to check your medical bills

Apparently the phrase "Okay, fine, you caught me" is not in hospitals'
vocabulary.

Last December, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina implemented a new policy
concerning how it would reimburse the "technical component" of certain
outpatient radiology procedures. The "technical component" refers to things like
checking in a patient, providing a gown and doing prep work -- things that are
typically done only one time no matter how many scans are performed. Hospitals
were routinely billing BCBSNC for technical components on every scan. In other
words, they were billing multiple times for services only performed once. The
new BCBSNC policy sought to end that practice.

In response, the North Carolina Hospital Association sent a complaint letter
(Really? Not an apology letter?) to the North Carolina Department of Insurance
asking it to block the new policy. In a ruling issued Nov. 14, common sense
prevailed. Although DOI rulings make Business Court decisions read like a John
Grisham novel, the thrust of the decision was that BCBSNC could implement the
policy right away.

We have to ask ourselves, what important legal right did the hospital
association think it was standing up for? The right to bilk customers? The right
to get paid multiple times for a task only performed once?
