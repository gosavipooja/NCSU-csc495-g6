Then And Now: Same Place, A Different Time Some have fond memories but others
remember that staff at the baths did not suffer nervous swimmers gladly.

All the baths are big news just at the moment because of the restoration of the
famous spa and the delays which have taken place in its official opening.

Beau Street, apart from housing the baths, also contains the old Technical
School which was originally the United Hospital. With its north facing portico,
the main front by John Pinch the Elder bears some similarity to Wood's General
Hospital. The rather heavy looking attic storey was added in 1860.

If you have an old photograph for publication on this page, please send it with
as much written information as possible to Christopher Hansford at The Bath
Chronicle, Windsor House, Windsor Bridge, Bath BA2 3AU.

Don't worry about the modern photograph, we will take one to go with your
historic photograph.
