Aug. 07--Employees at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center have filed petitions with
the National Labor Relations Board to decertify the one union at the hospital.

Hospital officials confirmed this week that petitions were filed to decertify
the Communication Workers of America's collective bargaining unit, which
represents about 73 positions in a number of the hospital's support departments.

Spokeswoman Rochelle Kelly Wristen said those positions are in the nutrition
services, environmental services, patient scheduling, maintenance and
facilities, clinical support, technical and technical support departments.

The hospital's three-year collective bargaining agreement with the union is set
to expire this year.

The petitions to decertify the union will require a vote of the entire unit.

But there's no date yet for that election, the hospital said.

In a statement, the hospital said: "We support their right and hope that our
employees have the opportunity to vote soon. The union has filed blocking
charges which will be investigated by the NLRB. Once the charges are resolved,
we believe the employees will get an opportunity to vote."
