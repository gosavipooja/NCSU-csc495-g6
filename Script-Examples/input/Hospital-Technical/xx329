According to MPA Javed Khan Tarakai, the Liaqat Tarakai Welfare Trust has
established the hospital at a cost of Rs80 million to treat poor patients while
Rs20 million had been spent to construct a technical college for imparting
professional training to local youth.

"During my election campaign, I had made three promises with the people that
included winning status of subdivision for the area, setting up of a charity
hospital and a technical college. I have fulfilled two of my promises while
efforts are being made to achieve subdivision status for my area, Razar," said
