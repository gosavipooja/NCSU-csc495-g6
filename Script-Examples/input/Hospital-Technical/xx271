A PENSIONER is recovering in hospital after being stabbed in the back on a
Coventry street corner.

He was attacked at the junction of Gordon Street and Butts, near Coventry
Technical College, at 5.15pm yesterday.

The injured man, who is 66, has not been named.

His condition in Walsgrave Hospital today is described as stable.

Police say the pensioner was stabbed once in the back.

Paramedics called to the scene were initially so concerned about the man's
condition they alerted doctors and nurses at Walsgrave to be on standby.

Insp Kevin Kelsey said: "At one stage we were quite concerned about him, but he
is now comfortable on the ward."

A police spokesman confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping
inquiries.

He is being interviewed by officers at Chace Avenue Police Station.

Police are appealing for witnesses and have asked anyone who saw anything to
call them on 024 7653 9040.
