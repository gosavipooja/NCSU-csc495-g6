   CLASHES between knife-wielding black and Asian youths ended with the murder
of an 18-year-old student and the stabbing of two other teenagers.

The victims - all male Somali youths in their late teens - were "confronted" by
five or six black and Asian youths near Southgate tube station, north London.

The Somali youths had been walking with two other youths just before 1pm when
the incident occurred.

Two of the victims staggered into Southgate police station.

One had a stab wound to his back and collapsed at the front desk.

The youth, an 18-year-old student at nearby Southgate Technical College, was
airlifted to hospital but died soon afterwards.

The second victim sustained minor cuts to his arm. He was treated in hospital.

Soon afterwards, a third youth was found in the grounds of Southgate Technical
College, also suffering from stab wounds.

He was being treated in hospital last night. His injuries are not thought to be
life-threatening.

A youth was arrested near the technical college in connection with the stabbings
and was in custody at a north London police station.

The principal of Southgate Technical College, which only began its academic year
yesterday, confirmed the dead youth was one of his students.

Michael Blagden said: "Our first thoughts are with the family of this young man.
We extend our deepest sympathy."
