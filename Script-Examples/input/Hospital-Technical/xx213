SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 61 words


STAFF and students from the BTEC Nursery Nursing course at Coventry Technical
College did a sponsored bounce on an inflatable castle.

Student Sue Cowley, aged 24, said: "It was very tiring because the sponsored
bounce lasted all day. But we raised a lot of money."

A total of pounds 500 will go to the special care baby unit at Walsgrave
Hospital.
