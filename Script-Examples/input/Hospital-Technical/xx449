PLYMOUTH JUNIOR TECHNICAL SCHOOL THE Junior Tech was established around a small
group of students based in the old Plymouth Technical College in 1911.

Three years later, having met the necessary criteria the school was officially
constituted as the Plymouth Junior Technical School.

As such it soon outgrew the accommodation available for it in the Tech and, in
1921, the school was relocated to the former Durnford Hotel at Stonehouse.

During World War One this building had served as a hospital for army officers,
and now the former billiard room became the carpentry shop and the old kitchen,
the metalwork shop.

Intended as a temporary arrangement the school remained in Durnford Street until
1938, when, with three other local boys' schools it was moved to the former
Stoke Military Hospital (home now of Devonport High School for Boys). However
the outbreak of war once more saw the schools scatter and the Junior Tech moved
to Cobourg Street, then the somewhat inadequate former Mount Street Board
School, where, without adjacent playing fields or facilities, it stayed until
1959 when the purpose built Widey Technical School was opened at Crownhill.
