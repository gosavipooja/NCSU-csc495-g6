More time to have your say on Calderdale and Huddersfield A&E plans

LENGTH: 226  words


People have more time to have their say on controversial changes to hospital
services in Calderdale and Huddersfield after a glitch with an online survey.

The survey, which asks people's views on plans to centralise A&E care at
Calderdale Royal Hospital, can now be completed up until 5pm on Friday.

The deadline was midnight last night but has been extended after a technical
problem meant answers could not be given after 11pm yesterday.

Huddersfield will have its an A&E downgraded to an urgent care centre treating
minor ailments if the proposals go ahead.

The town's existing infirmary would be replaced with a smaller hospital designed
for planned NHS treatments.

Up to 300 beds would be added to Calderdale Royal Hospital, which would become
the main A&E for the two districts under plans by Calderdale and Greater
Huddersfield Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).

The CCGs said in a statement: "A technical issue occurred between 11pm and
midnight on Tuesday, 21st June, which meant that some people were unable to
submit their survey online during this timeframe.

"The technical issue has now been resolved, and we have extended the opportunity
for people to complete their survey on-line until 5pm on Friday, June 24.

"We apologise for the inconvenience, and encourage people to complete the survey
online."
