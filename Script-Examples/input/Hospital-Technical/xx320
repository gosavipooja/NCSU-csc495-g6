Gumble, paid off for the 56-unit complex for elderly and disabled tenants.

Two in critical condition after I-84 crash

STURBRIDGE -- Two men in a pickup truck involved in a two-vehicle accident
Monday on Interstate 84 were listed in critical condition yesterday at UMass
Memorial Medical Center, University Campus, according to a nursing supervisor.

State police yesterday released the names of the men: Seong Keat Chen, 25, and
Song Ken Chin, 31, both of New York City.

A language problem had caused a delay in reaching the next of kin of the men.

The crash closed the highway for about five hours. The men were passengers in a
Nissan pickup driven by Meng Foo Chai, 41, also of New York City. Mr. Chai was
treated at Harrington Memorial Hospital in Southbridge and released.

Samson D. Yohannes, 22, of Waltham was listed as the driver of a Ford Probe that
collided with the truck. He also was taken to UMass, according to Trooper John
Puccia, investigating officer. A hospital spokesman, however, said there was no
record of Mr. Yohannes receiving any treatment.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.
