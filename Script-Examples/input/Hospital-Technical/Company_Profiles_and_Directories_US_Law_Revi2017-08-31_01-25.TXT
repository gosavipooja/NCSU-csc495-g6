KOZHIKODE: Residential camps of National Service Scheme (NSS) Technical Cell
Kerala in the government hospitals have helped to repair the unused and damaged
healthcare equipment that were gathered dust on the corners of the hospital
buildings in the district owing to fund crunch. The camps have helped many
hospitals to carry out repair works of healthcare equipment at free of cost. In
Kozhikode district, volunteers of NSS technical cell had recreated the hospital
assets to the tune of more than Rs 3 crore so far.The annual camps were
conducted as part of the state level project Punarjani- an initiative of the
directorate of Technical Education and the NSS Technical cell which was launched
in 2013. This year, the NSS technical cell had conducted residential camps at
Kozhikode Medical College Hospital, government dental college and Government
Beach general hospital and recreated assets worth more than Rs 1 crore.The
volunteers had conducted the repair works of damaged cots, surgical equipment,
X-ray machineries, electrical and plumbing works and painting to the tune of Rs
77.21 lakh at the Beach General hospital and another Rs 97 lakh at the Kozhikode
medical college hospital.According to the district NSS Technical cell, Kozhikode
has sixteen units of NSS technical cell.

A total of 1600 NSS volunteers have been rendering free expertise in the
technical field under the Punarjani scheme.Beach Hospital superintendent Dr A
Sabu said the camp has helped to repair the damaged hospital equipment at free
of cost. `` We are also planning to hold another three day camp of NSS technical
cell volunteers during republic day period,'' he said.Meanwhile, T S
Sharathchandra Babu, district programme officer NSS Technical Cell Kerala said
under the project, the NSS has succeeded in recreating hospital assets worth
more than Rs 3 crore within three years of project launch in Kozhikode alone. ``
NSS technical cell volunteers rendered their services at 34 hospitals in the
state and helped to recreate hospital assets worth Rs 12 crore after the launch
of the project in 2013,'' he said. `` In the initial stage, hospital authorities
had always doubted the capability of the volunteers doing repair work. But,
seeing their work, the hospital authorities had extended their full cooperation
to them,'' he said.

Ailing bir hospital

LENGTH: 347  words

DATELINE: KATHMANDU


KATHMANDU, Jan. 28 -- Giving credence to the popular belief that Bir Hospital,
the country's oldest health institution, has lost its past glory, the National
Vigilance Centre (NVC), in its field report, says the hospital is unable to
provide quality service and that its condition is deteriorating.

The report claims that the hospital's technical human resource is being posted
in administrative vacancies, hampering the institution's technical work. Eight
technical experts are reportedly appointed in administrative jobs. "This
under-utilisation of manpower has seriously hampered the hospital's overall
performance," said NVC Spokesperson Arjun Khanal.

"Despite their technical expertise, Shanker Jha, Padam Raj Kaini and Dipak
Mudwari were found working respectively as personal assistant to the director,
manager at the hospital's medical store and an administrator," reads the report.

According to Khanal, the report does not mention the names of five other
persons. "The highly-skilled human resource could well be used for the
hospital's benefit," he added. "This is against the spirit of the National
Academy of Medical Sciences Act. We will forward our findings to the Commission
for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority and recommend action against those
involved in malpractices."

Denying the allegations, Hospital Director Dr. Bulanda Thapa claimed the
appointment was aimed at enhancing the hospital's performance.

"Their appointment is expected to attain perfection at the technical as well as
administrative levels," Thapa said. "Appointment of a technical official in the
medical store will obviously provide quality service there. The report has
misinterpreted our intentions."

"If the NVC wants to justify its report, it should clearly point out which part
of the medical law prohibits a hospital from utilising its technical manpower in
the administration," Thapa added. Published by HT Syndication with permission

TITLE: CASENOTE: LABOR RELATIONS: Technical employee unit excluding
nonprofessional employees upheld

AUTHOR: J.K./S.W.

TEXT:

   The United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, upheld a ruling by the
Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) allowing a union
to represent a bargaining unit consisting of defendant hospital's technical
employees.

   When a union petitioned the NLRB to represent the hospital's technical
employees, the hospital opposed the petition, arguing the unit should also
include all service and maintenance employees as well.  In evaluating the
petition, the Regional Director first applied the "community of interests" test
which focused on limiting bargaining units to employee groups which have certain
characteristics in common.  Based on this standard, the court concluded the
appropriate bargaining unit consisted exclusively of technical employees.
Although the employees voted in favor of representation by the union, the
hospital refused to bargain with the union.  The union then filed unfair labor
practice charges against defendant.

   Subsequent to the hearing on the original petition, the Tenth Circuit began
requiring a "disparity of interests" test to determine the appropriate
bargaining unit.  The disparity of interests test provides that in defining an
appropriate unit, one should start with a broad unit of employees and then
exclude employees with disparate interests.  The NLRB also adopted the disparity
of interests test, and therefore denied the hospital's motion for summary
judgment, and remanded the case to the Regional Director for reconsideration
based on the new standard.  At the second hearing, the Regional Director upheld
the appropriateness of the all-technical unit.  Defendant hospital again refused
to bargain with the union and appealed.

   On appeal, defendant hospital contended two groups of employees, the
radiologic technologists and respiratory therapists, belonged in the
professional unit as opposed to the technical unit.  Moreover, defendant wanted
all nonprofessional employees placed in one unit.  The Regional Director
determined radiologic technologists and respiratory therapists did not fit the
strict statutory definition of professionals.  Therefore, they were correctly
placed in the technical unit.

   The appellate court recognized the disparity of interests test was a more
rigorous standard than the community of interest standard.  However, it
concluded the Regional Director could reasonably find the all-technical unit
appropriate under the new standard.  The primary inquiry of the court was
whether the Regional Director properly focused on the disparity of interests
between the employee groups which would inhibit fair representation of their
interests.  The criteria in determining disparity of interests included
evaluation of wages, education and training, degree of interchange, and
commonality of supervision.

   The court gave deference to the Regional Director's decision to exclude
service and maintenance employees from technical employees due to differences
between the two groups.  The Regional Director cited statistics showing
contrasts in the average starting wages, differences in education background and
training, lack of interchange between the two groups, and the lack of common
supervision.  Accordingly, the Regional Director's decision was affirmed.

REFERENCE: St. Anthony Hospital Systems v. NLRB, 884 F.2d 518 (10th Cir. 1989).

NSS project to help hospitals wins acclaim

LENGTH: 456 words

DATELINE: KOCHI


KOCHI, Nov. 5 -- The hospital maintenance project undertaken by the National
Service Scheme(NSS) - Technical Cell to create quality care for the patients at
the government hospitals has drawn attention after it won the Indira Gandhi
National Award.

The project envisages the regular repair and maintenance of hospital furniture
by the students of the NSS Technical Cell. So far, the cell has carried out the
maintenance work of 27 government hospitals across the state.

"The instances of patients suffering in general hospitals owing to lack of basic
facilities, are increasing considerably. Hence, we thought of coming up with a
project which could benefit patients who approach the government hospitals for
treatment," said Abdul Jabbar Ahmed, programme coordinator of the cell, who has
also bagged the award for the best coordinator.

NSS Technical Cell of Kerala, comprising every engineering college in the state,
bagged their first national award for its contributions in 2012. This is the
third time that the state is receiving honours from the Central government for
the contributions of the NSS units.

The technical cell officials said that the maintenance works of hospital
furniture,including repair of cots, wheelchairs, drip stands and the like, were
taken up under the programme. The maintenance work of 152 cots, several
wheelchairs and drip stands at Muvattupuzha General Hospital was completed in a
special seven-day camp.

"It is common in various hospitals to see patients forced to lie on the floor
owing to lack of facilities. Though our efforts are a tiny drop in the ocean, we
believe that our project has indeed helped many patients indirectly," he said.

Ahmed said that the cell is planning to adopt three government hospitals in the
district. "Our activities in this regard will be monitored by the Kerala State
Youth Welfare Board," he said. The cell's new website, Portal to Enhance NSS
Technical Cell Activities and Administration (PENTA), and the waste management
project were the other features that brought in the award. "The waste management
project has also received appreciation from the government. It aims at
instilling a new attitude among the people of the state towards waste
management," he said.

Besides, the technical cell has also adopted 124 villages across the state,
where they have been instrumental in bringing about major changes like the
construction of roads, Endosulfan survey, cleaning colonies and training
unemployed youth.

MGU had bagged the award in 1993 and Kerala University in 2003. Published by HT

Health sector on ventilator: ineligible, unqualified deputed in vital sections

LENGTH: 267 words

DATELINE: Jammu


Jammu, May 15 -- Exhibiting scant regards to the patient care in the government
hospitals in Jammu, the administration has assigned technical duties to the
people who are ineligible and have no training of the concerned trade.

As per the duty roster of ECG section of Government Hospital Sarwal, the
administration deployed non technical staff in the ECG section, who had no
training in ECG. The duty roster of ECG section for the month of May 2017 vide
order no SHJ/240 dated 28-04-2-17 mentions name of the employees along with
their eligibility in maintaining the section. As per the roster, at least four
to five employees without technical knowhow have been assigned jobs to maintain
ECG section. "Three employees are under training without diploma of ECG tech,
while as two employees are from different field," said sources, adding that the
deployment of non technical staff in technical works shows the apathy of the
administration in managing health sector.

If sources are to be believed, the hospital authorities admitted that they have
assigned duties to the non technical staff, having no knowledge of ECG and
without prescribed qualification and eligibility to handle the section.

Sources maintained that the administration at the hospital has been a total
failure as they have employed incompetent and non technical staff in carrying
important tests, which may cost the patients heavily.

SECTION: RAILWAYS

LENGTH: 327 words


NEW DELHI: Keeping in mind the need for welfare and skill development of railway
staff, Railway Minister DV Sadananda Gowda in his maiden Rail budget announced
several measures such as special scheme for the meritorious wards and
air-conditioning in loco cabins.

"Increase in contribution towards staff benefit fund from Rs 500 per capita to
Rs 800 per capita is proposed," Gowda said. A special scheme for the meritorious
wards of railway persons for their outstanding performance in academics and
sports for such children was also announced.

"The Hospital Management Information system will be used to integrate all health
units, Divisional hospitals and Central Hospitals as well as our empanelled
hospitals," he said. Railways is also contemplating on setting up of a Railway
University for both technical and non-technical subjects.

Gowda said that Indian Railways will tie up with technical institutions for
introducing railway oriented subject for graduation and skill development. "In
the meantime, staff at the ground level will be sent for short duration courses
of technical and non-technical nature, involving locally available technical
institutions," he said.

"The exposure for specialized areas like high-speed, heavy haul operations, etc.
will be undertaken for all level of staff and officers at appropriate institutes
in India and abroad," he added.

Stating that extending passenger friendly services is the motto of Indian
Railways, Gowda announced a slew of measures for online booking of tickets and
availability of food on trains and stations.

Gowda said, that the scope of online booking would be extended. "We will provide
ready to eat meals, ensure quality of food," Gowda said. "To improve quality &
hygienic pre cooked meals of reputed brands will be made available."

"There will be a system of collecting feedback from IVRS on quality of food.
Severe action will be taken if food is not hygienic," Gowda said.

BATH WANTS TO TURN FORMER HOSPITAL INTO COLLEGE;
Mid Coast Hospital will provide the building, and if voters approve an education
bond issue, the state will get its first community college.

BYLINE: From staff reports

SECTION: LOCAL & STATE; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 556 words

DATELINE: BATH


A former Bath hospital will be converted into the state's first community
college, provided voters adopt an education bond issue on Nov. 6.

Officials from Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick have agreed to turn over to the
city the former Bath Memorial Hospital building on Washington Street.

The city plans to renovate the building and turn the 103,000-square-foot complex
into the Midcoast Center for Higher Education - the first community college in
Maine.

The school would be a collaboration between the state's technical college system
and the University of Maine System, offering two- and four-year technical or
academic degree programs to about 500 students. The University of Maine at Bath
and Brunswick, located on Old Bath Road in Brunswick, would move to the new
campus in Bath.

But the success of the new college depends on voters' approval of a $36.5
million bond issue. Within that education spending package is $1 million to
renovate the hospital. The Legislature has already approved a first-year
operating budget of $380,000 for the college, said state Rep. Art Mayo, R-Bath.

Mayo, who sponsored the bill to pay for the renovations, said classes could
begin as soon as next July. About 25,000 square feet of the building would be
used for education, with the remaining space rented to other tenants.

"We're talking about creating a new community college for students from Freeport
as far north as Rockland," Mayo said. "But we are on a really tight time line."

The building used by the Bath hospital, which opened in 1909, became available
to the city after Mid Coast Hospital announced a few years ago that it would
consolidate services at its Brunswick campus. Since then, the Bath facility has
offered emergency medical care to walk-ins. It will close permanently in
December when the new Mid Coast Hospital opens at Cook's Corner in Brunswick.

Mike L'Abbe, Mid Coast Hospital's spokesman, said the hospital and city have
signed a letter of intent to transfer the property to the city for a nominal
fee, provided the transfer takes place no later than Dec. 31. The city would
then become owners of the 6.5-acre property, paying for its upkeep and
maintenance.

L'Abbe said a group of physicians affiliated with Mid Coast will remain in the
former hospital as tenants for an unspecified period of time. Mid Coast Medical
Group represents about eight physicians and a nurse practitioner.

City Manager John Bubier, who supports the project, said a community college
could train students for technical jobs at local businesses such as Bath Iron
Works. In return, some of those businesses might be willing to offer their
financial support.

High school graduates who are uncertain about their career path would have more
flexibility, he said. They could start out in a technical career, then switch to
an academic degree program.

Bubier said a community college can offer a wider range of technical and
academic courses than a traditional two-year technical school or four-year
college.

"This is something I've wanted to see for a long time," he said. "It's a dream a
lot of us, who came out of the university system, have had. The economic value
of putting in a community college in Bath is undeniable."

Sonography trackers not installed in a single government hospital

BYLINE: SHILPA BHOWMICK

LENGTH: 397  words


Deadline is Sep 15; Lack of technical know how coming in the way

BHOPAL: The process of installation of Sonography trackers, which was to be
completed by September 15, is getting delayed due to lack of technical know-how.
What to speak of private sonography centres, the trackers have not been
installed in none of the government hospitals till date.



These trackers will record each sonography done at the hospitals in its database
along with the number of abortions and babies born. The tracker will store all
information about the date, time, hospital, patient details, doctors conducting
sonography, staff and even the number of attendants present.

The step has been taken primarily to reduce female foeticide. Official notice
has been issued by CMHO regarding the installation of the Trackers till
September 15 but nothing has been done yet by any of the government hospitals in
that direction. Earlier, the date for getting the installations done was August
15, which was extended to September 15 but hospital managements are still
struggling with technical issues.

Dr. Veena Sinha, CMHO, said that orders have been issued to the hospitals after
receipt of orders from the state government and the hospitals are required to
install these trackers compulsorily on their own.

Hamidia hospital and Sultania Zanana Hospital both are facing technical issues
vis-a-vis tracker installation. Dr. DK Pal, superintendent, Hamidia hospital and
Dr. Ulka Shrivastav, Dean, Gandhi Medical College informed that, since this is
an entirely new system, they are enquiring about the trackers and agencies
supplying f them. Dr. DK Pal said that due to lack of any technical assistance
from the department, installation process is getting delayed. They are looking
for government agencies that provide trackers and are also in touch with the
CMHO office for assisting in the installing the tracking systems.

Dr. Ulka Shrivastav on the other hand said that the trackers need proper
computers and staff for handling. They are working to get both trackers and
computer systems installed and are consulting other hospitals and colleges who
have got such systems installed, she said.

Dr. Anil Shukla, superintendent, JP hospital, said that they have started talks
with some agencies regarding the trackers but nothing has been finalised yet.
Very soon, a decision will be taken and installation will be done.

Val Tech to offer associate degree in nursing in Fall

BYLINE: Malynda Fulton, The Valdosta Daily Times, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 508 words


May 29--VALDOSTA  -- Southwest Georgia Technical College and Valdosta Technical
College announced the introduction of an associate degree in nursing program at
Valdosta Tech Thursday.

The nursing program offers general core classes and occupational core classes
and requires 108 credit hours to graduate.

Through the program, students will be allowed to participate in clinical
rotations at area hospitals, which include South Georgia Medical Center, Smith
Northview Hospital, Presbyterian Home, Brooks County Hospital, Tift Regional
Medical Center and Greenleaf.

The nursing program will begin Fall Quarter 2009. Valdosta Tech will admit 20
students into the first class. Valdosta Tech has been developing the nursing
program since last July.

The Georgia Board of Nursing reviewed the nursing program, which was submitted
by Southwest Georgia Technical College, and issued an approval about two weeks
ago. The nursing program is also approved by the National League of Nursing
Accrediting Commission.

Valdosta Tech Interim President Dr. F.D. Toth expressed his optimism in the
nursing program and the opportunities it will bring to local students.

"Students who will enter this program are from the six counties that we
(Valdosta Tech) serve, which includes Berrien, Brooks, Cook, Echols, Lanier, and
Lowndes counties," Toth said. "Most of the students who enter the program will
probably stay here after they graduate and benefit our local hospitals and
health care facilities. That is why it is such an advantage to have such a
nursing program at Valdosta Technical College."

SGMC Assistant Administrator for Patient Care Services Ken Kiser mentioned the
hospital's plans to maintain a positive partnership with Valdosta Tech, as it
has maintained with the Valdosta State University College of Nursing.

"At any given time, we have 30 to 50 vacant nurse positions at the hospital,"
Kiser said. "The shortage of nurses in the area not only affects the hospital,
but Hospice, home health and public health services as well. We are excited
about this program and the opportunity to offer jobs to nurses who remain in the
community after they graduate."

Informational sessions will be held on June 3 and June 10 for all interested
parties at Valdosta Tech.

The sessions will begin at 10 a.m. and end at 4 p.m.

The HESI (Health Education Systems Inc.) exam is required to be accepted into
the nursing program. This exam will be given June 17 at 10 a.m.

For more information about Valdosta Technical College's associate degree in
nursing program, please contact Southwest Georgia Technical College at (229)
227-2980 or (229) 225-5280.

Dalian Municipal Government: Collaboration with County-Level Hospitals

LENGTH: 374  words


Beijing, Aug. 27 -- No. 1 Hospital Affiliated to DLMEDU (Dalian Medical
University) renewed again its technical collaboration agreement with seven
county-level hospitals in three northern cities and Yingkou City recently. For
the last few years, No. 1 Hospital Affiliated to DLMEDU has developed a medical
pattern of "the big helps the small, the rich helps the poor, and the strong
helps the weak", treating ordinary illness, common diseases and
frequently-occurring diseases at primary hospitals, and serious illness and
difficult and severe diseases at bigger hospitals.

In 2007, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Public Health proposed a new
development idea to build technical collaboration among hospitals. No. 1
Hospital Affiliated to DLMEDU signed the agreements, one after the other, with
seven county-level hospitals: Central Hospital of Wafangdian City, Central
Hospital of Zhuanghe City, Central Hospital of Pulandian City, No. 1 People's
Hospital of Jinzhou District, Central Hospital of Yingkou Economic and
Technological Zone, the Geriatric Hospital of Dalian University, and the
People's Hospital of Ganjingzi District. In recent years, by means of technical
collaboration and counterpart aid, and in forms of regular or irregular medical
technical guidance, lectures and training classes, free therapies and
consultations, and free refresher training, No. 1 Hospital Affiliated to DLMEDU
helped its collaborating hospitals with more than 30 new technologies and
businesses, and trained about 300 academic leaders and backbones for them;
helped Central Hospital of Yingkou Economic and Technological Zone, Central
Hospital of Wafangdian City and Central Hospital of Zhuanghe City set up
interventional therapy departments; and initiated research and practice in
two-way patient referral with its collaborating hospitals. Besides these, they
started a "Remote consultation platform" at the collaborating hospitals,
enabling patients in remote areas of Dalian to enjoy experts'
tele-consultations. Meanwhile, the tele-consultation platform can also invite
domestic and international experts to give remote diagnosis in difficult cases,
helping patients in rural areas to more easily access high-level diagnosis and
treatment.

Mid-west workers place one-day picket on hospitals

SECTION: HOME NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 294 words


Technical and trades workers went on a one-day stoppage in the mid-west
yesterday over pay conditions. They were members of the Technical Engineering
and Electrical Union and crafts unions who placed pickets on hospitals
throughout the Mid-Western Health Board region, including Limerick, Clare and
north Tipperary and the health board headquarters in Catherine Street, Limerick.

All local authority offices, depots and yards were also picketed, and refuse
collections in Limerick were halted.

The stoppage affected Limerick Regional Hospital, the Regional Maternity, St
Joseph's, St Camillus's, St Ita's, Newcastle West, Ennis General and County
Hospitals and St Joseph's, Nenagh General Hospital and the hospital in Thurles.

The workers blamed a breakdown in communications for the strike. A nationwide
strike was averted on Sunday night after the intervention of the Labour
Relations Commission. But pickets were placed at Waterford Regional Hospital on
Monday and the dispute escalated to the mid-west.

A spokesman for the workers, Mr Jim McNamara, said they were not stopping any
other unions passing the pickets and were providing a backup emergency service.

Workers passed the pickets at the regional hospital building construction
development at Dooradoyle.

The chairman of the regional action committee of the craft group of unions, Mr
Philip Dee, stressed that it was not a pay claim, but an entitlement.

"We are entitled to (pounds) 25.26 per week back-dated to July 1st, 1997. This
was awarded to us under the terms of the 1979 Sligo agreement. This is a
subsistence allowance only," he said.

He added: "Our action is directed at the union leadership in Dublin who are not
pressing our claim and are not taking direction from the membership."

Contested votes negate union win

BYLINE: MATTHEW WAITE

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 266 words

DATELINE: BAYONET POINT



(ran PW, PS editions)

Seven contested ballots in the Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point union
elections have reversed what first  appeared to be a union win.

In October, the hospital's nurses and technical unit employees voted separately
to join the Teamsters. But the hospital filed unfair labor charges against the
union on the nurses' election, and the Teamsters challenged seven votes in the
technical unit election.

A hearing officer from the National Labor Relations Board ruled in December that
there was no merit to the hospital or the union's objections and that the
nurses' vote should be upheld. The officer also ruled that the challenged votes
for the technical workers should be opened and counted.

Those seven votes were opened recently, and all of them went against
unionization. The final tally was 53-51 against unionizing the technical
workers.

In October, the first tally of technical worker votes came out at 51-46 to
unionize, so the unopened votes were enough to swing the election.

The union challenged the seven votes from the Hospital Information Management
department, saying those workers were not eligible to vote. The board overruled
the union's objections in December.

The hospital's nurses voted 167-136 in favor of joining the Teamsters, and the
board certified those results after overruling the hospital's objections in
December.

In all, nearly 400 employees took part in the unionization vote.

Pharmacists' fees under microscope for budget cuts;
Pharmacies near hospitals prime targets

BYLINE: Takeshi Yonekawa and Koji Sobata, Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers

SECTION: POLITICS; Pg. 2; No. 23396

LENGTH: 762 words


A key element of the government's move to revise the scale of medical service
fees downward for fiscal 2016 is to reduce the technical fees paid to
pharmacists for filling prescriptions.

Pharmacies have been under intense criticism, with some government officials
saying pharmacies near hospitals are making too much profit.

In the envisaged revision of the standard for medical service fees, the
government intends to cut the overall payment of technical fees by about 30
billion yen. However, some observers say that most of the cut will be made to
fees paid to pharmacies.

"Drugstore chains, whose stocks are listed, have made a tidy profit," a member
of the government's Regulatory Reform Council said.

Criticism of pharmacies situated next to hospitals or nearby started at the
council, with another official saying, "I think doctors are unhappy that only
the scale of service fees to pharmacies has not been revised."

Beginning around this spring, many council members have raised questions about
high service fees for pharmacies.

The Finance Ministry, which hopes to limit social security costs, is aiming
squarely at technical fees for pharmacists in revising the scale for next fiscal
year.

Medical service fees are categorized into the medical, dental and prescription
fields, and each field consists of fees paid to doctors and hospitals, and the
fees for drugs and medical supplies.

Unlike the Finance Ministry, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has a
tendency to give consideration to the management of medical institutions, among
others.

However, health minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki said the ministry plans to reconsider
the current prescription system.

Of about 40 trillion yen in expenses for medical treatment, only 1.8 trillion
yen is for technical fees paid to pharmacists. There has been significant growth
in the technical fees for pharmacists in recent years, but it has not attracted
much attention in past revisions because the total amount of money involved was
relatively small.

In drafting the fiscal 2016 budget, however, the government plans to trim the
growth in social security expenses by about 170 billion yen.

Through the revision of the scale of medical service fees, the government aims
to reduce the fees for drugs and medical supplies by 140 billion yen, whose
prices drop in accordance with market prices. It also intends to trim technical
fees paid to doctors and hospitals by about 30 billion yen.

Disarray among organizations

Amid some government officials' criticism of technical fees, the Liberal
Democratic Party and organizations connected to pharmacists are trying to
prevent fees in other fields from falling as much as possible, in exchange for
ratifying the downward revision of technical fees for pharmacies in the vicinity
of hospitals.

An LDP lawmaker lobbying for health and welfare interests and who is
knowledgeable about pharmacist organizations said there was a danger the whole
30 billion yen could be cut from technical fees for pharmacists.

"Don't put all the responsibility for the increase in medical fees on
pharmacists," the lawmaker said.

This issue led to a clash at a sectional meeting of the Health Ministry's Social
Security Council held on Oct. 22. A Japan Medical Association member criticized
the growing dispensing fees, prompting a Japan Pharmaceutical Association member
to fire back at him.

Lobby pressure

If the main body of the scale for medical service fees is revised downward, the
management of hospitals and other medical institutions will be significantly
affected.

Lobby organizations for doctors, dental surgeons and pharmacists have often
taken concerted actions toward the government to demand upward revision of the
scale.

But if technical fees for pharmacists suffer a large cut this time, the
reduction in technical fees for doctors and dental surgeons is highly likely to
be small. Therefore, sources close to the issue said the lobby organizations may
not be in step with each other.

"It was the Finance Ministry's strategy to separate the doctors association and
the pharmacists association," a government source said.

Some organizations representing the interests of the medical industry plan to
field candidates from inside their circles as candidates endorsed by the Liberal
Democratic Party in the House of Councillors election next summer.

One source said that was why pharmacists' technical fees was targeted in this
time's revisions. "The government and ruling parties cannot create hostile
relations with all the lobby organizations for doctors, dental surgeons and
pharmacists," the source said.

Playing a healthy role

HIGHLIGHT: KEY SERVICE: Technical staff behind the scenes can work in a variety
of departments once fully trained


DOCTORS and nurses may be at the frontline of the health service but behind the
scenes a small army of technicians are working hard to ensure a smooth delivery
of service.

Decked out in their white lab coats, they provide an essential function.

Glasgow's Southern General Hospital is recruiting both technical officers and
assistant technical officers on an ongoing basis.

Fiona Walker, deputy pharmacy manager at the Southern General, said: "We have
two different grades of staff - assistant technical officers and technical
officers.

"We like to describe being an assistant technical officer as a bit like doing a
shopping list you might take to the supermarket - you have to make up all the
orders for the hospital ward."

As well as fetching essential items from the pharmacy, the list of duties for
this role can vary on a daily basis. Fiona added: "There are lots of other
duties as well, for example any potential candidate must have good computer
skills. They will also cover reception duties and handle prescriptions.

"There is also a lot of walking around and heavy lifting involved, so you have
to have a cheery disposition."

There is also a strong emphasis on training. We send all our trainee technicians
to college to earn a National Certificate in pharmaceutical science on a
dayrelease basis.

"At the same time, they study for an SVQ Level 3. The assistant technical
officers will study for a Level 2."

Once fully trained, hospital technicians can find themselves working in a
variety of departments.

Fiona said: "Once they've qualified they can either work in dispensaries or the
labs, helping prepare sterile products. We also see more and more clinical
technicians working on the hospital wards."

It may be serious work, but Fiona insists it can also be fun. "It's a great
place to work. It's a busy department and people will have to work hard when
they join us but it's good fun."

Event at Navajo Technical University teaches dog herding skills

BYLINE: By Noel Lyn Smith The Daily Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 277 words


FARMINGTON   The skills and training it takes to teach a dog to herd livestock
will be the focus of an event at Navajo Technical University.

The university's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Crownpoint is hosting a Herding
Dog Demonstration at 8:30 a.m. Friday.

Certified canine trainer Shawna Davis, of Ignacio, Colo., will talk about
various techniques and training used to teach dogs to herd livestock.

She will also talk about dog breeds and the importance of exercise and
nutrition.

Following the presentation, three of Davis' dogs will demonstrate their skills
by herding rams from the veterinary program.

Germaine Daye, director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Land Grant
Program, said this is the first time the university will host the event.

"I think it's something our local sheep producers will enjoy," Daye said.

She added that having a trained dog is valuable to livestock owners because dogs
learn to protect the herd from attacks by predators and assist in rounding up
livestock.

"People should think about having well trained dogs to handle herds," Daye said.

The idea for hosting the event derived from the sheep conference the veterinary
program hosted in May.

"A lot of people wanted to see something like this," Daye said.

BJP exposes own minister's failure in handout

LENGTH: 355 words

DATELINE: JAMMU


JAMMU, Feb. 17 -- Notwithstanding tall claims of the BJP leadership to provide
good governance to the people, not only common people but party's own people are
exposing "false claims and lies" of their ministers.

On Thursday, BJP's lawmaker Ramesh Arora issued an official handout in which
failure of the machinery at the SMGS Hospital was exposed. The handout was, in
fact, a direct attack on a senior BJP minister who is holding Health portfolio.

According to the handout issued by the BJP, Arora, who is an MLC, on Thursday
visited SMGS Hospital (Shalimar) and inspected different units along with the
hospital Superintendent.

Arora found that some arrangement was made in addition to already existing beds
for the mothers near NICO Unit where premature children are kept on ventilator
or incubator. Arora asked the Superintendent t

Train them!

We cannot compromise on medicare and there is need to educate doctors and
technical staff for using new technology and they must interact with the
technical staff and doctors of renowned hospitals like AIIMS and PGI to update
the knowledge.

make more arrangements and the old canteen hall can be suitable place for the
mothers. Arora also felt that there is shortage of technical staff, doctors,
ventilator and other medicine facilities and assured that matter will be taken
at appropriate level.

He said, "We cannot compromise on medicare," and felt that there is need for
educating doctors and technical staff for using new technology and they must
interact with the technical staff and doctors of renowned hospitals like AIIMS
and PGI to update the knowledge.

Arora said that being a social welfare state "we are all duty bound to provide
free medical assistance as far as possible because we are committed for all
around development and wanted the benefit and programs of the government should
reach to the poor."

It is not the first time Arora has exposed misdeeds in the Health Department.

LRMC NURSES APPROVE CONTRACT; MOST RNS AND TECH WORKERS WILL GET 7 PERCENT
INCREASES.

BYLINE: ROBIN WILLIAMS ADAMS The Ledger

SECTION: Metro; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 891 words


LAKELAND -- Registered nurses and technical employees at Lakeland Regional
Medical Center approved contracts Thursday that give most of them 7 percent wage
hikes.

That reflects a 2 percent wage increase for all employees and a 5 percent
increase in pay ranges.

The contracts include a provision for lump-sum longevity bonuses for employees
receiving less than a 4 percent wage increase because their salaries are above
or at the maximum in their new range. That would bring their initial increase --
raise and lump-sum bonus -- to 4 percent, according to United Food and
Commercial Workers Union Local 1625.

That was a key difference from what the hospital announced last month for
non-union employees.

"Any time you have negotiations and both sides are upset, you've probably got
the best deal possible," said Ed Chambers, president of UFCW Local 1625. "We
took less than we wanted. They gave a lot more than they wanted."

Sixty-five percent of registered nurses and 70 percent of technical employees
will get the 7 percent increase, retroactive to Oct. 22, he said.

At least one in five registered nurses are above the maximum in their pay range,
bringing the longevity bonus into effect for them, Chambers said. One in 10
technical employees are in that situation.

The contracts cover two years for technical employees and three years for
registered nurses. They were finalized in a five-hour session Wednesday.

Technical employees -- licensed practical nurses and various technicians and
technologists -- voted 6-1 in favor of their contract, the first for that group.
Nurses voted 2-1 in favor of theirs, Chambers said.

"Votes against it were the senior nurses who didn't feel it was enough,"
Chambers said. "If you weren't on top, it was a substantial raise."

Hospital officials said they're pleased to be through with negotiations and
return their full attention to providing quality care.

"We've negotiated a contract we believe to be reasonable and fair to all
employees, with recognition of our longest-term employees," the administration
said in a statement released by Public Relations Director Cindy Sternlicht.

Registered nurses will get pay-range adjustments in spring 2001 and spring 2002,
if area hospitals are higher than Lakeland Regional, with the union allowed to
see that market data. They will get minimum 2 percent wage increases each of
those years, with lump sums for those over the maximum pay, Chambers said.

Technical employees' contract has that guarantee for 2001.

Those contracts cover about 1,400 of slightly more than 3,300 employees.

Tuition reimbursement will be $ 1,500 a year for technical employees and $ 2,000
for registered nurses. The hospital will contribute $ 10,000 for each bargaining
unit to the union's education fund, which will give scholarships and continuing
education.

Nurses with 20 years or more experience get two additional vacation days in
2002, a change hospital officials said also will apply to other employees.

The 2 percent longevity bonus will extend to non-union employees at the top of
their pay range also, now that unionized employees have it, Sternlicht said.

In dollar amounts, registered nurses whose salaries are below the maximum will
receive increases ranging from 98 cents to $ 1.24 per hour, Chambers said.

Licensed practical nurses would receive between 69 cents and 90 cents more an
hour. The biggest increase for technical employees would be for radiation
therapy technologists, whose base pay increase would be between $ 1.35 and $
1.75 an hour. The smallest would be between 64 cents and 83 cents for
paramedics.

These votes come as hospital employees are disappointed and angry with last
month's announcement that the hospital wouldn't give lump-sum bonuses for
1999-2000.

These bonuses are based on the hospital meeting or exceeding its goals. Bonuses
for 1998-99 were 10.3 percent of salary.

But the hospital didn't reach its financial goals last year, leading to a letter
saying bonuses wouldn't be paid for 1999-2000.

"They promised, promised, promised, right until the letter came out, there would
be something," said George Delamarter, a nurse. "That's what everybody's mad
about."

Employees did everything from turning off lights to having co-leaders work as
staff to reduce costs, said Debra Walker, another nurse.

"I think people thought they would get something," she said.

"I feel they misled us," said nurse Cindy Courtney. "They had meetings and said
'We're cutting back so you'll be able to get your lump-sum bonuses."'

She was lukewarm about the contract, saying it didn't bring as much increase as
she had hoped.

"I'd be a lot happier if we got the bonuses this year," Courtney said, adding
that she encouraged her daughter and others to work at Lakeland Regional because
of the potential of bonuses.

Although the hospital said last month no bonuses would be paid, its board of
directors did approve changes in pay that gave some non-union employees up to 7
percent increases.

That includes the 2 percent periodic wage adjustment and a 5 percent increase in
pay-range minimums and maximums.

The hospital changes limited those at the top of the range to a 2 percent wage
adjustment. It wouldn't have given a lump-sum bonus to people making more than
the top pay in their range.

Woden line 'Technical constraints' may stand in way of residents' wishes: report
Light rail hospital doubt

BYLINE: Daniel Burdon

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 485 words


The next stage of Canberra's light rail project is unlikely to extend as far as
Canberra Hospital, despite more than half of Canberrans surveyed on the project
backing the extension.

A report on public consultations for the Stage Two light rail route to Woden
shows a range of "technical constraints" on the capital's main public hospital
could stop the train going all the way to the hospital.

While the government has not released an official costing of the Stage Two
project, Transport Minister Meegan Fitzharris has said it would be "comparable"
to the Gungahlin line, which is expected to cost around $939 million. Of the
1364 residents who responded to the ACT government's online survey on the
project, 56 per cent, or 761 people, backed option 2b, which would run through
Parkes and Barton and all the way to Canberra Hospital. The second most popular
route was option 2a, which ran through Parkes and Barton but stopped in Woden
town centre, followed by the two options going past Parliament House, instead of
through Parkes.

Given the technical issues with the extension to Canberra Hospital, the
government is likely to pursue option 2a, but a final decision is expected to be
made in September.

If the route does travel through Parkes and Barton, it could potentially add
five or six minutes to the travel time from Woden to Civic, although detailed
technical studies are under way to confirm that difference.

The report also shows that recent investigations since the four options were
announced revealed a range of technical constraints to the entire southern
expansion and "potential operational and hospital access issues".

Across the entire project, constraints found so far included heritage buildings,
sensitive landscapes, the gradient of the bridge over Lake Burley-Griffin, radii
of bends and traffic volumes that could affect the final route.

A range of other concerns were also voiced by residents groups, business owners
and property developers, including maintaining green space and concerns around
heritage and property zoning along the light rail corridor.

Residents also reported their concerns about whether the light rail would
replace existing bus services, the cost of the project and cost of light rail
tickets as well as any potential impact it could have on bus ticket prices.

Others voiced concerns about the distance from stops in Barton to Manuka for
shopping and the Manuka Oval for sporting events.

The most popular stop locations identified in the report were along Canberra
Avenue, Kings Avenue, in Barton and on Melbourne and Brisbane avenues.

While Woden Valley Community Council wanted to ensure it helped develop Woden
town centre, residents groups in Deakin and Yarralumla wanted to protect green
space along the corridor, particularly horse paddocks along Adelaide Avenue.

The Property Council and Inner South Canberra Community Council supported
rezoning land along the route.

Hospital employees paid from HDF stage protest seeking better pay-checks

LENGTH: 341 words

DATELINE: Srinagar


Srinagar, Sept. 20 -- Demanding a safe and secure future, hundreds of employees
of Kashmir-based All Technical and Non-technical Employees Union of Hospital
Development Fund (HDF) Tuesday staged a peaceful protest at Press Enclave here
to press the government to address their issues.

"Despite toiling hard and rendering best of services from last eight years,
government pays us pittance of Rs 2,000 only," lamented Mir Nissar Ahmad,
president of the All Technical and Non-technical Employees Union.

"We are not asking government to give us permanent jobs, but it (government) can
engage more than 800 employees from our union as contractual, daily-wagers or
bring us under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) so that we don't feel
insecure vis-avis our jobs," he said.

Another employee, Nissar Ahmad narrated the agony of feeding a large family on
small allowance. "We want government to seriously address our grievances as it
is becoming impossible to sustain our families on peanuts," lamented he.

Inayat Ali, another employee said that they are paid from HDF, which is
generated from X-rays, ferrying patients in hospital vehicles, entry tickets,
etc. "We hardly make our ends meet. There are many posts lying vacant in
hospitals across the Valley. Government can engage us as we have relevant
experience of running the hospital administration," Ali said.

Police later resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the protesters.

"We had assembled here to raise our demands, but police after using brute force
left two employees wounded and arrested four," alleged Ali.

"Look, we don't need lucrative jobs. What we simply demand is that government
must look into the efforts we are putting in to keep patient-care hassle-free
and hospital administration ticking," says Ali, adding that government then
should see "how much injustice is being meted out to us". Published by HT

LRMC TECHNICAL WORKERS OK UNION; THE BARGAINING AGENT WAS APPROVED 193-171 WITH
12 CHALLENGED VOTES.

BYLINE: ROBIN WILLIAMS ADAMS The Ledger

SECTION: Metro; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 720 words


LAKELAND -- Technical employees at Lakeland Regional Medical Center, a diverse
group that includes various technologists and technicians, voted 193-171 to have
the same union that represents registered nurses represent them in collective
bargaining with the hospital.

Another 12 votes were challenged, meaning 376 employees, 85.8 percent of 438
eligible, cast gold-colored paper ballots Saturday and Monday.

"Obviously, the employees wanted it," said Ed Chambers, deputy trustee of United
Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 1625.

"I'm stunned. We can't thank our members at Lakeland Regional Medical Center
enough. Registered nurses obviously went to their co-workers and said, 'Join
us."'

The hospital's response was more restrained.

"We expected it to be close," said Cindy Sternlicht, Lakeland Regional's public
relations director and official spokeswoman.

"We'll negotiate in good faith. They made their choice."

Turnout was lower this year than it was three years ago, when 730 of 773
eligible registered nurses, 94.4 percent, voted. That vote was 367 in favor of
union representation, 317 against, with 46 challenged ballots.

The technical category includes licensed practical nurses, radiologic
technologists, CT technologists, vascular technologists, catheterization lab
technologists, ultrasound technologists, nuclear medicine technologists,
radiation therapy technologists, respiratory care practitioners, registered
respiratory therapists, operating room technicians, cytology technicians,
histology technicians, medical laboratory technicians, physical therapy
assistants, paramedics, biomedical equipment technicians and biomedical
equipment control technicians.

Before the election, representatives of the union and hospital said they
expected a civilized campaign. But the campaign became contentious in late
March, with disagreement peaking days before the election.

Lakeland Regional banned Glenn Harris, the union's acting business agent for
nurses, from the hospital. They said he discussed the technical-unit campaign in
parts of the hospital where that wasn't allowed.

Harris denied the charge.

"It didn't happen," he said Monday before the vote. "I knew too many people in
the hospital, and they didn't want me there. I was a walking billboard for the
union."

Both sides had said the campaign to organize technical employees wouldn't become
a referendum on how well the union represents registered nurses.

But nurses' experiences became a disputed issue when the union and hospital
distributed material giving their reasons to support or reject the union.

Each side said the other brought nurses into the spotlight.

Lakeland Regional said all employees would be affected if the registered nurses'
contract expired in mid-November without a new one being completed and the union
called a strike.

"The no-strike clause will not apply if negotiations fail and a new agreement is
not reached," the hospital paper said.

It also warned that "those who do not honor the picket lines may be labeled
scabs and become outcasts by union supporters."

The hospital has the right to give out factual information on what could occur,
Sternlicht said.

Some registered nurses said they didn't like the implication nurses might strike
or comments in a video that they said suggest nurses would call workers who
crossed picket lines scabs.

"We will not be standing in a strike or calling people names," said Debbie
Dease, a registered nurse and union steward. "Registered nurses would not do
that. There are too many avenues open (to express opinions)."

Some nurses distributed handbills last week outside the hospital saying, among
other things, that the hospital's human resources department fights nurses when
they present grievances and push for wage increases instead of bonuses.

Hospital officials told them to stop.

"The contract says they will not distribute handbills at the entrance to the
hospital," Sternlicht said.

Harris said the contract bans distributing literature within the hospital, when
employees are working, not outside on their own time.

Despite those disagreements, both sides said the campaign for technical workers
appeared to cause less tension among employees than the effort to organize
registered nurses.

Technical and non Technical staff of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blocked the Khyber Road
for five hours in a protest against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday
and demanding up-gradation of their services like other official crew in
province.
A large number of protestors staged a demonstration at Soori Pul area on Khyber
Road. They chanted slogans against KP government while they holding placards and
banners in their hands were also full of anti-government writings. All the
personal and commuter's vehicles were stopped to travel and only pedestrians and
patients were permitted to move.


President KP of all technical and non-technical staff led the protest and
protestors kept stones at the middle of Khyber Road. He also addressed the
participants on the occasion and used harsh words against the KP led coalition
government. He said the KP government did not announce their up-gradation in the
current fiscal year of 2014, 14 and they have been deprived of their basic
rights since long.
Technical and non-technical staff of Lady Reading Hospital, Hayatabad Medical
Complex, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Mardan Complex, Abotabad Complex, University
of Peshawar, Agriculture, Engineering University of Peshawar, Islamia College
Peshawar University and other departments participated in protest.
Speakers also informed that KP government had planned to expel daily wagers,
working in various departments in Peshawar, from their services and it was not a
justice with poor employees.
One of the electricians, Dooran Shah, while talking to The Frontier Post said
that he had joined the duty prior to 16 years in six grade but still in 2014 he
performs his duty in six rank. He asked they should be up-graded like other
department's staff and saying it was their basic right. About the KP, he said it
had come into power with the manifesto of change and justice but it had also
resorted injustice and brutality.

and left the area.

'BURGLAR' RIDDLE IN DEATH OF MAN, 68

BYLINE: Vanessa Conneely

LENGTH: 239 words


A BLOOD-spattered old man has been found dead under a toppled bedroom wardrobe
sparking fears he was the victim of a bungled burglary.

Cops say the death of the unnamed pensioner - whose Cork city bungalow has been
raided several times in recent years - is suspicious.

The grim find came around midday yesterday after a Meals On Wheels volunteer got
no reply to her knock on the door.

Shaken neighbour Ann Herlihy, who found the 68-year-old's body after letting the
volunteer in, said: "We knocked, but when he didn't answer I opened the door and
went in and found him.

"He had a wardrobe on top of him and blood on the side of his arm."

Quiet

Locals in Togher have told gardai they spotted a young stranger hanging around
the area late on Monday.

Neighbour Kathleen Sheehan said: "I saw a young boy going in around the back of
the house but I didn't know who it was."

She described the dead man, who had lived alone in the bungalow for over three
years, as a quiet person who kept to himself.

His body was taken to Cork University Hospital for a post mortem examination.

A Garda source said: "We are carrying out a full investigation and are treating
the death as suspicious until we find out more details.

"The area has been sealed off and Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret
Bolster and members of the Garda Technical Bureau are at the scene to carry out
a technical examination."

VETERANS HOSPITAL BRINGS ITS SERVICES TO STUDENTS;
A GRANT WILL ALLOW THE ORGANIZATION TO OFFER BASIC CARE AT MATC.;
MADISON AREA TECHNICAL COLLEGE

BYLINE: By DEBORAH ZIFF dziff@madison.com 608-252-6234

SECTION: FRONT; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 620 words


All told, Savage Margraf spent about 5

1/2 hours Wednesday afternoon going to a series of appointments at the Veterans
Hospital.

That meant the 25-year-old Iraq War veteran missed two classes at Madison Area
Technical College to get treatment for her traumatic brain injury and other
health problems.

But a new program at MATC could make it easier for student veterans to balance
school and their health. The Madison Veterans Hospital won a grant to create a
mini-VA at the college.

The new program, to start in May, will have a full-time social worker at the
college. Specialists - including a psychiatrist, psychologist, addiction
specialist and benefits expert - will drop in once a week. Wellness programs,
such as yoga and tai chi, will be offered.

"It's stressful to try to cram doctors appointments in between classes, where
you have to leave the school, go all the way to the V.A., and come back," said
Margraf, who served in the Marine Corps for four years. "It makes it a lot more
stressful to try to do that than it would be to just walk downstairs."

High concentration of vets

The number of student veterans at MATC - also known as Madison College - is the
highest among Wisconsin's 16 technical colleges, according to data from the
Wisconsin Technical College System. There were 588 students receiving a tuition
waiver under the state and federal GI bills at MATC in the 2010-11 academic
year, the most recent year for which state data are available. Milwaukee Area
Technical College had 504 student veterans.

MATC officials said that figure doesn't reflect the full number of veterans
because there are some who don't qualify for tuition benefits. They said there
were 786 full- and part-time students in 2011-12.

"I think it's important to realize the reintegration process, coming back
especially if they were deployed to a war zone, is a monumental task," said
Heidi Sigmund, a psychologist at the Veterans Hospital and director of a program
on post-traumatic stress disorder. "Many veterans say the journey of going from
civilian to soldier or Marine is easy when you compare it to trying to come back
from Marine or soldier to civilian."

She said some veterans feel they don't fit in with other students. Others with
PTSD might have anxiety disorders that are triggered by crowded classrooms. Many
veterans are trying to juggle going to school with a family, work and therapy,
Sigmund said.

"One of the goals is to kind of just relocate a clinic (at MATC) a couple days a
week where they can really get everything they would receive here, there,"
Sigmund said. "Our effort is to decrease any barriers to care, to just make us
as accessible as possible."

Officials said they hoped the close proximity would draw in new patients. In a
survey conducted by the hospital, students said the hospital's location was
inconvenient, they didn't know what services were offered, and it was too
complicated to access benefits.

Making it easier

Margraf talks openly about her health problems in the hopes of helping other
veterans. She said there's still a negative stigma toward mental health
treatment in the military.

The Lodi resident suffers from PTSD, a back injury and a traumatic brain injury
from her time as a turret gunner in Iraq. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer
last March.

Margraf - who said her father named her after the Savage Arms rifle company - is
in the liberal arts transfer program and hopes to attend UW-Madison in the fall.

She won't be able to get treatment for all of her ailments at MATC, but she may
be able to schedule appointments to treat some things, such as PTSD.

"I'm supposed to be doing a newer PTSD treatment therapy," she said. "But I
haven't been able to schedule it because of school."

 Washington: Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:



 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Resources and Services
Administration Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission to OMB for
Review and Approval; Public Comment Request; Small Rural Hospital Transitions
Project AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Department
of Health and Human Services ACTION: Notice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY:
In compliance with Section 3507(a)(1)(D) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,
HRSA submitted an Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. Comments submitted during
the first public review of this ICR will be provided to OMB.

OMB will accept further comments from the public during the review and approval
period. DATES: Comments on this ICR should be received no later than October 11,
2016. ADDRESSES: Submit your comments, including the ICR Title, to the desk
officer for HRSA, either by email to OIRA_submission@omb.eop.gov or by fax to
202-395-5806. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To request a copy of the
clearance requests submitted to OMB for review, email the HRSA Information

Rural Hospital Transitions Project OMB No. 0906-xxxx--NEW Abstract: Under
Section 330A of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254c(e)), the Federal
Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) funds grant programs supporting expanding
access to, and improving the quality of essential health care services in rural
and frontier communities. Small rural hospitals are facing many challenges in
the new health care environment, including the concurrent need to better measure
and account for quality of care in all settings; improving transitions of care
as patients move from one care setting to another; adopting new payment
approaches such as value-based purchasing; and tailoring operations to the new
approaches to care delivery, such as accountable care organizations (ACO) and
patient-centered medical homes. Success in this new environment will require
bridging the gaps between the current system and the newly emerging system of
healthcare delivery and payment. Because little is known about how these new
models might impact rural communities, there is a need to help hospitals
understand and consider those factors that would make them logical participants
in health care systems that focus on value. The Small Rural Hospital Transitions
(SRHT) Project will assist small rural hospitals in making the transition. The
purpose of the project is to provide on-site technical assistance to nine small
rural hospitals located in persistent poverty counties. Technical assistance
will be provided in the areas of: (1) Financial assessments, (2) creating a
quality-focused environment, (3) aligning services to community need, and, (4)
to the extent that financial and quality core areas have been stabilized,
assistance to help the hospitals consider factors that would make them logical
participants in health care systems that focus on value (for example ACOs,
shared savings programs, primary care medical homes). Need and Proposed Use of
the Information: The information will be solicited in the form of the SRHT
Project Technical Assistance Online Application form and the supporting hospital
assessment, Performance Excellence for Rural Hospitals. All small rural
hospitals desiring to apply for onsite technical assistance through SRHT will be
required to complete the application and the survey. The applicant's information
will be scored and ranked to aid in the selection of nine small rural hospitals
to receive on-site technical assistance. Both the application form and the
hospital assessment are designed to ensure the selection of hospital applicants
consistent with established eligibility criteria and hospitals readiness or
ability to implement consultant's recommendations. A 60-day Federal Register
Notice was published in the Federal Register on June 24, 2016 (81 FR 41315).
There were no public comments. Likely Respondents: Small rural hospitals located
in a rural community, as defined by FORHP, persistent poverty county, or a rural
census tract of a metro persistent poverty county; have 49 staffed beds or less
as reported on the hospital's most recently filed Medicare Cost Report.
Hospitals; and for-profit or not-for-profit. Burden Statement: Burden in this
context means the time expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain,
disclose or provide the information requested. This includes the time needed to
review instructions; to develop, acquire, install and utilize technology and
systems for the purpose of collecting, validating and verifying information,
processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing
information; to train personnel and to be able to respond to a collection of
information; to search data sources; to complete and review the collection of
information; and to transmit or otherwise disclose the information. The total
annual burden hours estimated for this ICR are summarized in the table below.

Hospital programme earns seal of approval

                                January 31, 1997


BUDDY SYSTEM OF TRAINING

NEW staff at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital's specialist clinics will be taken in
hand by more senior colleagues under the "buddy" system of its in-house training
programme.

This programme received a national "seal of approval" on Wednesday when the
Institute of Technical Education certified KKH as an on-the-job training centre.

KKH is the first restructured hospital to be given this recognition.

A total of 40 staff -trained by the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board
-have been selected to coach and assess new trainees.

KKH's chief executive officer, Dr Jennifer Lee, said the training programme for
its frontline staff, for instance, was to help with their heavy workload of
dealing with pregnant patients.

"They have to deal with more than 900 patients every day," she said.

"Sometimes, patients also bring along their husbands, grandparents and even
their children!"

Nineteen new outpatient assistants being recruited for the specialist clinics
will be the first to undergo the training.

The clinics will start operating in March, when the New KK Women and Children's
Hospital opens.

At KKH, each trainee will be given a brief classroom session and then be taken
under the wing of a more experienced staff member, who will coach and assess
their performance.

Ms Joanne Tay-Yap, KKH's administrator of ambulatory services, said this would
make new staff feel they were also being looked after, apart from being trained.

She said: "When you can provide a good environment for your staff, they will
actually stay longer."

Trainees have to complete three modules -duties at counters such as
registration, clinical duties which include assisting doctors in preparing
patients for pap smears, and customer service which covers ways of handling
difficult cases.

Five KKH staff have been appointed as managers to oversee the programme, which
will also be extended to existing staff.

Ms Eileen Loh, 33, who joined KKH three months ago, was one of the specialist
outpatient assistants who completed the counter module under the programme's
trial run.

She said: "It was very good training. You learn as you go along.  If I made any
mistakes while serving patients, my trainer would tell me and I could correct it
immediately."

Dr Law Song Seng, ITE's director and CEO, said the institute introduced its
certification system in April 1994 as recognition of on-the-job training efforts
by employers and workers.

"It was also to provide a structure to improve the quality of such training in
companies," he said.

To date, more than 320 companies have been certified as on-the-job training
centres.

These are in such industries as electronics, precision engineering, marine,
tourism and retailing, logistics and health care.

Said Dr Law: "Our national target is to certify 500 companies by the year 2000."

Nursing Home Act 1949 makes it mandatory for a doctor running and managing a
hospital or nursing home to have it registered with the local civic body.

The inspection drive carried out by the PMC a few days ago had revealed that
many nursing homes in the city were being run without a licence.

"Many nursing homes could not get the mandatory registration (licence) for
technical non-compliance. The delegation requested the municipal commissioner to
relax certain rules. The commissioner assured to extend all administrative help
to expedite the registration processes and asked doctors' associations to
conduct workshops to sensitize doctors about fulfilling formalities," said
physician and corporator Siddharth Dhende who coordinated the doctors's
delegation.

President and secretaries of various doctors' associations, such as the Yerawada
Doctor's Association, National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA), Indian
Medical Association, General Practitioners' Association and Ahmednagar Road
Doctors' Association, from different parts of the city were present for the
meeting.

"Our demands are simple. Existing hospitals, which have been serving people for
years but do not fit into criteria laid down for seeking registration due to
technical and non-medical reasons, should be accommodated for technical
non-compliance," said Hitesh Solanki, medical administrator, Shah Accident
Hospital, Airport road, Yerawada.

Elaborating, Solanki said, "Technical and structural non-compliances -- such as
length of the staircase, height of the building, etc, laid down for nursing
homes -- can be excused if the nursing home has all the medical facilities
required and is manned by trained medical professionals. Certain amendments can
be made in the Development Control (DC) rules for easy compliance."

Two years ago, when swine flu pandemic was at its peak, it was clearly evident
in the initial few days that the municipal corporation and state-run hospitals
could not cater to the large population affected. The public-private partnership
model adopted by Mahesh Zagade, who was then the municipal commissioner, proved
successful in containing the pandemic, he observed .

"More than 90% of the registration are pending with the civic body due to such
technical and non-medical reasons. We do not support any illegal activity and
malpractices, but wherever possible, PMC should relax technical non-compliance.
We don't request for any compromise with respect to basic requirements of
medical practice," said gynaecologist Milind Walunjkar of Yerawada Doctors'
Association that has over 200 members. Private healthcare providers take care of
90% of city's healthcare requirements. Depriving them of registration on
technical grounds would be unfair, he said.

"Getting all documentary compliance, such as a no-objection certificate from
local governing body's civil department, etc, is very difficult. Besides, if a
nursing home is situated on the first or above floors, it should have a separate
staircase as well as an elevator, sufficient parking space, separate water
connection, etc. Fulfilling all these norms becomes extremely difficult," said a
PMC official.

Civic chief Mahesh Pathak said, "We are ready to provide all administrative
help. But there is no exemption from DC rules. Doctors' associations should
sensitize their members about the DC rules and inculcate the importance of
self-control among their members."

Sodexo Thailand projects 11% growth - Upbeat outlook on tourism, hospitals

BYLINE: KRISSANA PARNSOONTHORN

LENGTH: 460  words


Sodexo Thailand expects to see its food and facility management services grow,
with revenue of 2 billion baht projected this fiscal year from Sept 1, 2014.

That figure represents 11.1% growth from the previous fiscal year.

The positive outlook is spurred by local political stability and growing
tourism, country manager Arnaud Bialecki said.

"In general, the Thai economy has been picking up since late last year, and this
is benefiting many businesses including Sodexo," he said.

Sodexo Thailand engages in three main business activities - food supply,
technical services for buildings and facilities and non-technical services such
as maids, security and gardening.

Ever since the tourism industry started rebounding last November, the company
saw its tourism-related business improve. Its food supply for hospitals and
hotels is running well.

"The return of tourists and medical tourists helped, as Sodexo saw many private
hospitals in Bangkok report their rooms were fully occupied in January and
February," Mr Bialecki said.

He believes the Thai economy still has a long way to go to recover fully.
Pent-up demand from last year's political chaos made the economy lively in the
first quarter, but the situation is slowing a bit in the second quarter.

For this year's revenue projection, 60% will come from food supply and 20% each
from technical and non-technical services for facility management.

Sodexo Thailand plans to expand its services to the industrial sector, Mr
Bialecki said. It can provide machinery maintenance for factories and remote
site support for offshore oil and gas and mining operations.

The company wants to arrange food at more international schools and hospitals.
Its hospital clients include Bumrungrad, Samitivej, Bangkok Hospital Medical
Centre, Yanhee and Thonburi 2.

It also has a full-scale contract to provide food and facility management for
four Holiday Inn Express hotels.

Sodexo Thailand employs 2,500 staff, which could rise to 2,800 by year-end with
more contracts. Its French parent firm Sodexo, which is listed on the Paris
Bourse, is the world's largest food and facility management services provider,
employing 420,000 people in more than 80 countries.

Mr Bialecki said multinational companies with a business presence in several
countries prefer dealing with only one vendor to look after their office
buildings and facilities.

Sodexo Thailand will start look after the facilities for Procter  and  Gamble in
Thailand in July, he said, adding that this could help to convince clients in
Myanmar and Vietnam to use its service.

Sodexo Thailand is assigned to take care Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and
Laos, while the Singaporean office is responsible for the other Asean members
except Cambodia, where Sodexo has no presence.

St. Mary technical workers unionize: Non-professionals' vote still uncertain as
some ballots are contested for clarity

BYLINE: Matthew C. Durkee, Daily Press, Victorville, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 351 words


Aug. 19--APPLE VALLEY -- Technical workers at St. Mary Medical Center have voted
to join the United Steel Workers union, however the collective votes of two
units of service workers remain in question.

Technical workers voted 63-56 in favor of joining the USW.

The non-professional units voted 177-165 against joining the union with five
votes contested and 11 votes for joining the Service Employees International
Union.

Because of the contested votes, a clear majority is not yet certain, and there
may be a runoff election.

St. Mary spokesman Randy Bevilacqua said that it's now time for reconciliation.
With respect to the uncertain vote, he said, the hospital looks forward to a
quick determination.

The voting was conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, a federal agency
over the course of Thursday and Friday.

This is the second time in the last three years that St. Mary's technical and
service workers -- typically employees in laboratory, radiology and custodial
departments -- have voted on unionizing.

The first time, a substantial majority voted against unionizing.

United Steel Workers field representative Maria Somma said this time she wanted
to make sure that sentiment was sufficiently strong to warrant another effort at
unionizing.

She said that employees are disgruntled over low pay, reduced hours, rampant
favoritism and understaffing.

Hospital management has been dismissive of the claims, saying that they are
typical accusations made by labor unions.

CEO Jason Barker and spokesman Bevilacqua have said pay is competitive for
hospitals in the Inland Empire, and workloads and staffing are determined
according to the hospital's capacity to serve the community.

Bio-safety labs being set up in all teaching hospitals

SECTION: Vol. 26 No. 206

LENGTH: 683  words


On the directions of Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Bio-Safety Labs-2 (BSL-2)
are being set up in all teaching hospitals and laboratories would also be
upgraded. Tests of infectious diseases including Congo would be conducted in
these laboratories.

It was stated by the adviser to chief minister on Health Khawaja Salman Rafiq
while chairing a meeting of professors of microbiology of the medical
colleges/teaching hospitals at Civil Secretariat on Wednesday, according to a
handout. The professors briefed the meeting about the requirements for
establishing BSL-2 in their medical colleges, capacity of the existing
laboratories and technical aspects of the laboratories. Kh Salman Rafiq said a
comprehensive report of individual medical college/ teaching hospital would be
prepared keeping in view the available resources and equipment. He said this
would be analysed that how much work for setting up BSL-2 could be completed
with the available resources and how much resources are further required for
this purpose. He said he will request the CM for providing additional financial
resources for this purpose.

Special Secretary Health Dr Sajid Chohan said a separate working paper of each
teaching hospital should be prepared within a week in which financial analysis,
existing resources, orientation, human resource requirement and other technical
aspects of the project should be mentioned in the working paper. He said the
working paper would be submitted to the department, the work on the project
could be started. Kh Salman Rafiq revealed that World Health Organization would
provide technical guidance for establishing BSL-2 in hospitals.

Special Secretary Specialized Healthcare  and  Medical Education Dr Sajid
Chohan, Additional Secretary Technical Dr Salman Shahid, Chief Planning Officer
Abdul Haq Bhatti, MS Mayo Hospital Dr Amjad Shehzad, Chief Bacteriologist Punjab
(IPH) Prof Zarfishan Tahir, Consultant Dr Tahir Yaqub and professors of
microbiology of the medical colleges attended the meeting.

PEF: The private schools attached with different free education programmes of
the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) should ensure to provide best educational
amenities in their institutions. The classrooms should be neat  and  clean and
airy, along with the facility of necessary furniture for the students.
Similarly, congenial atmosphere should be arranged together with the provision
of clean drinking water and hygienic toilets. The purpose is to make learning
motivating for the students. Punjab Education Foundation Managing Director Tariq
Mahmood said this while presiding over weekly coordination meeting at his office
on Wednesday, according to a handout issued here. Deputy managing directors,
programme directors and other officers attended the meeting. The meeting
reviewed in detail the educational policies aimed to promote access to school
education in the low income families.

PEF MD said that punitive action would be taken against the partner schools
failing to abide by the policies; and added that clean environment involved the
students in their studies. He asked the programme directors to constitute
dedicated teams to regularly visit and inspect the partner schools every month.
This will help in ensuring effective monitoring of school partners, he added.
The meeting was told that PEF's continuous professional development programme
(CPDP) had conducted 328 training programmes for Teacher Development Programme
(TDP) Level-one and trained 9,500 teachers of 1,944 partner schools of different
districts.

Meanwhile, 328 training plans for Teacher Development Programme (TDP) Level-two
will be conducted from 17th of October to 2nd of December.  Later, programme
directors briefed the meeting about their respective programme performance and
future goals.

BoD: The Punjab government has nominated Prof Dr Khalid Hameed Sheikh and Dr

FIND THE MONSTER WHO LEFT ROBERT'S BODY IN A GRAVE OF GORSE

BYLINE: Niall O'Connor

SECTION: HUNT FORSCHOOLBOY'S KILLER

LENGTH: 784 words


GARDA forensic teams and State Pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy were yesterday at
the centre of intensive investigations to nail the killer of schoolboy Robert
Holohan.

Cops hope they will provide the vital clues needed for a breakthrough in the
murder probe.

Dr Cassidy arrived shortly before lunchtime at the spot on the country lane
leading to Inch Strand, Co Cork, where 11-year-old Robert's body was found in
undergrowth on Wednesday.

Two hours later after she had finished a preliminary examination of the remains,
his body was put into a five-foot wooden coffin and driven away in a hearse to
Cork University Hospital for a full post mortem.

Dr Cassidy, who accompanied the body, had come under fire after the body was
left at the scene overnight.

But a Garda source told the Irish Sun yesterday that she was waiting for the
go-ahead from forensic experts to visit the scene.

Their examination of the scene had to be called off when darkness fell on
Wednesday.

The source said: "The body was left in place for technical reasons. It is all
part of prudent crime scene management to gather the best available evidence."

Forensic cops at the site are trying to help piece together events after Robert,
from Ballyedmund, near Midleton, Co Cork, vanished 10 days ago.

At 8.30am yesterday Garda Technical Bureau experts arrived in the lane.

White-suited officers began meticulously clearing around the body using hedge
clippers to carefully remove brambles and bushes.

The body was concealed by a bush with only one limb protruding.

Gardai have discovered a length of rusted metal at the scene which was being
examined.

Unoccupied holiday homes above the beach were searched.

Sources said cops have discovered a child's Nike runner in one of the homes.

They revealed that Robert's body, which was fully clothed, had few marks on it.

Vans

Gardai have revealed that they used a mobile phone mast to pinpoint the location
of the body.

Technicians from phone company O2 provided them with help.

Cops also had information from a member of the public which helped locate the
body.

Robert's Nokia 3200 mobile phone which he used to call home before vanishing,
has still not been found.

Fifty detectives held a special case conference in Midleton's GAA hall to drawn
up a strategy to track down the killer.

They held a minute's silence in memory of Robert before getting down to work.

The officers are looking for three white high-roof vans. One has a red stripe on
the side. They also want to trace three cars. One is a silver Volvo seen on the
road leading from Inch Strand at 3.40pm on Tuesday.

Investigators believe that this may have been the day the body was dumped after
Robert was murdered elsewhere.

Detectives are believed to be making enquiries at two car parks, one of them in
Cork city.

A red van seen following the car is also being sought.

Uniformed officers set up a checkpoint in Midleton town centre yesterday and
stopped and photographed all red vans.

A senior source said it is feared more than one person may be involved in the
murder.

He added: "This is going to be a long investigation - no doubt about that.

"But everything is being thrown into the investigation - we are positive about
it now." The six-man search team who found Robert were part of a larger group of
200 volunteers, gardai, military and civil defence personnel that were searching
in the Whitegate area.

They were bussed to the gates of the Trabolgan Holiday Camp and then dispatched
to areas in the vicinity.

Call

A six-man detachment from this group were directed to search Inch - it was this
group that found the boy.

The picturesque 500-yard wide sand strand is surrounded by high cliffs with a
steep-sided ravine running into its centre.

It was in the bramble-covered gully that the body was discovered.

Just above the lower sloped granite cliffs are a number of wooden mobile homes
and unoccupied holiday homes.

Robert was last seen on January 4 at 2.30pm when he left the family home after a
lunch of soup and a sandwich.

He made a phone call at 2.36pm and was never seen alive again.

Last night child welfare expert Kieran McGrath said: "It's difficult enough for
adults to explain this to each other, because it challenges people's trust in
human nature.

"But parents should try to explain what has occurred. You may have to say that
there are people in the world who do very bad things and very bad things are
done to children.

"It's important that you encourage children not to feel that they are in any
immediate danger or that this is something that can happen at any moment."

Teens Give and Take at Hospital; Smart Summer Interns a Welcome Advantage at St.
Mary's

Marcella Bombardieri, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SOUTHERN MARYLAND EXTRA; Pg. M03

LENGTH: 453 words


When St. Mary's Hospital started an internship program for high school students
last summer, hospital officials thought they would be teaching teenagers
practical skills they could use for a career in health care or business.

Hospital officials discovered, however, that sometimes a 17-year-old can teach
adults a skill or two.

Take Mikey Stewart, 17, a senior at Leonardtown High School who also is
completing a graphic arts program at St. Mary's County Technical Center. In
school, Stewart says he spends 1 1/2 hours each day "basically playing with
state-of-the-art equipment," so he knows his way around a computer.

As a hospital intern, it is arguable whether Stewart has been doing more
learning or more teaching.

"We've been delighted with the level of talent of our interns," said Martha
Beavers, director of community relations for the hospital. "Mikey, for example,
is an excellent graphic artist, and he's actually teaching us things."

On his first day as a graphic designer in the Community Relations Department at
St. Mary's, Stewart was assigned a project "they thought would take me days, and
I did it in six hours."

Stewart often finds himself explaining to adults new techniques in Photoshop and
other computer programs.

"They can give me more responsibility, and that makes their lives easier,"
Stewart said.

The hospital's eight interns earn $ 6.04 an hour for their efforts and get a
taste of the working world.

"The program gives students a way to understand what will be necessary to
compete in the health care environment," said Mark Cautin, vice president for
human resources at the hospital.

The interns, most of whom are enrolled in programs at the Technical Center
during the school year, have made discoveries this summer that will help them
choose colleges and decide what careers to pursue.

Dana Goode, 17, a senior at Chopticon High School, spends much of her time
wheeling patients from their rooms to the lab for tests. Working with sick
elderly people has confirmed her desire to be a pediatric nurse and treat
children instead.

As an assistant in the human resources department, Renee Abell, 16, a senior at
Leonardtown High School, does a lot of typing, filing, and answering phones. She
has a whole new appreciation for what it means to be a secretary.

"I always had this idea that secretaries don't really do anything," Abell said.
"Now I see all the tax forms, the background checks, the postings. It's like,
gosh, how do you do all this?"

Students were chosen for the internship based on recommendations from their
teachers at the Technical Center. Other interns work in Plant Operations,
Nutrition Services and Education and Training.

Financings roundup

AD PathLabs raises $8.9M; VirtualScopics in $3.8M round

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report  AD PathLabs (Newport Beach, California)
reported receiving nearly $8.9 million in Series C preferred stock financing,
the first institutional investment in the 14-month old company.

Investors include Blue Chip Venture Company, Forrest Binkley & Brown Capital
Partners, Pacific Venture Group, existing angel investors and management.

AD PathLabs is a provider of infrastructure and technical services to the
anatomic pathology community. Its customers include community pathologists,
hospitals, physician offices and outpatient centers. Currently, AD PathLabs
services 30 hospital clients in Southern California, including an exclusive
relationship with one of the area's largest hospital systems, Catholic
Healthcare West.

Charles Madden, founder and CEO, said that the new round of funding allows the
company "to complete its infrastructure and bring our depth of experience and
technical support to more doctors."  Madden said that the funding will also be
used to explore operations in targeted regions beyond Southern California and to
establish complementary "Centers of Excellence" with nationally recognized
pathologists for consultation services.

AD PathLabs works to centralize pathology technical services provided by local
hospitals while continuing to use the professional services of the hospital
-based pathologists.  This model, it said, "has proven to reduce costs for the
hospital, increase available services and capabilities to the pathologists,
improve turnaround time, enhance the pathologist-referring physician
relationship and increase income for the local pathologist. "

The anatomic pathology market is a $6 billion sub-segment of the $35 billion
laboratory services market, and AD PathLab projects it to grow 7% annually.

In other financing, VirtualScopics (Pittsford, New York), a developer of medical
image analysis technology, reported raising $3.8 million in a series C round of
financing. Investors include GE Medical Systems (GEMS; Waukesha, Wisconsin) and
affiliates of Trillium Group LLC (Rochester, New York), an early-stage venture
capital firm.

VirtualScopics is developing image analysis tools used for detecting and
characterizing minute changes in physical structures over time. The firm's
image-based biomarker solutions are designed to accelerate the pharmaceutical
R&D process by rapidly measuring the efficacy and safety of drug compounds. In
addition, the technology "can be leveraged to improve treatment planning and
diagnosis for patients," it said.

It said that the series C financing will be used to expand the company, filling
critical open positions and funding key research projects in oncology,
neurology, vascular and musculoskeletal areas.

Mike Totterman, chief operating officer of VirtualScopics, said in particular,
that partnering with GEMS, "the world's leader in medical imaging, gives us a
path to deploy our technology in the clinical diagnostics field."

VirtualScopics evolved from research first carried out at the University of
Rochester Medical Center and that university's School of Engineering (Rochester,
New York).

Canterbury Health Board proposals stun staff

SECTION: NEWS; NATIONAL; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 153 words


Hospital maintenance and technical staff are stunned by Canterbury District
Health Board (CDHB) proposals to axe one in eight jobs from the service.

The board yesterday asked staff and trade unions to comment on draft proposals
for changing the way maintenance and technical services were delivered to
hospitals.

Support manager Murray Dickson said each hospital site operated independently
using a total of 95 maintenance and technical staff including electricians,
fitters, plumbers, carpenters, painters, gardeners and trades assistants,
engineers and other technical personnel.

Dickson said one proposal would see some external maintenance work in-house
while another would introduce a more centralised structure across all hospitals
leading to job cuts, mostly in management.

The National Union for Public Employees said staff were stunned by the proposals
and feared more than 12 jobs could go.

Statement on FCC Decision to Allow Unlicensed Devices in Dedicated Health Care
Spectrum

LENGTH: 304  words


Aug. 6 -- Patients receive excellent care in hospitals because of the skilled
caregivers, but there is also behind-the-scenes technology that works in concert
to deliver quality care to patients. That's why we are deeply concerned by
today's decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow
unlicensed devices to use the same health care spectrum as patient monitors.

We believe that the technical rules adopted today by the FCC, which would allow
unlicensed devices to operate in relatively close geographic proximity on the
same frequency as hospitals' Wireless Medical Telemetry System (WMTS), is not in
the best interest of patients. These unlicensed devices may cause interference
with wireless monitoring, preventing doctors and nurses from receiving vital
information. There are more than 360,000 WMTS patient monitors in hospitals
today, many of which are used for women and infants during labor and delivery
and critical heart surgery patients.

The AHA, in addition to many Members of Congress, requested a delay in FCC
action to allow hospitals more time to work cooperatively with the unlicensed
device community to create a compromise that protects patients. The FCC did not
grant this delay. The FCC did allow for an increased buffer, as advocated by
Commissioner Pai; however, the commission ignored technical considerations in
setting the distance and will require each hospital to demonstrate that larger
protection zones are necessary. Many hospitals do not have the staff expertise
and resources to comply with this technical rule.

We remain highly concerned that if the rules adopted today are left unchanged,
patient safety could be compromised. We will continue to work with Congress, the
FCC and device developers to seek a remedy that puts patients first.

New hospital not up to smelter-induced growth

BYLINE: Mia Vare, Alberni Valley Times

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 305  words


As the pre-feasibility study for the proposed aluminum smelter continues, the
technical team is asking community groups to look at how a projected population
increase of up to 7,000 will affect them.

The Alberni Valley Health Advisory Committee has been asked to relate back to
the study's technical team its capability to meet the needs of the projected
growth. While the committee is still questioning if the technical team is asking
about the readiness of the Valleyis health care infrastructure or the
committeeis readiness, the committee had little doubt that the regionis health
care is not ready for the increased population.

``The region has not set us up to deal with that kind of population increase,''
said Larry Johannessen, HAC chair.

The Central Vancouver Island Health Region has projected a three per cent
decline in population for the Alberni Valley in its 15-year plan.

The technical team is projecting a construction phase population increase of
about 2,000 construction workers over two or three years, and a permanent
operational phase population increase of 5,000-7,000 people.

``What it would do is just bring us back to former population levels,'' said
committee member Wilma Koivisto.

Even if population levels were only returned to former numbers, the new hospital
is smaller than the current site was when it was used at maximum capacity, and
the region is already short on all levels of medical staff.

The new hospital was one of the selling points for bringing the aluminum smelter
to Port Alberni, said committee member Barb Flynn.

``Is that hospital big enough to handle 5-7,000 more people?'' Johannessen
questioned. ``We don't have the capability to handle those numbers.''

The HAC will respond to the technical team, asking for clarification of whose
capabilities the team is asking about before responding.

Restaurant partnership buys land

DAYTONA BEACH -- The partnership that owns The Wreck Riverfront Bar & Grill
spent $1.6 million to assure the eatery has enough parking, buying land across
Main Street from Boot Hill Saloon owner Art Gehris.

Hospital stint for ITE trainees

                          January 31, 2001, Wednesday


JOINT-TRAINEESHIP PROGRAMME

HEALTH-CARE workers are being trained with new skills to meet rapid changes as a
result of recent advances in medical technology.

Alexandra Hospital and the Institute for Technical Education (ITE) launched a
joint traineeship programme for these workers on Monday.

The programme will begin with 33 fresh N-level graduates who have just joined
ITE.

Twelve of them will be trained in basic office skills, such as word processing,
at ITE for seven weeks, followed by one year of in-house hospital training.

The rest will begin training in basic nursing care at Alexandra Hospital,
followed by the same in-house training programme.

The trainees will be taught medical terminology, first aid and emergency
management, as well as using computers to retrieve medical records.

All trainees who complete the course will be given the option of becoming
full-time employees at the hospital.

Mrs Chew Kwee Tiang, chief operations officer at Alexandra Hospital, said: "This
means that our staff, who previously could only manage the registration counter,
can now assist our medical staff with simple medical procedures and routine
clerical tasks.

"This will allow our medical staff to focus on providing care for patients."

During the launch ceremony at the Alexandra Hospital auditorium, Dr Law Song
Seng, director and chief executive officer of ITE, said: "Although ITE has a
comprehensive pre-employment training programme and supports continuing
education and training for some 30,000 adults a year, it is unable to meet all
training needs on its own.

"As such, ITE relies on industry-based training schemes."

Police action against govt employees protested

SECTION: Vol. LXIX No. 115

LENGTH: 418  words


The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Association of Sub-Engineers in Upper Dir has condemned
the April 21 firing and shelling by the police on technical and non-technical
employees in Peshawar and threatened agitation after 10 days.

Provincial general secretary of the association Haji Mukhtar Hussain told
reporters here that violence against the people peacefully demanding rights was
a contemptible act.

He said the government should give promotion and scale upgrade to its technical
and non-technical employees.

"If the government doesnt announce scale upgrade for technical and non-technical
employees within 10 days, then they will agitate," he said.

President of irrigation department sub-engineers in Timergara division Zafar
Khan demanded the immediate withdrawal of FIR against participants of the April
21 protest and warned the departments employees would boycott duty and block
water channels in the province if the demand was not met.

PARAMEDICS PROTEST: The paramedical staffs protest for scale upgrade and against
ban on private clinics in Upper Dir entered third day on Saturday.

Nurses, X-ray and laboratory technicians and other paramedical staff boycotted
duty at the District Headquarters Hospital and tehsil headquarters hospitals,
rural health centres and dispensaries across the district.

Sub-engineers set 10-day deadline for promotion

They, however, allowed some of their colleagues to continue doing duty in
emergency wards.

The Pakistan Medical Association Upper Dir continued with its protest in front
of the administration block of the Dir DHQ Hospital.

Paramedics from different health centres participated in the protest on the
second day.

The speakers, including Sher Khan, Noor Habib and Mohammad Saeed, told
protesters that the government had promised scale upgrade and promotion to
paramedics seven months ago but the promise had yet to be fulfilled.

They also complained about raids on private clinics and declared them
unjustified.

The speakers said the health care commission asked operators of private clinics
to recruit pathologists and radiologists but the demand was unrealistic as even
the government was unable to recruit such staff in its hospitals.

They said paramedics served the people more than doctors did but they were
denied the privilege they deserved.

The speakers said paramedical staff rejected one-step promotion and demanded
scale upgrade otherwise they would extend agitation.

They also threatened protest outside the provincial assembly in Peshawar on the
matter after a week.

Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposals, Submissions, and Approvals

LENGTH: 1828  words



Washington, DC:  This Notice document was issued by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ)    Action
Notice.    Summary
This notice announces the intention of the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve
the proposed information collection project: "The AHRQ Safety Program for
Improving Surgical Care and Recovery."
This proposed information collection was previously published in the Federal
Register titled "The AHRQ Safety Program for Enhancing Surgical Care and
Recovery," on May 18, 2017 and allowed 60 days for public comment. AHRQ did not
receive any substantive comments. The purpose of this notice is to allow an
additional 30 days for public comment.   Dates
Comments on this notice must be received by August 28, 2017.   Addresses
Written comments should be submitted to: AHRQ's OMB Desk Officer by fax at (202)
395-6974 (attention: AHRQ's desk officer) or by email at
OIRA_submission@omb.eop.gov (attention: AHRQ's desk officer).     For Further
Information Contact
Doris Lefkowitz, AHRQ Reports Clearance Officer, (301) 427-1477, or by email at
doris.lefkowitz@AHRQ.hhs.gov      Supplementary Information  Proposed Project
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521, AHRQ
invites the public to comment on this proposed information collection.

The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery is a quality
improvement project that aims to provide technical assistance to hospitals to
help them implement evidence-based practices to improve outcomes and prevent
complications among patients who undergo surgery. Enhanced recovery pathways are
a constellation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative practices
that decrease complications and accelerate recovery. A number of studies and
meta-analyses have demonstrated successful results. In order to facilitate
broader adoption of these evidence-based practices among U.S. hospitals, this
AHRQ project will adapt the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP),
which has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to reducing other
patient harms, to enhanced recovery of surgical patients. The approach uses a
combination of clinical and cultural (i.e., technical and adaptive) intervention
components which include promoting leadership and frontline staff engagement,
close teamwork among surgeons, anesthesia providers, and nurses, as well as
enhancing patient communication and engagement. Interested hospitals will
voluntarily participate.
This project has the following goals:    Improve outcomes of surgical patients
by disseminating and supporting implementation of evidence-based enhanced
recovery practices within the CUSP framework.  Develop a bundle of technical and
adaptive interventions and associated tools and educational materials to support
implementation.  Provide technical assistance and training to hospitals for
implementing enhanced recovery practices.  Assess the adoption, and evaluate the
effectiveness of, the intervention among the participating hospitals.
This project is being conducted by AHRQ through its contractor Johns Hopkins
University; with subcontractors Westat, and the American College of Surgeons.
The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery is being
undertaken pursuant to AHRQ's mission to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health services, and access to such services, through the
establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion
of improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the
prevention of diseases and other health conditions. 42 U.S.C. 299.  Method of
Collection
To achieve the goals of this project the following data collections will be
implemented:
(1) Safety Culture Survey. Hospitals will assess the impact of participation in
the project on perioperative safety culture by having their staff members who
will be part of the enhanced recovery program complete a survey adapted from the
AHRQ Surveys on Patient Safety Culture (SOPS) at the beginning and end of the
program. The hospital's enhanced recovery project team will receive their survey
results and then debrief their staff on their safety culture and identify
opportunities for further improvement. The national project team will provide
technical assistance for this effort. Participating hospitals will promote
awareness of the survey among their staff, coordinate implementation of the
survey, encourage and provide staff the time to complete the survey, and
organize a local debrief of the reports of their hospital's results. The
national project team will assist this effort by providing an electronic portal
for hospital staff to anonymously complete the survey and by analyzing the data
and sending a report to the hospital. Data will also be analyzed in aggregate
across all participating hospitals to evaluate the impact of the overall quality
improvement effort on measured safety culture.
(2) Patient Experience Survey. Hospitals will also assess the impact of
participation in the project on patients' experience with care. This will be
done via administration of a patient experience survey to patients discharged
after a qualifying surgery. Patients will receive a pre-implementation
assessment of patient experience after a qualifying surgery and a
post-implementation assessment of patient experience will be administered to
patients who were treated the enhanced recovery program at participating
hospitals. The survey will be administered by the national project team.
Hospitals will provide patient contact information to the project team after
execution of a data use agreement. This information will be provided to the
national project team to send the survey to patients on behalf of the hospital.
The national project team will provide a summative report to each hospital with
the hospital's results to promote additional local quality improvement work.
Data will also be analyzed in aggregate across all participating hospitals to
evaluate the impact of the overall quality improvement effort on patient
experience of care.
(3) Readiness and Implementation Assessments: Semi-structured qualitative
interviews. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with key
stakeholders at participating hospitals (e.g., project leads, physician project
champions, etc.). These include a readiness assessment conducted after a
hospital's enrollment in the project and an implementation assessment conducted
after a period of implementation. The readiness assessment will help identify
which, if any, technical components of the enhanced surgical care and recovery
intervention already exist at the hospital, project management and resources,
clinician engagement, leadership engagement and potential barriers and
facilitators to implementation. The implementation assessment will evaluate what
elements of the enhanced recovery practices have been adopted, resources
invested, team participation, major barriers (e.g., medications, equipment,
trained personnel), and leadership participation. These assessments will help
identify training needs of hospitals and inform the national team's approach. In
addition, the results will inform the national team's understanding of local
adaptations of the intervention and the degree to which intervention fidelity
impacts changes in outcomes.
(4) Site visits. Semi-structured site visits will be conducted at a subset of
participating hospitals. Findings will help inform the national project
implementation strategy. Information from these visits will be critical in
understanding if and how team and/or leadership issues may affect implementation
of enhanced recovery practices, including how this may differ across surgical
services. Interviews will help uncover and clarify misalignments in roles,
needed time and resources, best practices, and potential enablers of and
barriers to enhanced surgical care and recovery implementation. Site visits will
be conducted at approximately 4 hospitals per year, and each will be 1 day long.
The types of hospital personnel anticipated being involved in part or all of the
site visit include senior leadership, perioperative leadership, and patient
safety and quality staff. Participating hospitals will receive a structured
debriefing and brief summary report at the end of the one-day visit.  Estimated

27 Firms Bid for UATH Construction Projects

BYLINE: Chika Otuchikere

LENGTH: 370 words


No fewer than 27 companies have bided for the completion of construction of
house officers' quarters and the completion of construction of completion of
hospital complex, walk ways and expansion joint at the University of Abuja
Teaching Hospital (UATH), Gwagwalada.

Eight other companies have also bided for the furnishing of the post basic
intensive nursing building of the hospital.

Speaking during the opening of the technical bids yesterday, the chief medical
director of the hospital, Dr Peter Alabi, stated that the event was to take a
look at the technical proposal of the different companies.

Alabi who stated that the hospital was following the guidelines laid by the
Bureau for Public Procurement, explained that after the analysis, companies who
qualify will be invited for the bid.

"We published adverts in two newspapers about six weeks ago and also publish an
addendum because the Bureau for Public Procurement was of the view that we
cannot publish the technical and financial bid on the same day. We are here to
look at the documents and after the analysis, those who qualify will be sent
text messages," he added.

According to him, nine companies also bided for the completion of the
construction of the hospital complex, walk ways and expansion joint while 18
companies bided for the completion of construction of house officers' quarters
following the disqualification of two companies for not following the guidelines
given for the submission of documents.

Speaking after the event, the companies' representatives commended the hospital
for the transparent way in which they handled the opening of the technical bids
and expressed hope that the transparency will continue till the end of the
process.

Also speaking, a representative from the Ministry of Land, Housing and Urban
Development, Patrick Oguleye, stated that the exercise was transparent adding
that the hospital did a good job in following the laid down procedure.

"The hospital did a good job. It was quite transparent and open. Everybody could
see what was going on. Areas where there might be a little bit of questioning,
they threw it open to the house for comment and everybody was okay with the
exercise. I think it was properly done," he added.

Chinese firm to help make Karachi 'e-health city'

BYLINE: Hasan Mansoor

SECTION: Vol. 71 No. 173

LENGTH: 590  words


In a bid to rank Karachi among the 'e-health cities' of the world, City Mayor
Wasim Akhtar on Wednesday said a major health sector upgrade programme was being
worked out in the Karachi Metropolitan Cor­poration to improve the hospital
management system in KMC-run hospitals and dispensaries.

'We have begun work on the management system for 13 hospitals and other
healthcare facilities run by the KMC, which will help make Karachi an e-health
city like other modern cities of the world,' said Mayor Akhtar while presiding
over a meeting in his office.

During the meeting, representatives of a Chinese company, Sinopharm
International Cor­poration, gave a detailed presentation to the mayor.

It was decided in the meeting that the delegation of the Chinese company would
go for an orientation visit to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Sobhraj Maternity
Hospital, Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases, and Spencer Eye Hospital.

These visits would help Chinese officials estimate the needs of those hospitals
by seeing the equipment and facilities being offered by them.

After that, a memorandum of understanding would be signed by the KMC and
Sinopharm.

The contents of that MoU, however, had already been discussed during the
meeting, according to which the Chinese company would help the KMC modernise its
healthcare facilities with improved delivery system, and supply CT-scan
machines, MRI, and other equipment, in addition to making operating theatres and
intensive care units well-equipped.

The Chinese officials told the meeting participants that their company was
offering similar facilities in various parts of the world, which had helped
modernise local hospital networks with efficient facilities.

Such initiatives, they said, had greatly benefited local populations.

They said that they could supply equipment of a variety of brands, which would
include after-sale services and training for local technical staff in China.

They said under e-health system, hospital information systems, regional medical
imaging centres and telemedicine and diagnostic centres would be established.

Besides, doctors would be offered clinical training while technical training
would be given to engineers and other technical staff.

Mayor Akhtar said his administration was making all-out endeavours to offer
improved and better healthcare facilities to citizens of Karachi.

'We are consulting with various international organisations and seeking
technical assistance and cooperation in various fields relating to medical
sector, which would help us in improving our health delivery system at local
level,' said the mayor.

He said the people of Karachi deserved to be offered similar healthcare
facilities as citizens of other modern cities of the world were already being
given.

He asked medical superintendents of all KMC hospitals and other officials
concerned to extend full cooperation to the Chinese company and inform them
about the real condition of the facilities so that the Chinese officials could
make appropriate assessment about needs of those hospitals and dispensaries.

Deputy Mayor Arshad Vohra, municipal commissioner, and other KMC officers
attended the meeting.

Shahid Afridi meets mayor

Former cricketer Shahid Afridi on Wednesday called on Mayor Wasim Akhtar at the
latter's office and discussed promoting sports culture in the city.

During the meeting, officials said, it was decided that the KMC would ink an
agreement with the Shahid Afridi Foundation through which the two sides would
make joint efforts to promote sports and support young sportsmen.

Collaborative curriculum: MCTEC phasing in new technical school concept

BYLINE: Greg Jordan, Bluefield Daily Telegraph, W.Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 535 words


May 24--PRINCETON -- Helping secondary students combine technical education with
their academic classes is one step toward taking the Mercer County Technical
Education Center into the technical high school concept.

As of now, MCTEC is only in Phase I of using a technical high school concept,
said interim Director Linda Cox.

"As far as having a stand alone technical high school, that's years down the
road," Cox said. "However, the students may be given the opportunity to take
some academic credits on the MCTEC campus."

Technical high schools take academic subjects and apply their lessons to
technical classes. For example, an English teacher may collaborate with an
automotive instructor. Students could write compositions about auto repairs and
develop research skills they could use when writing any type of essay.

Exploring the technical high school concept came about when innovation zone
grants were made available, Cox recalled. The state asked for innovative ideas
for this funding, and MCTEC's was one of 19 selected.

"We're in Phase I of this, and Phase I of this plan is to look at the present
program concentrations, such as health, sciences and occupations." Cox said.
"We're looking at that concentration using academic teachers to evaluate
possibilities for academic credits in the classes that are being taught by
technical instructors."

For example, English, math and science teachers have determined that students
taking some of MCTEC's health sciences classes should be able to get an anatomy
class credit. Concepts, standards and objectives in health sciences are also the
same as the concepts, standards and objectives in the anatomy class, Cox said.

Instead of having to take an unnecessary class for which they have credits
already, students can use the time other ways.

"This has allowed us to waive some seat time," Cox said. "In the past, they
would have to go through the health science classes, and then have to sit
through an anatomy class. This opens up more opportunities for the students to
gain more knowledge in other areas, possibly an internship."

The current goal is to become a technical high school in phases, Cox said. The
entire process could take "at least 10 years," she added.

For Phase II, MCTEC would like to take one program, health science technology,
and develop that as a pilot model for a technical high school, Cox said.

"When we looked at the major employers in the area, education might be number
one, but medical is number two," she said. Mercer County has two community
hospitals, a rehabilitation hospital and numerous clinics and health
professionals.

"We are really excited about this, for the opportunities for the students to
prepare for the work force or for college," she said.

99-95 YEARS AGO

The presentation of certificates won last year by pupils of the Hamilton
Technical School took place in the Town Hall last night. There was a large
attendance of pupils, parents and friends. Mr J. S. Bond, who presided,
expressed his pleasure at being present at the function, which was quite an
occasion in the history of technical education in the district. He drew
attention to the motto on the wall, "Every gentleman a worker - every worker a
gentleman." A wise government had made technical education compulsory, so that
young people might be well fitted to take their place in the world.

50 YEARS AGO

A new six-storey hospital block, with two storeys to be used to relieve the
Campbell Johnstone maternity block, is to be built at the Waikato Hospital. The
chairman, Mr E. G. Guy, announced this this morning at a meeting of the Waikato
Hospital Board. The new block would replace the proposed 180-bed general and
40-bed maternity hospital proposed earlier for Te Rapa. The board's thinking had
been reversed on investigation, Mr Guy said. Its original decision was that the
useful available land on the present site had reached saturation point.

25 YEARS AGO

The Labour Government is an unlovely bunch of incompetent hoons who have
terrorised more and caused more harm in New Zealand than the Mongrel Mob and
Black Power combined, says National Party Leader Jim Bolger. Thousands of New
Zealand families have been crushed in the last three years because the
Government has changed the rules, he says. In a speech prepared for delivery at
the party's Waikato divisional conference at the Waikato University today, Mr
Bolger said sensible decisions taken by people in good faith and on sound advice
had been turned on their head because of changes in Government policy.

'Get real' on schools

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 674  words


I AM astounded at the arrogance of the Labor Party on technical education.

This is the same party that under Kirner got rid of technical schools in
Victoria and now expects us to believe that we will have technical colleges and
facilities in all the high schools without cuts.

Get real Mr Symon, we all know from the Bracks experience that what Labor says
and what is does are two very different things.

Bureaucratic nightmareWITH the furore over hospital waiting lists and hospital
management, Tony Abbott's plan for hospitals bears closer scrutiny.

Mr Abbott has said he doesn't believe in more bureaucrats but in more local
services. But if you look at the Eastern Health Service responsible for Box
Hill, Maroondah, Angliss and Healesville hospitals and the Peter James Centre
you can see what a nonsense Mr Abbott's plan for improving Australian hospitals
is.

Currently, the Eastern Health Service is run by a board of directors, consisting
of eight directors including the chairperson, at a cost of about $250,000.

Under Mr Abbott's scheme the board would be replaced by five committees of
management consisting of 10 members, each receiving $10,000.

The result will be the eight directors replaced by 50 committee members at a
cost of $500,000 double the cost and a six-fold increase in bureaucrats.

Extrapolate this scenario Australia-wide and this means Australia's 750
hospitals will have another 7500 bureaucrats but not one extra doctor, nurse or
bed to the system.

The plan is a bureaucratic nightmare.

Michael Freeman,

Yarraduct Place, Croydon South.

'Al Gore of Deakin'MIKE Symon recently sent me a very glossy brochure about
climate change.

I was therefore surprised to drive past his campaign office late the other night
and see all the lights were on.

So is Mr Symon now the Al Gore of Deakin? Leaving the lights on while nobody's
home?

ACTU supports GreensTHE ACTU has confirmed that the Greens have the best policy
for working Australians in this coming election.

As a supporter of the local Your Rights at Work campaign, I welcome this move.

In announcing this week that it would not advocate a vote for Labor in the
Senate on November 24, the ACTU has acknowledged the strength of the Greens'
support for repeal of the socially destroying WorkChoices legislation.

The Greens will abolish AWAs, guarantee the right to collectively bargain,
restore the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission, protect
workers' rights, restore the award system and establish a strong, expanded
safety net of minimum conditions.

Everyone will have access to unfair dismissal laws.

I can assure all working people in Deakin that Greens' Senate candidate, Dr
Richard di Natale, will carry our policies into the Senate with passion and
commitment if the ACTU's advice to choose a party in the Senate that would
abolish WorkChoices is followed.

Bill Pemberton,

Greens candidate for Deakin,

Main St, Blackburn.

Cut subsidy to fossil fuelTHE Howard Government wants us to think that cutting
carbon emissions and moving to clean energy will cost us all a fortune.

But the cost of shifting to a renewable energy-based economy would hardly be
noticed by most households if the government stopped propping up the fossil fuel
industry and provided renewables with some certainty by setting mandatory
renewable energy targets.

There are economic opportunities to move to a new, renewable energy-based
society, as is being done in so many other parts of the world.

The Institute for Sustainable Futures report, Energy and Transport Subsidies in
Australia, 2007, says: ''Governments in Australia provide substantial financial
support for the production and use of fossil fuels . . . these subsidies keep
the cost of fossil fuel energy artificially low and make it harder for renewable
energy to compete. In an era when climate change response has become urgent,
continuing to subsidise fossil fuel production and consumption is
unacceptable.''

Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposals, Submissions, and Approvals

LENGTH: 1784  words

DATELINE: New York



Washington, DC:  This Notice document was issued by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ)    Action
Notice.    Summary
This notice announces the intention of the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve
the proposed information collection project: "The AHRQ Safety Program for
Enhancing Surgical Care and Recovery."   Dates
Comments on this notice must be received by July 17, 2017.   Addresses
Written comments should be submitted to: Doris Lefkowitz, Reports Clearance
Officer, AHRQ, by email at doris.lefkowitz@AHRQ.hhs.gov
Copies of the proposed collection plans, data collection instruments, and
specific details on the estimated burden can be obtained from the AHRQ Reports
Clearance Officer.     For Further Information Contact
Doris Lefkowitz, AHRQ Reports Clearance Officer, (301) 427-1477, or by email at
doris.lefkowitz@AHRQ.hhs.gov      Supplementary Information  Proposed Project
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521, AHRQ
invites the public to comment on this proposed information collection.

The AHRQ Safety Program for Enhancing Surgical Care and Recovery is a quality
improvement project that aims to provide technical assistance to hospitals to
help them implement evidence-based practices to improve outcomes and prevent
complications among patients who undergo surgery. Enhanced recovery pathways are
a constellation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative practices
that decrease complications and accelerate recovery. A number of studies and
meta-analyses have demonstrated successful results. In order to facilitate
broader adoption of these evidence-based practices among U.S. hospitals, this
AHRQ project will adapt the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP),
which has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to reducing other
patient harms, to enhanced recovery after surgery. The approach uses a
combination of clinical and cultural (i.e., technical and adaptive) intervention
components, which include promoting leadership and frontline staff engagement,
close teamwork among surgeons, anesthesia providers, and nurses, as well as
enhancing patient communication and engagement. Interested hospitals will
voluntarily participate.
This project has the following goals:    Improve outcomes of surgical patients
by disseminating and supporting implementation of evidence-based enhanced
recovery practices within the CUSP framework  Develop a bundle of technical and
adaptive interventions and associated tools and educational materials to support
implementation  Provide technical assistance and training to hospitals for
implementing enhanced recovery practices  Assess the adoption, and evaluate the
effectiveness of, the intervention among the participating hospitals
This project is being conducted by AHRQ through its contractor Johns Hopkins
University; with subcontractors Westat, and the American College of Surgeons.
The AHRQ Safety Program for Enhancing Surgical Care and Recovery is being
undertaken pursuant to AHRQ's mission to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health services, and access to such services, through the
establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion
of improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the
prevention of diseases and other health conditions. 42 U.S.C. 299.  Method of
Collection
To achieve the goals of this project the following data collections will be
implemented: (1) Safety Culture Survey. Hospitals will assess the impact of
participation in the project on perioperative safety culture by having their
staff members who will be part of the enhanced recovery program complete a
survey from the AHRQ Surveys on Patient Safety Culture (SOPS) at the beginning
and end of the program. The hospital's enhanced recovery project team will
receive their survey results and then debrief their staff on their safety
culture and identify opportunities for further improvement. The national project
team will provide technical assistance for this effort. Participating hospitals
will promote awareness of the survey among their staff, coordinate
implementation of the survey, encourage and provide staff the time to complete
the survey, and organize a local debrief of the reports of their hospital's
results. The national project team will assist this effort by providing an
electronic portal for hospital staff to anonymously complete the survey and by
analyzing the data and sending a report to the hospital. Data will also be
analyzed in aggregate across all participating hospitals to evaluate the impact
of the overall quality improvement effort on measured safety culture.
(2) Patient Experience Survey--Hospitals will also assess the impact of
participation in the project on patients' experience with care. This will be
done via administration of a patient experience survey to patients discharged
after a qualifying surgery. Patients will receive a pre-implementation
assessment of patient experience after a qualifying surgery and a
post-implementation assessment of patient experience will be administered to
patients were treated in the enhanced recovery program at participating
hospitals. The survey will be administered by the national project team.
Hospitals will provide patient contact information to the project team after
execution of a data use agreement. This information will be provided to the
national project team to send the survey to patients on behalf of the hospital.
The national project team will provide a summative report to each hospital with
the hospital's results to promote additional local quality improvement work.
Data will also be analyzed in aggregate across all participating hospitals to
evaluate the impact of the overall quality improvement effort on patient
experience of care.
(3) Readiness and Implementation Assessments: Semi-structured qualitative
interviews. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with key
stakeholders at participating hospitals (e.g., project leads, physician project
champions, etc.). These include a readiness assessment conducted after a
hospital's enrollment in the project and an implementation assessment conducted
after a period of implementation. The readiness assessment will help identify
which, if any, technical components of the enhanced recovery after surgery
intervention already exist at the hospital, project management and resources,
clinician engagement, leadership engagement and potential barriers and
facilitators to implementation. The implementation assessment will evaluate what
elements of the enhanced recovery practices have been adopted, resources
invested, team participation, major barriers (e.g., medications, equipment,
trained personnel), and leadership participation. These assessments will help
identify training needs of hospitals and inform the national team's approach. In
addition, the results will inform the national team's understanding of local
adaptations of the intervention and the degree to which intervention impacts
changes in outcomes.
(4) Site visits--Semi-structured site visits will be conducted at a subset of
participating hospitals. Findings will help inform the national project
implementation strategy. Information from these visits will be critical in
understanding if and how team and/or leadership issues may affect implementation
of enhanced recovery after surgery practices, including how this may differ
across surgical services. Interviews will help uncover and clarify misalignments
in roles, needed time and resources, best practices, and potential enablers of
and barriers to enhanced recovery after surgery implementation. Site visits will
be conducted at approximately 4 hospitals per year, and each will be 1-day long.
The types of hospital personnel anticipated to be involved in part or all of the
site visit include senior leadership, perioperative leadership, and patient
safety and quality staff. Participating hospitals will receive a structured
debriefing and brief summary report at the end of the one-day visit.  Estimated

Sealing of Guru Ram Rai tech institute postponed

LENGTH: 254  words

DATELINE: Dehradun


Dehradun, Jan. 13 -- The Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority has postponed
the sealing of the Guru Ram Rai Technical Institute and given the institute
management time for presenting relevant documents.

On January 17, the authority will hear the reply of the Mahant Indresh Hospital
to the show-cause notice it has been served. Both these institutions may face
official action as the buildings of the hospital and technical institute were
constructed without the building maps being approved by the authority.

Cases were registered against Guru Ram Rai Technical Institute and Mahant
Indresh Hospital in the previous year during the tenure of RK Sudhanshu, the
previous vice-chairman of MDDA. The incumbent vice-chairman, BVRC Purushottam,
ordered officials to seal the technical institute and served a show-cause notice
to the hospital.

Purushottam informed that the institute management has sought time to present
relevant documents and further action will be finalised after a couple of days
after these documents are studied.

The hospital will submit its case which will be heard by the authority on
January 17. Both these buildings are said to have been constructed without the
building maps being approved by the authority. This not only blatantly flouted
building by-laws but also resulted in MDDA incurring substantial losses.

Appointments cancelled at Royal Preston Hospital after technical malfunction

LENGTH: 355  words


PATIENTS with appointments at Royal Preston Hospital saw them cancelled today
after a technical glitch with the computer system.

Hospital chiefs say that the issue could be fixed anytime in the next two to 24
hours so appointments booked for tomorrow may also be postponed.

The problems mean that the network has lost the ability to link all its systems
together.

It has prompted fears among some that the hospital was under a cyberattack.

But a spokesman for Lancashire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was quick to put a
halt to the rumour saying that this was not the case and the technical problems
pose no risk to patient safety.

The spokesman confirmed that life-saving equipment in the hospital is not
affected.

In an official statement the Trust said: "This afternoon some of our IT systems
have been affected by a technical component which has malfunctioned.

"We have put in place our tried and tested contingency plans to minimise
disruption to ensure we can maintain services and continue to provide safe care
and treatment for our patients.

"These plans are working well and there's no risk to patient safety.

"We have postponed some outpatient clinics today and sincerely apologise to
everyone whose appointment has been affected.

"We will be in touch to reschedule these appointments as soon as possible.

"A team of IT experts are currently working on the issue and we expect the
system to be up and running within the next 24 hours."

The network began to malfunction at 3.30pm this afternoon.

Bosses at the Trust said they had no idea at this stage how many patient's
appointments have been cancelled'.

It is not the first time IT problems have caused the NHS to cancel appointments.
Only last month, hospitals across Lincolnshire were forced to shut down major
operations after a malware attack.

Hospitals in Scunthorpe and Grimsby found their IT networks had been infected at
the end of October and the Lincolnshire and Goole Trust called a major emergency
while the virus was dealt with.

And in September Leeds hospitals confirmed a crash in their pathology computer
systems led to non-urgent appointments being postponed.

"We have put in place our tried and tested contingency plans to minimise
disruption to ensure we can maintain services and continue to provide safe care
and treatment for our patients.

"These plans are working well and there's no risk to patient safety.

"We have postponed some outpatient clinics today and sincerely apologise to
everyone whose appointment has been affected.

"We will be in touch to reschedule these appointments as soon as possible.

"A team of IT experts are currently working on the issue and we expect the
system to be up and running within the next 24 hours."

The network began to malfunction at 3.30pm this afternoon.

Bosses at the Trust said they had no idea at this stage how many patient's
appointments have been cancelled'.

It is not the first time IT problems have caused the NHS to cancel appointments.
Only last month, hospitals across Lincolnshire were forced to shut down major
operations after a malware attack.

Hospitals in Scunthorpe and Grimsby found their IT networks had been infected at
the end of October and the Lincolnshire and Goole Trust called a major emergency
while the virus was dealt with.

And in September Leeds hospitals confirmed a crash in their pathology computer
systems led to non-urgent appointments being postponed.

Program shepherds students into medical careers

BYLINE: Gloria A. Hoffner INQUIRER SUBURBAN STAFF

LENGTH: 685 words

DATELINE: RIDLEY PARK


Watching a surgeon slice through a patient's skin confirmed Natalia Orloff's
plans for the future.

Considering a career in health or education, Orloff is one of 14 high school
seniors enrolled in the new Delaware County Technical School Pre-Medical Careers
Program. Orloff is rotating through nine departments at Taylor Hospital during
the 2003-04 school year.

Hospital staffers "dressed me in scrubs and put me as close to the operation as
possible. It was the coolest thing," said Orloff, 17, of Springfield High
School.

"I went home and told my mom, 'I think I want to be a surgeon.' "

The program, a partnership between the technical school and the Crozer-Keystone
Health System, of which Taylor is a member, is designed for senior honor
students interested in professional medical careers, said Denise Kossuth,
registered nurse and course instructor.

The students attend two hours of classes at the hospital each morning from 7 to
9, then are bused to their regular classes at Springfield, Ridley and Academy
Park High Schools.

For the program, the students were required to go through an application and
interview process, and provide letters of recommendation from their science
teachers and guidance counselors. And they must have completed honors-level
biology and chemistry courses.

The program's tuition - about $5,000 per student per school year - is paid by
the Ridley, Springfield and Southeast Delco School Districts, said Michael
Erwin, technical school director.

"The Delaware County economy is heavily immersed in the health-care industry. It
is about 35 percent of the employment market," Erwin said.

"We are looking at this program as a way for our talented students to stay in
Delaware County and find a quality career in the health field."

According to the November 2001 Monthly Labor Review - which appeared in the 2003
HealthLine Systems Inc., an online publication - health-care practitioners and
technical occupations are expected to account for 1.6 million new jobs
nationally between 2000 and 2010. The 2001 report of the Nursing Institute at
the University of Illinois College of Nursing found that the ratio of potential
caregivers to the people most likely to need care will decrease by 40 percent
between 2010 and 2030.

Delaware County's program is one of many throughout the state started within the
last 10 years, Erwin said. In Montgomery County, a similar program has been
offered for the last six years by the North Montgomery Technical Career Center
at the Central Montgomery Medical Center, said Kathleen Mack, registered nurse
and instructor.

"We wanted a program in a hospital setting to give students a personal
experience to help them with their college decisions," Mack said.

"Our students rotate through 15 departments at the hospital. . . . Some students
learn they are not comfortable touching sick people, or dealing with death and
dying; others that they enjoy lab work or radiology. That is a real advantage of
the program."

Collette Brown, director of human resources for Taylor, said students are
supervised at all times by a licensed staff member and were trained in hospital
privacy and safety rules before classes started.

"The hardest thing for a teen of 18 is deciding what they want to do with the
rest of their lives. The more we can give them information, the more they will
make the right choice for their lives," Brown said.

Erwin said he is looking to expand the number of hospitals and schools enrolled
in the program for the 2004-05 school year.

Orloff completed a rotation at Taylor's physical rehabilitation department and
became a volunteer.

"I loved physical therapy, helping people get back to what they want to do,"
Orloff said.

"Now I'm in the emergency department and everyone tells me, 'You will love
working in the ER.' "

Hospitals buy Island software

BYLINE: JENNY LEE, SUN BUSINESS REPORTER; VANCOUVER SUN

SECTION: NETWORKS; Pg. D14

LENGTH: 238 words


Three major American hospital systems will use a Victoria firm to install
software to automate their operating room care processes.

Picis Technical Services Inc. will install point-of-care automation software in
more than 200 operating rooms, pre-operation and post-anesthesia areas at the
University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, the Cedars Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles and the eight hospital Harris Methodist Health System in
Dallas and Fort Worth.

Picis is a wholly owned subsidiary of Visionary Solutions Corp of Victoria.

The installation contracts total $ 700,000 US and will be completed over the
next year, says Ivan Mishchenko, Visionary Solutions Corp. president and chief
executive officer.

"This software connects a personal computer to all the devices you'll find at a
patient's bedside. The challenge here is there are literally hundreds of
manufacturers of those devices, and one has to write a device driver for each
model."

Kevin Tremper, chief of anesthesia at the University of Michigan Medical Center
said " If we don't use the information management tools the rest of the industry
uses, we will not be able to compete under managed care."

Picis specializes in installing critical-care information systems developed by
Picis SA of France. Picis SA's Chart+ software creates an automatic anesthesia
record and integrates data from medical devices and computers.

UNION ACCUSES HOSPITALS OF RETALIATION AGAINST STRIKERS

The National Labor Relations Board has filed a complaint against Valley and
Deaconess hospitals in Spokane regarding stalemated contract negotiations that
grew so contentious last year that unionized employees conducted a one-day
strike.

The complaint accuses the hospitals, owned by Tennessee-based Community Health
Systems Inc., of retaliating against workers that participated in the December
strike and refusing to bargain in good faith, said Julie Popper, a spokeswoman
with the SEIU Healthcare 1199NW.

Hundreds of registered nurses and technical workers at Valley Hospital went on
strike along with many unionized technical workers at Deaconess Hospital.

The union complained of staffing shortages and patient care at the hospitals.

Management said staffing met company norms and negotiations were conducted in
good faith and centered on salary and benefits.

The NLRB took up the union's concerns, which included replacing the striking
workers with temporary workers that stayed longer than the one-day strike, and
filed the complaint.

The matter is scheduled to be heard in September.

SCHOOLS OFFICIAL FINED FOR USING DISTRICT RESOURCES IN CAMPAIGN

A top official from the Spokane Public Schools was fined $500 Thursday for
improperly using district resources to support ballot measures in 2009 and 2012.

Mark Anderson, associate superintendent for School Support Services, agreed to a
settlement with the state Public Disclosure Commission of a complaint filed by
Laurie Rogers, a frequent critic of the district and self-described education
advocate. Commission investigators found repeated instances in which Anderson
used district email, computers or other resources to urge staff to attend
campaign meetings. He also used district resources for a conference explaining
how to pass levies.

Anderson agreed he had violated a statute that prohibits public employees from
using government resources for political activity. The PDC board agreed to the
staff recommendation of a $1,000 fine, with half of it suspended on the
condition that he have no further violations in the next four years.

SPOKANE MAN, 23, ACCUSED OF STABBING VICTIM 16 TIMES

A Spokane man allegedly stabbed his roommate 16 times Wednesday as the victim
lay on his bed with a laptop computer on his stomach in an apartment in the 1300
block of West Boone Avenue.

Richie L. Attwood, 23, was ordered held on $500,000 bond during a brief court
appearance Thursday. He is being charged with attempted murder and armed
robbery.

According to court documents, a witness told police that he saw Attwood enter
the victim's bedroom and stab the victim without provocation. The 52-year-old
victim apparently was pleading with Attwood to stop.

Attwood stopped long enough to demand the victim's wallet and cellphone, then
resumed stabbing the man in his head, neck and chest, documents say.

Multiple witnesses told police that they saw Attwood covered in blood before he
apparently went to another apartment in the building to shower, documents say.

The victim suffered life-threatening injuries. He was hospitalized in stable
condition Thursday, police said.

MAN CHARGED WITH THREATENING TO KILL CCS SCHOOL OFFICIALS

An 82-year-old man was arrested on a felony harassment charge Wednesday after he
allegedly sent letters containing graphic threats to the Community Colleges of
Spokane chancellor and director of security.

William Leong Jr. was ordered held on $15,000 bond during a short court
appearance Thursday. He is being charged with harassment-threats to kill.

The letters began after Leong, who taught tai chi part time for CCS, was accused
of stalking and sexually harassing a female yoga instructor. He was confronted
by Security Director Kenneth DeMello and voluntarily resigned, according to
court documents.

Leong reportedly told police he felt DeMello treated him unfairly so he started
writing the letters, which contained graphic descriptions of violence. In one
letter, he said he would kill DeMello if DeMello didn't kill him first.

Spokane County Superior Court Judge Harold Clarke said he was disturbed about
Leong's escalation after he was banned from the SCC campus.

Following the recent Looking Back pieces on Widey Tech, Len Williams was
prompted to get in touch.

Said Len: "I would like to add some further information on its forerunner,
Plymouth Junior Technical School, which I attended in 1947 and 1948.

"The school at this time was sited in the old Mount Street Board School, but its
past history reveals that some 5,000 boys passed through the school over the
years.

"The school evolved from a small group of students based in the old Plymouth
Technical College in 1911. By 1914 the group had met the necessary criteria and
were officially recognised by the local education authority and named the
Plymouth Junior Technical School.

"In 1921 the accommodation situation at the college had become a problem, and
this was temporarily solved by sending the young school to the former Durnford
Hotel, and World War One hospital for Army officers, in Stonehouse.

"The billiard room became the carpenter's shop and the basement kitchen the
metalwork shop.  This 'temporary' arrangement lasted 17 years, and the LEA began
to realise the need for a more suitable home; in 1938 the school was transferred
to new premises at Stoke, in the former Stoke Military Hospital.  On February
14, 1939, the Junior Tech and three other boys' schools (Valletort Senior, Tamar
Central and Stoke Senior) were instituted into the converted hospital premises.
However, within eight months the order was given to evacuate the premises within
24 hours; the Second World War had arrived.

"For a year the school was accommodated within the Cobourg Street Secondary
School, and this was followed by another temporary measure, an offer to use
Mount Street Board School (it had been the first board school to have been built
in Plymouth in 1876).  Here the school remained until the new Widey Technical
School opened in 1959.

"Mr GW Turpitt was the headmaster for the greater part of those early years,
having been the school's first-ever head in 1911, and staying on until 1947.  He
was followed by Mr ER Harris from Devonport High School (which had moved into
the old Military Hospital after the war). The Junior Tech adopted the crest of
Lord Mount Edgcumbe, presumably when they were based in Stonehouse; I don't know
if they had one before that, but an early school motto was 'Get on or get out' .

"As well as helping boys to find their vocation, studying maths and mechanical
engineering, practical and theoretical, the school catered well for sports",
adds Len, "playing  rugby, football and cricket at Marsh Mills, Collins Park and
other places.

"Most of my contemporaries took the dockyard exam, sitting in one of those rooms
at the back of Mutley Baptist Church.  The dockyard used to take around 260
apprentices every year, and not everyone got through.  Even when you did, there
was still plenty more schooling to be done if you wanted to get on."

As an apprentice, he did a lot of work in the basement of the old Tech in
Glanville Street. "You used to be able to look down into it."

Len spent all his working life in the Yard,  apart from a four-year spell in the
Merchant Navy with Cunard in his early twenties: "I worked on the Mauretania and
the Queen Mary; it was good experience, but not my sort of life.

"I was still single, but staff weren't allowed to talk to passengers unless you
were spoken to first, and anyone caught with a lady passenger in their cabin was
sacked on the spot!"

It's now 19 years since Len left the Yard, and 60 years since he left school, so
putting names to faces isn't easy, but he enjoys looking back, and wrote a book
on Holbeton (his second home for many years) in the early days of his
retirement.

past history reveals that some 5,000 boys passed through the school over the
years.

"The school evolved from a small group of students based in the old Plymouth
Technical College in 1911. By 1914 the group had met the necessary criteria and
were officially recognised by the local education authority and named the
Plymouth Junior Technical School.

"In 1921 the accommodation situation at the college had become a problem, and
this was temporarily solved by sending the young school to the former Durnford
Hotel, and World War One hospital for Army officers, in Stonehouse.

"The billiard room became the carpenter's shop and the basement kitchen the
metalwork shop.  This 'temporary' arrangement lasted 17 years, and the LEA began
to realise the need for a more suitable home; in 1938 the school was transferred
to new premises at Stoke, in the former Stoke Military Hospital.  On February
14, 1939, the Junior Tech and three other boys' schools (Valletort Senior, Tamar
Central and Stoke Senior) were instituted into the converted hospital premises.
However, within eight months the order was given to evacuate the premises within
24 hours; the Second World War had arrived.

"For a year the school was accommodated within the Cobourg Street Secondary
School, and this was followed by another temporary measure, an offer to use
Mount Street Board School (it had been the first board school to have been built
in Plymouth in 1876).  Here the school remained until the new Widey Technical
School opened in 1959.

"Mr GW Turpitt was the headmaster for the greater part of those early years,
having been the school's first-ever head in 1911, and staying on until 1947.  He
was followed by Mr ER Harris from Devonport High School (which had moved into
the old Military Hospital after the war). The Junior Tech adopted the crest of
Lord Mount Edgcumbe, presumably when they were based in Stonehouse; I don't know
if they had one before that, but an early school motto was 'Get on or get out' .

"As well as helping boys to find their vocation, studying maths and mechanical
engineering, practical and theoretical, the school catered well for sports",
adds Len, "playing  rugby, football and cricket at Marsh Mills, Collins Park and
other places.

"Most of my contemporaries took the dockyard exam, sitting in one of those rooms
at the back of Mutley Baptist Church.  The dockyard used to take around 260
apprentices every year, and not everyone got through.  Even when you did, there
was still plenty more schooling to be done if you wanted to get on."

As an apprentice, he did a lot of work in the basement of the old Tech in
Glanville Street. "You used to be able to look down into it."

Len spent all his working life in the Yard,  apart from a four-year spell in the
Merchant Navy with Cunard in his early twenties: "I worked on the Mauretania and
the Queen Mary; it was good experience, but not my sort of life.

"I was still single, but staff weren't allowed to talk to passengers unless you
were spoken to first, and anyone caught with a lady passenger in their cabin was
sacked on the spot!"

It's now 19 years since Len left the Yard, and 60 years since he left school, so
putting names to faces isn't easy, but he enjoys looking back, and wrote a book
on Holbeton (his second home for many years) in the early days of his
retirement.

Babies welcomed to the world in holiday style

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 485 words


Dec. 01--More than a dozen students from Lenape Technical School's Life Skills
program are making sure babies born in Armstrong County this month are in the
Christmas spirit.

This marks the first time the program's students made ACMH Hospital's obstetrics
unit about two dozen stockings and Santa caps for babies born in December, said
Tonilynne Stirling, president of the ACMH Auxiliary.

"When a newborn baby is ready to go home, the nurses will be able to bring the
child to its parents wearing the cap, nestled in the stocking," Stirling said.
"Taking a new baby home is special to begin with, but having a holiday keepsake
to mark the occasion is also a nice way to celebrate the holidays."

The Life Skills program, which is designed for students with intellectual
disabilities, has been working with the hospital's auxiliary on several
projects, ranging from preparing monthly newsletters for shipping, to making
about 150 candy cane ornaments to hand out to patients around Christmas, said
teacher Mari Zilla.

But making the stockings and caps has easily been a student favorite, Zilla
said.

"It's taken about two weeks of work to make the caps and stockings, but they
absolutely loved every second of it," Zilla said. "Our students are fascinated
by the babies and are excited to get to see the babies in the stockings and
caps."

The project is just one of many involving students from Lenape Technical School
volunteering at the East Franklin hospital, Stirling said.

Students from Lenape Technical School's Natural Resources program has been
helping with landscaping and maintaining gardens, trees and plants around the
hospital grounds, while students from the Sports Medicine program have been
helping with a variety of medical-related tasks throughout the facility,
Stirling said.

Patients have also been receiving books at the hospital, which have been
organized and distributed by students in the school's Book Club and Honors
English class, she added.

"We have a very good partnership with Lenape Technical School," Stirling said.
"It's nice to see the students feel good about giving back to the community and
volunteering their time at the hospital."

Zilla said the Life Skills program aims to teach students job skills, to help
them secure gainful employment once they graduate from high school. She also
aims to teach her students about the benefits of helping others.

"These types of projects teach them the joy of giving, versus just receiving,"
Zilla said. "Anytime we can connect our students with their community, it not
only shows them how good it can feel to help others, but also connects them with
potential employers."

CMCH Larkana's uplift works in jeopardy

SECTION: Vol. VIII No. 1055

LENGTH: 384  words


The development works of Chandka Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Larkana, is
affected due to non- availability of qualified civil and electrical engineers as
these posts are lying vacant since their sanction two years ago. Previously
Executive Engineer (XEN), Provincial Buildings Division, Larkana, was providing
technical support and supervising the construction of the buildings but now it
has been refused because the Chief Engineer has not yet asked his XEN in Larkana
to extend his technical support to CMCH projects whereas in other teaching
hospitals, these XENs are extending their support in Nawabshah, Sukkur and LUMS.
Sindh government recently released M and R budget five months late, but tenders
have not yet been floated due to single reason of non-availability of civil
engineer who will make proper tender documents.

Dr Munir Jokhio, CMCH Medical Superintendent (MS) in this connection wrote a
letter to Health Secretary for filling the vacant posts on merit but in vain so
far as if it is not his job to ensure proper utilization of tax payer's money.
The then Sindh Chief Secretary issued minutes of meeting on 31.7.2008 wherein it
was decided that all development funds will be placed at the disposal of the
concerned MSes of all the Teaching Hospitals of the province to ensure speedy
work and timely completion. It was further mentioned in these minutes that
concerned XEN of the district will provide technical support  and  supervise the
works but it was discontinued by the XEN Provincial Buildings Division, Larkana,
during the last financial year 2014-15 due to which the projects which were to
be completed after June 2015 are still incomplete, MS informed the health
secretary. The hospital has become handicap to manage development projects
properly without provision of technical support and supervision, further wrote
the MS in his letter. If the Sindh government is sincere to completion of these
lingering projects and M and R works, then it should immediately direct
Commissioner Larkana Division to provide services of an expert XEN of Works  and
Services Department or Provincial Buildings Division immediately to the CMCH to
complete all required technical formalities for proper utilization of funds
otherwise it is feared that these schemes will never be completed.

One dead, two hurt in clashes

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS, Pg. 14

LENGTH: 230 words


   CLASHES between knife-wielding black and Asian youths ended with the murder
of an 18-year-old student and the stabbing of two other teenagers.

The victims - all male Somali youths in their late teens - were "confronted" by
five or six black and Asian youths near Southgate tube station, north London.

The Somali youths had been walking with two other youths just before 1pm when
the incident occurred.

Two of the victims staggered into Southgate police station.

One had a stab wound to his back and collapsed at the front desk.

The youth, an 18-year-old student at nearby Southgate Technical College, was
airlifted to hospital but died soon afterwards.

The second victim sustained minor cuts to his arm. He was treated in hospital.

Soon afterwards, a third youth was found in the grounds of Southgate Technical
College, also suffering from stab wounds.

He was being treated in hospital last night. His injuries are not thought to be
life-threatening.

A youth was arrested near the technical college in connection with the stabbings
and was in custody at a north London police station.

The principal of Southgate Technical College, which only began its academic year
yesterday, confirmed the dead youth was one of his students.

Michael Blagden said: "Our first thoughts are with the family of this young man.
We extend our deepest sympathy."

A teenage model-maker lost three fingers after a 'crude experiment' went wrong
in his bedroom yesterday.

The college student had been building a propulsion unit for his model boat using
match heads when it exploded, blowing three fingers off his left hand.

The youth, who has not been named, was at his parents' home in Darlington, Co
Durham, when the accident happened.

The boy, thought to be 16 or 17, and a student at Darlington Technical College,
was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital and then transferred to
Middlesbrough's James Cook Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for
injuries and burns to his hand.

A Durham Police spokesman said: 'A young model-making enthusiast was badly hurt
when a crude experiment went wrong.

'The teenager, who is not being identified, was working in a bedroom at his
parents' home when there was an explosion that blew three fingers off his left
hand.

'Police called to the house said he had been building a propulsion unit for his
model boat using a carbon dioxide canister.

'He was filling a container with sulphur recovered from the heads of matches
when the explosion occurred.'

Technicians strike adds to the miseries of Polyclinic patients

BYLINE: Rahul Basharat

SECTION: Vol. 31 No. 45

LENGTH: 532  words


The strike of technical staff at Federal Government Polyclinic Hospital (FGPH),
owing to non-payment of salaries, on Wednesday has added to the miseries of
patients.

Around 100 junior technical staff of the hospital held a strike in the hospital
due to non-payment of salaries for last nine months.

The scale-9 employees of the hospital applied against the vacancies in 2013;
however, the hiring procedure was halted and the employees were not issued
appointment letters.

Later on, the case was raised in Islamabad High Court (IHC) and after three
years court issued orders of regularizing of the technical staff to Ministry of
Capital Administration  and  Development Division (CADD).

Despite of court orders the ministry has not paid wages to the junior technical
staff for last nine months.

Talking to The Nation, a lab technician Muhammad Javed said that the candidates
cleared all process of test and interview after which merit list was finalised.

'Instead of releasing the salaries, the hospital administration has started
issuing explanation letters to the technicians,' he said.

President Staff Welfare Association Ilyas Raja said that employees are paying
their services to hospital without any salary.

He said the ambiguous joining status has resulted in this situation where
ministry is not paying the salaries.

According to documents available with The Nation, FGPH in August 2016 issued
appointment letters against junior technician posts.

'You will be entitled to the starting salary of (BPS-09) plus usual allowance as
admissible to the Federal Govt Employees of your category,' states the letter.

'Your appointment in the first instance will be on probation for a period of one
year which if not terminated will be deemed to have been extended for another
year,' the letter states.

IHC, in 2016, in its order has stated that the authority issued order for 102
employees who were declared eligible. Out of 102, 67 candidates joined their
duty, but their salaries have not been released because of pendency of the
matter before court.

The court in its order stated, 'Since they have been declared eligible,
therefore no hurdle remained in their way to pay their salaries as required by
law. To that extent, their grievance are redressed, therefore the authorities
concerned are directed to issue their salaries.'

Talking to The Nation, a senior doctor who wished anonymity said that court had
issued the orders of salaries and joining of these employees but ministry has
prolonged the matter.

He said that the strike badly affected the services and system of hospital.

'Dispensary and laboratory services were not available for patients and they
suffered because of it,' he said.

He said ministry is confused on releasing the salaries of these employees.

Spokesperson FGPH Dr Imtiaz talking to The Nation said that court last month
issued detailed judgment regarding issuing of salaries and hospital
administration is mulling to implement the decision.

'A policy is required for the implementation of orders and hospital
administration will soon hold a meeting with ministry to resolve the matter,' he
said.

He said that it was a symbolic strike and the technical staff later joined their
duties.

NEW ERA IN LEARNING;
 COVENTRY AND WARWICKSHIRE HOSPITAL; SITE IDENTIFIED AS IDEAL LOCATION

BYLINE: ANDREW HUTSON SPLIT SITE: The vision for the future would mean most, if
not all, of the Tile Hill; operation ending, as well as the end for the Butts
college building; AMBITIOUS PLANS: College principal Paul Taylor; ON BORROWED
TIME: Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital, whose services will eventually move to
the Walsgrave superhospital, leaving a large site for redevelopment ROYAL VISIT:
The Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, sees the college building take shape in
the 30s

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2,3

LENGTH: 776 words


PAUL TAYLOR, principal of City College Coventry, which was formed a year ago
through the merger of Tile Hill College and Coventry Technical College, has a
bold pounds 100million vision for a new campus.

He says creating a new college, possibly on the current site of Coventry and
Warwickshire Hospital, would lead to massive efficiency savings and bring the
college into the 21st century.

"We are estimating the total cost as something in the order of pounds 25million
to pounds 30million from the college's point of view," he said yesterday, as he
revealed the news ahead of the college's first birthday.

The "learning village" - which could possibly include a school - would be
developed in partnership with the council.

"For the whole learning village, it's obviously significantly more and we are
looking at potentially in excess of pounds 100million," Mr Taylor added. "We
would be seeking to build a brand-new, much more accessible college that would
be a much better place for students to learn in and enable the college to
continue to invest in students' learning from the savings in running costs."

A new college on the hospital site would fit neatly into plans to regenerate the
area when most of the services move to the Walsgrave superhospital site.

Mr Taylor said excess capacity at the Butts college had led to excess overheads.

"We've got too much space and much of it is not suitable for a modern college -
the Butts building itself is highly energy-inefficient.

"We would be able to create a better learning environment for students and it
would also mean the college would become more efficient. That would also benefit
the students because I can put more money into direct learning resources.

"There's an understanding with the Learning and Skills Council that the college
will seek to build new accommodation.

"That would include the disposal of the Butts site and most, if not all, of the
Tile Hill site."

News of the possible closure of the college at Butts comes the week after work
started to transform the adjoining stadium into a new ground for Coventry Rugby
Club.

That work alone will drastically alter the Spon End landscape.

What is now a derelict former athletics and sports pitch surrounded by a banked
cycle circuit is being bulldozed to create a pounds 10,000-seater rugby ground,
to open in a year's time.

The development also includes office buildings and accommodation blocks to house
sports academy students.

Key college dates

COVENTRY Technical College has a history dating back to 1828 and was founded as
the Mechanics' Institution at 69 Hertford Street.

1855 Renamed the Coventry Institute.

1888 A new Technical Institute was opened in an old textile warehouse on Earl
Street.

1926 The institute qualified to become a Technical College.

1919 The Pool Meadow site was too small and the building was built at its site
at The Butts at a cost of pounds 145,000.

1969 Tile Hill College of Further Education opened in 1969 and cost pounds
750,000 to build.

The merger of Coventry Technical College and Tile Hill College into City College
dated back to a report by Ofsted into further education provision in the city in
2000.

The merger was dogged by financial problems but made a profit in 2001.

Academy for the stars - and cars - of the future

City College Coventry has around 400 courses for its 18,000 students.

Academic and vocational courses are offered and range from building and
engineering to fashion and performing arts.

The merger of Coventry Technical College and Tile Hill College in City College
Coventry provided significant investment in performing arts facilities at the
Butts Centre, including two flexible performance areas and a new dance studio.

Work is also due to start to complete the conversion of the former engineering
workshop block at the Butts into a new City College Academy for the Performing
and Creative Arts.

It has excellent links with the car industry and manages all the training for
Jaguar and, with Sutton Coldfield College, manages the training for BMW at Hams
Hall.

It provides engineering training for Aston Martin and Peugeot and is seeking
Centres of Vocational Excellence status in auto design and engineering and
passenger service vehicles engineering.

Body of baby found in west Cork

BYLINE: Barry Roche, Southern Correspondent

SECTION: Ireland; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 250 words


Gardai who are investigating the discovery of the body of a newborn baby boy in
a house near Dunmanway in west Cork are awaiting the results of a post-mortem
today to try and establish if the baby was stillborn.

Officers were alerted after the parents of a young woman discovered the
decomposed body wrapped in clothing in an annexe off a bathroom in their house
in the area at about lunchtime yesterday.

Garda technical experts sealed off the house and carried out a preliminary
examination of the scene.

Following consultation with the Garda Technical Bureau in Dublin, they requested
the services of the Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster.

Dr Bolster carried out a preliminary examination of the body at the scene before
it was removed to Cork University Hospital where she will carry out a full
post-mortem today.

Detectives believe the body was in the house for over a week as the woman who
they believe is its mother checked into hospital a week ago for psychiatric
treatment.

The woman's parents were shocked by the discovery and were being comforted by
relatives yesterday.

"They're in a terrible state. They had no idea that their daughter was pregnant
and they're very worried and concerned about her welfare," said a local source.

A Garda spokesman said: "We are handling the matter with great sensitivity given
its delicate nature and our desire to protect the privacy of the family and the
woman at the centre of this sad and tragic case."

Hospitals target readmissions;
10-20 in state to join study to cut costs, improve quality

BYLINE: JAY GREENE

LENGTH: 460 words


A group of 10 to 20 Michigan hospitals will join hospitals in Massachusetts and
Washington in a four-year study to develop processes that could reduce avoidable
rehospitalizations by 30 percent and save billions of dollars in unnecessary
health care costs.

National data show that nearly 20 percent of all Medicare patients are
readmitted to hospitals within 30 days and 33 percent are readmitted within 90
days, costing Medicare $17 billion dollars in 2004 alone, according a study in
the April 1 New England Journal of Medicine.

The Michigan hospitals, which are expected to be named in early May, are part of
a project funded by a $1 million grant from the Commonwealth Fund with technical
assistance provided by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.

A steering committee for the project in Michigan will be coordinated by the
Michigan Health and Hospital Association and MPRO, a Farmington Hills-based
quality improvement organization.

"We are proud of Michigan taking the lead in one of the many small areas of
needed change in health care processes which can lead to significant and major
savings in costs and improvement in quality," said Larry Horwitz, president of
the Economic Alliance for Michigan, a Novi-based coalition of businesses and
unions.

Horwitz said he believes Michigan's hospitals will provide a national model for
reducing costs and improving quality.

In the first phase of the project, MHA and MPRO will appoint a steering
committee of hospital executives and other health care providers to oversee the
efforts to reduce readmission rates and improve patient satisfaction. Up to four
project leaders will serve as improvement advisers to the participating
hospitals. They will receive technical training from the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement.

Part of the technical training will include methods to improve care coordination
after patients are discharged from hospitals.

The study found that 50 percent of patients who returned to hospitals within 30
days of undergoing treatment other than surgery had not seen a doctor before
they were readmitted.

MHA and MPRO also are expected to include nursing home officials and physicians
in the hospital project to improve care coordination.

The goals of the readmission reduction project include:

-- Reduce 30-day rehospitalization rates by 30 percent.

-- Increase patient and family satisfaction with post-hospital care and with
care coordination.

-- Coordinate existing state and national quality-improvement activities to
reduce rehospitalizations.

-- Provide examples in which providers, including nursing homes and physician
offices, have dramatically improved transitions and reduced rehospitalizations.

-- Identify and develop approaches to remove systemic barriers to reducing
rehospitalizations.

UCSF Responds to AFSCME's Plans for Two-Day Strike

LENGTH: 454  words


New Delhi, May 13 -- The American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees (AFSCME) union announced on May 10 that its patient care technical
workers unit will strike on May 21 and 22 across the University of California
system.



AFSCME's patient care technical workers (EX Unit) will be joined on the picket
lines by AFSCME's service workers (SX Unit), who will engage in a sympathy
strike at UC campuses.

UPTE's health care professionals unit (HX), which includes pharmacists, also
announced it will strike in sympathy and it is possible that members of other
unions will also join the strike, although strikes are illegal for members of
unions currently engaged in bargaining or still under contract.

Physicians and nurses will not be on strike and will continue to provide care to
patients.

UC officials say a strike involving patient care technical employees at its five
UC medical centers, including UCSF, would pose an imminent threat to public
health and safety and improperly withhold health care from members of the
public.

Because of that threat, the University said it will seek a restraining order
against an AFSCME strike.

A strike by AFSCME patient care technical workers, and other union workers who
join in sympathy, could involve more than 4,200 employees at UCSF, which
operates one of five medical centers in the 10-campus UC system.

The majority of these workers take care of patients and their families at UCSF
Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. They include patient care
assistants, respiratory therapists, sterile processing technicians, hospital lab
technicians, pharmacy and imaging technicians.

The strike is also expected to affect patient care services at other UCSF
clinical sites, including San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, the
dental clinics and Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute.

Chancellor Sue Desmond-Hellmann, MD, MPH, and UCSF Medical Center CEO Mark Laret
are sending a communication to the UCSF community today that says, in part:

"UCSF is a leading university, with top-ranked academics and research programs.
Our UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital rank among the
nation's best hospitals and consistently exceed the most widely used patient
satisfaction and safety measures in the nation. We ask all employees to continue
placing UCSF's mission of improving health - and particularly the interests of
our patients who entrust their lives in us every day - as a top priority.

"If AFSCME goes through with its strike plans and UPTE with its sympathy strike
plans, all UCSF employees - including represented employees - would still be
allowed to come to work. We encourage you to do so in service of our patients
and our community."

Nurses unionize, join Teamsters

BYLINE: RYAN DAVIS

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 443 words

DATELINE: HUDSON



(ran PW, PS editions)

Nurses at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point became on Friday night the
newest members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

"It was a very exciting moment," said Bob Maldunis, the regional organizer for
the Georgia-Florida conference of Teamsters. "It was a nailbiter."

Even after the election, the fate of workers in the hospital's technical unit
remains unresolved.

After two days of voting, the secret ballots were tallied in the hospital
cafeteria. The nurses voted 167-136 in favor of joining the union. The technical
unit workers voted 51-46 in favor of unionizing, but seven ballots have been
challenged and remain unopened, Maldunis said.

Throughout the world, the Teamsters represent 1.4-million workers, including
500,000 health care workers. But the Bayonet Point nurses will be the first
hospital workers to join the 3,500-member Teamsters' Local 79 Chapter, which
stretches from Citrus County in the north to Naples in the south.

The nurses and technical workers total about 450 employees.

"It's a big step," Maldunis said. "You go from the old myth that Teamsters are
nothing but a bunch of truck drivers, but now you see the step that
professionals are unionizing because they feel they need to.

"It just makes us stronger."

Nurses celebrated by popping champagne corks in the hospital parking lot. Pay
and working conditions led them to unionize, Maldunis said. The nurses were
concerned about the hospital bringing in temporary nurses.

They needed a majority of the vote to win the election.

In about a week, Maldunis said, the Teamsters will send the hospital a letter to
set up bargaining dates for a contract.

"It's not going to be a quick change," Maldunis said. "It's going to be
difficult to negotiate a contract."

At the same time, the Teamsters and the hospital will try to reach an agreement
about the fate of seven ballots cast by technical unit workers known as coders.
The Teamsters consider them to be clerical workers and do no think their votes
should count. The hospital thinks they should.

If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, they will have a hearing before the
National Labor Relations Board, Maldunis said.

There had been previous attempts to unionize workers at Bayonet Point, but this
was the first time workers had circulated a petition that led to a vote,
Maldunis said.

Sometime next month between 200 and 300 of Bayonet Point's nonprofessional and
service employees, including phlebotomists and kitchen workers, will vote on
joining the Teamsters, he said. A date has not been set.

BYLINE:  Our Staff Reporter

SECTION: Vol. XXVIII No. 001

LENGTH: 371  words


Punjab Minister for Ushar and Zakat Malik Nadeem Kamran has said that the Punjab
government has been pursuing a comprehensive strategy to provide technical
education to youth and free medical facilities to the needy patients. He said
that funds were being provided to the technical training institutions and
government hospitals in this regard.

The minister claimed that Rs27.75 million had been provided to institutions in

said that the government was providing technical education to students to help
them stand on their feet and play their role in the national development.

He emphasised that transparency should be maintained in the distribution of

informed that the Punjab government was providing funds worth Rs250 million to
39 hospitals across the province to improve healthcare facilities for the poor.
Similarly Rs900 million are being spent on 166 vocational institutes to provide
different skills the youth.

MMAP wants PEC abolition: Muttahida Mahaz Asataza Pakistan (MMAP) Vice chairman

injustice with students of Class 5, and 8th and wastage of public money and
time.

He demanded that the Class 5 and 8th examination should be conducted at district
level instead of provincial level to end inconvenience to the students and their
parents. He alleged that ill-planned and imprudent policies of the Punjab
government had ruined the education system, adding that syllabus for primary

prescribed for nursery class students, which was more than a burden on minor
children and affect their mental and physical growth.

Inquiry into murder of mother, sons to focus on family home area
Post-mortems show multiple injuries as knife, hurley removed from house for
examination

BYLINE: By ELAINE EDWARDS

SECTION: CITY EDITION; HOME NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 480 words

DATELINE: CASTLEDALY


The Garda murder investigation into the deaths of a mother and her two young
sons in Castledaly, Co Westmeath, will centre on the immediate area of the
family home where they were found dead on Saturday.

Ms Debbie Fox (30) and her sons, Trevor (9) and Killian (7), were killed in an
apparent attack at their home in the village between Moate and Athlone on Friday
night or early Saturday morning.

Their remains were removed to Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar
for post-mortems, which showed they had all sustained serious multiple injuries.

It is understood all three had stab wounds, and possibly other injuries
inflicted with a blunt instrument.

A knife and a hurley stick found in the house were removed for examination by
the Garda Technical Bureau. Mr Greg Fox (32), the husband and father of the dead
woman and children, was found unconscious in the family shop adjoining the
house. He was removed by ambulance to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, Co
Galway. His injuries were described yesterday as "not serious" and his condition
was comfortable.

Mr Fox was moved to a private room in the hospital yesterday, where a Garda
presence was being maintained last night. The Garda has confirmed that officers
will interview Mr Fox when he is discharged from hospital.

The Technical Bureau and local gardai were at the scene of the incident
throughout Saturday afternoon. The Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Marie
Cassidy, carried out preliminary examinations of the bodies before they were
removed to hospital.

Supt Kevin Donohoe of Athlone station, who is in charge of the investigation,
described the scene inside the house on Saturday morning as "horrific".

He did not wish to speculate on what may have happened, pending an inquiry.

Ms Fox and her two children were found dead at their home by neighbours on
Saturday morning. Local people became concerned when they noticed the family
shop had not opened for business.

When gardai gained access, Ms Fox was found dead in the kitchen with serious
injuries. The two boys were found dead in separate bedrooms, also with serious
injuries. There was a lot of blood at the scene, Garda sources said.

The post-mortems showed that the three members of the family had suffered
multiple wounds, believed to include stab wounds and possibly other injuries.

The Fox family moved to Castledaly about 18 months ago. They ran a small shop
and petrol station, which they had bought from a local man, Mr Sean Kelly. Ms
Fox was from Portarlington, Co Laois. Her husband, Mr Greg Fox, is from Dublin.
Ms Fox's family travelled to Mullingar on Friday evening to identify the
remains.

A Garda spokesman said full results from the post-mortems would not be
immediately available.

He confirmed the Garda wished to interview the husband of the dead woman in
connection with the investigation.

Coega projects to create jobs

BYLINE: LONDEKA DLAMINI

LENGTH: 506 words


The refurbishment and upgrading of the Frontier Hospital in Queenstown and
Mjanyana District Hospital in Ngcobo is under way through the Coega Development
Corporation (CDC).

By the end of the projects, more than 1200 jobs and 28 internships, job
opportunities for 1463 technical and lifeskills courses for site workers will
have been created for local communities in the rural areas.

"Our objective with every major project that we facilitate is to leave a
heritage in the form of technical, life and business skills.

"The people and the business owners we have trained now have the skills they
need to qualify for other tenders, or to create projects for themselves," the
CDC unit head of marketing and communications, Ayanda Vilakazi, said.

The corporation will also refurbish clinics in Qebe and Nkwenkwana in Ngcobo and
Isikhoba clinic in Cofimvaba.

The development corporation has retained the skills which built Africa's most
modern industrial development zone (IDZ) and fine-tuned the management systems
to help government agencies such as the provincial department of health to
improve the quality of life for the people of the province.

"We are more concerned with socio-economic transformation rather than maximising
profits.

"That means we spend more time and resources on supporting local small
businesses and training members of the community," Vilakazi said.

Head of recruitment and placement at Coega Human Capital Solutions Duncan
Grenfell said the R247m Frontier Hospital project created 619 jobs, with 428
local people having been provided with job opportunities they would otherwise
not have had.

In addition, 10 internships were provided and 335 youth and 80 women weregiven
the opportunities to work on the project.

Project manager Michael Mabunda said that more than 60 technical skills courses
and life skills courses had been offered to the communities on the R20m
allocated to the project.

In Ngcobo, about 34 people attended technical skills courses during the life of
the R19.4m Mjanyana Hospital project. Additionally, five interns have been given
the opportunity to work on the project and a total of 76 jobs were created in
Ngcobo.

At the nearly R20m Qebe Clinic project, about  158 jobs were created, 99 of
which went to people from the local community.

Four local contractors have been involved in the project. There were seven
internship opportunities for local graduates. During the project about 560
technical and life skills courses were provided.

At the R20m Nkwenkwana Clinic 199 jobs were created with 154 filled by locals.
Eight local contractors worked on the project and some six internship
opportunities for local graduates were created. Workers on site attended about
809 technical and life skills courses.

About 107 locals were given a share of the 160 jobs created by the R20m Isikhoba
Clinic project.

There were five internships for local graduates and 742 technical and life
skills courses presented. Nine local contractors provided a variety of services.

Some 100 Indian military specialists work at Tajik airbase - defence official

LENGTH: 447 words


Text of report by privately-owned Tajik news agency Asia-Plus website

Dushanbe, 8 August: Apart from the 201st Russian military base, Tajikistan
currently hosts an Indian military contingent on its territory.

A source in the Defence Ministry of the country has told Asia-Plus that
representatives of the Indian military contingent along with Tajik servicemen
and the 201st Russian military base in Tajikistan are participating in sports
competitions dedicated to the 22nd anniversary of founding of the Air Forces of
Tajikistan, which are taking place from 4 to 12 August.

The head of the press service of the Tajik Defence Ministry, Lt-Col Faridun
Mahmadaliyev, commented on the report. He said 73 Indian servicemen, mostly
military medics, are working under a two-year contract in the military hospital
of the Defence Ministry's military unit 07017, where a new multipurpose military
hospital of the Khatlon garrison, which is named "Friendship Hospital of
Tajikistan and India", was commissioned with the participation of [Tajik
President] Emomali Rahmon in early October 2014.

The hospital was built in the shortest time possible with funding from the
government of India and is equipped with modern medical facilities. The hospital
is designed for 50 beds. Seventy three qualified specialists from India, who
will simultaneously train their Tajik colleagues to work with the advanced
equipment installed in the hospital, will work in the hospital for two years. In
addition, about 100 military specialists of India are working in the Tajik
Defence Ministry's Ayni military airfield, which has been modernized in recent
years with financial and technical assistance from India. The airfield was
officially commissioned in early September of 2010.

The Indian military personnel are employed at the airfield as technical staff,
as well as trainers for refresher training of Tajik military pilots.

The most important military facility was equipped with modern technical and
navigational facilities worth 70m dollars by Tajik and Indian experts in recent
years. The military airfield turned into the largest airfield capable of taking
all available types of aircraft in the world, because its runway is 3,200
metres.

The airfield has a flight operations centre and navigation centre equipped with
modern technology, and its work is coordinated with the activities of other
relevant institutions of airports and navigation centres of the country. A
training building, where officers, soldiers and other professionals of the
country's air forces can learn and improve their skills, was also built in the
airfield .

Soon, city's govt hospitals to get German hand to cut wastage

BYLINE: Vidya Krishnan

LENGTH: 378  words

DATELINE: New Delhi


If all goes as planned, state-run hospitals will soon be working in clockwork
precision, German style.

The state Health department has approached GTZ - German Technical Cooperation -
for technical support to reduce wastage and improve resource utilisation under
the Indo-German agreement for the health sector.

The public-private partnership project will introduce better quality control in
13 secondary hospitals in the Capital by October-end, Principal Secretary
(Health) J P Singh said.

Introducing checklists so that doctors do not run out of drugs in the OPD is a
basic example to make a state-run hospital work like a well-oiled machine.

Simple changes like these introduced by GTZ have already proven effective in
state-run hospitals in Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal, officials said.

The GTZ will be focussing on four areas: institutional development, management
capacity development, clinical capacity development, and consumer empowerment.
"GTZ will give us technical support, help us manage patient load efficiently and
also improve standards of services in hospitals," Singh said. "We will start
with 13 secondary hospitals and the project should be operational by this
month-end.

"The state government will invest in infrastructure but the expertise will come
from GTZ."

The project includes implementation of basic techniques like a token system for
patients or helping patients queue up so that doctors do not waste time in
controlling crowds. "We will facilitate a quality improvement process and set
standards. We will try out some mechanisms that lead to better utilisation of
existing facilities," said Amit Phaliwal, senior technical specialist in quality
management with GTZ's health sector support.

At the outset, the hospitals have been given a self assessment exercise in which
they have to mark themselves on 1100 criteria.

"Based on feedback from this exercise, we will know what standards they are
complying with and the gaps that need to be filled," Pahliwal said. "We aim to
remove the bottlenecks in OPD, IPD and OTs in (Delhi's government) hospitals.
One simple way will be to have a general practitioner examine the patient and
direct them to specialists, instead of the current practice of all patients
crowding the Casualty/Medicine department."

LENGTH: 281 words

DATELINE: MARGAO


ARGAO, Nov. 14 -- Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that work on the
district hospital project in Margao will be completed with "super fast speed,"
even as he announced that the top two floors of the hospital building will be
utilised for para-medical (technical) courses.

After inspecting the district hospital under construction, Parrikar told the
media that the hospital work is in full swing. "I have not set any deadline for
the completion of the project. But, one should know that most of my projects
have been completed in super fast time. The district hospital project will not
be an exception," he said.

Replying to a question, the Chief Minister said that the first three floors will
be utilised to house the hospital, while the top two floors will have a separate
entrance and would be used to run the para medical (technical) courses. "The
technical courses will include x-ray technicians, MRI, CT-scan. Even machines
can be maintained at a lower end," he said, adding that the drawings of the top
two floors will be completed and submitted to the contractor by November-end.

The Chief Minister, who also visited the multipurpose school complex at Borda,
said that a government run college will start functioning from the complex from
the coming academic year. "I have inspected the school complex since nothing had
moved in the direction of the new college though a decision was taken three
years ago. We will tender work on the new college premises within a month," he
added.

Cancer Genetics Launches Digital Platform to Enable Collaboration with Community
Hospitals, Laboratories

LENGTH: 384  words


Jan. 20 -- US-based Cancer Genetics, Inc. issued the following news release:

Cancer Genetics, Inc., (Nasdaq:CGIX) ("CGI" or "the company"), an emerging
leader in DNA-based cancer diagnostics, announced today the launch of their
ExpandDxTM collaborative testing program. CGI's ExpandDx program, which utilizes
VENTANA digital pathology technology from Roche, allows community-based
hospitals and pathology labs to partner with CGI through remote consultations,
and enables access to a broader range of tests that expand the clinical testing
capabilities of community labs and hospitals. The technical-only testing service
provides community hospitals and pathology labs with the most advanced testing
technologies available, and facilitates increased collaboration on both atypical
and difficult cancer cases.

"We are very excited to partner with Cancer Genetics to provide comprehensive
digital pathology solutions through their ExpandDx testing program," said Rod
Cotton, Senior Vice President at Roche Diagnostics Corporation. "This new
service is an example of their innovation and leadership in the field of cancer
diagnostics. It will enable a more collaborative and responsive diagnosis
process for community-based pathologists and help them fulfill their mission to
empower personalized cancer treatment."

Through CGI's ExpandDx collaborative testing program, the technical component
will be performed at CGI laboratories, and clinicians will have the option of
interpreting and signing out their patients' test results. By allowing
clinicians to sign out cases remotely and share cases with other team members,
the program enables smaller labs to manage resources while still leveraging
CGI's unique tests and expertise in oncology diagnostics.

"As care centers and clinicians look for ways to improve cost efficiency,
technical-only testing offers opportunity for providers to more actively
collaborate in the diagnosis process and manage costs for patients," said Lan
Wang, M.D., Medical Director at Cancer Genetics. "CGI's ExpandDx technical-only
testing will ensure that community-based hospitals and pathology labs have
access to the same cutting-edge oncology testing available at larger centers,
and will allow the clinical community to collaborate on difficult cases."

LENGTH: 402 words

for Lassa fever is now

From Paul Osuyi, Asaba

THE number of persons under surveillance in Delta State for Lassa fever is now
55, Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nichols Azinge disclosed in Asaba, yesterday.
Following the death of a medical doctor, who was diagnosed of the disease, 32
persons believed to have contacts with the deceased were quarantined. The number
rose to 40 as the state government intensified efforts to prevent the spread of
the disease.


The late doctor, who ran a private health facility, Rainbow Hospital in Umuaji
area of Asaba, had gone for treatment at another private facility, El-Comfort
Hospital at the Bonsaac area.
From El-Comfort Hospital, he was referred to Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching
Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi, Anambra State where he died.
His blood sample, which was taken to Irrua Specialist Hospital, Edo State tested
positive to the disease caused by the eight-breasted rat specie. He has since
been buried according the specification of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Speaking yesterday when he received in audience the Federal Government rapid
response team on a technical assistance mission, Azinge explained that the 55
persons under watch might have had contact with the dead doctor.
Azinge advised residents not to panic as the state government had put necessary
measures in place to curtail the spread of the disease and in control of the
situation.
The five-man technical assistant team made up of experts from the Nigerian
Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Nigerian Field Epidemiology and Laboratory
Training Programme (NFELPT) was deplored by the Federal Government to help in
tackling the disease.
The team has been in the state for some days working with the state's
epidemiologist and the disease surveillance and notification officer to assess
what has been done so far and proffer technical assistance in closing whatever
perceived gaps.
Azinge said the four persons earlier found negative had not shown any symptoms
of the disease, adding that both the El-Comfort Hospital and Rainbow Hospital
remained shut.
He reiterated that previous committees set up to tackle the disease had been
reactivated while awareness campaigns through the various mass media to
enlighten the public on how the disease was transmitted and could be prevented
to forestall its spread had been stepped up.

West Virginia Hospital Recovers From Default

                            July 3, 2002, Wednesday

By Alison Vekshin

DATELINE: WASHINGTON



A rural hospital in West Virginia recently was found to be in technical default
for the third time on almost $2 million of revenue bonds due to late payments,
but has since recovered from the default, according to a hospital executive.

The Richwood Area Community Hospital Inc., an acute-care, 46-bed hospital
located in south central West Virginia, was late in making its loan and
deficiency payments and was found to be in default on June 25, Bank One Trust
Co. NA said in a notice to bondholders. The bonds had also been found in
technical default on Dec. 13, 2001, and March 25 of this year.

The bonds were issued by Nicholas County in August 1999 at the request of the
hospital. The county issued $1.4 million of Series A tax-exempt revenue bonds
and $575,000 of Series B taxable revenue bonds.

The bond sale had been prompted by a measure passed by the Legislature in March
1999 that allowed the hospital to add up to 25 long-term care beds to the
existing facility, according to Rush F. Harding, the chief executive officer of
underwriter Crews & Associates Inc.

"They expected a steady cash flow," Harding said. "But the game plan was not put
in place. This contributed to the inability to repay."

Proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank loans, make improvements to
existing facilities, acquire equipment, pay off taxes that were in arrears,
create a $150,000 operating reserve fund, and purchase assets from the Hospital
Corporation of America Inc., which had owned the hospital, Harding said.

The community of Richwood now owns the hospital.

But Elaine Butler, the hospital's chief executive officer, said the late
payments and subsequent technical defaults were caused by a software glitch and
that the problem has now been corrected.

She said the hospital began using new billing software in January.

"There were some glitches in getting that working correctly," which delayed the
processing of various payments made from the state to the hospital, Butler said.
"For that period of time were weren't able to make bond payments on time."

But the hospital is now in compliance with its payment requirements, having made
a payment on June 25, the day the latest technical default notice was issued,
she said.

Butler said the hospital has had its share of financial difficulties. In August
2001, it had to dip into its reserve fund to pay bondholders.

"We have added new services and extended-care beds," she said. "While we showed
a loss last year, year-to-date in 2002 we are showing a positive bottom line as
of May."

This year, the hospital has gone from nine to 21 long-term care beds, which has
generated additional revenue, Butler said. She added that the hospital plans to
add four more long-term care beds.

While the hospital has a lot of short-term debt, it is turning the corner,
according to Shana Phares, assistant secretary of the West Virginia Department
of Health and Human Services. It will catch up on its utility payments in
December and on its back federal and state taxes in March 2003, Phares said.

MUM STABBED TO DEATH;
 TEENS QUIZZED AFTER VICTIM IS FOUND IN BURNING HOUSE

LENGTH: 405 words

HIGHLIGHT: SCENE: Firefighters last night in Greenfields, Kilkenny;;
INVESTIGATION: House at Greenfields Road, Kilkenny, where Christina Quinn was
found last night is sealed off as gardai begin inquiries


A MOTHER was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack and left to burn in a blazing
house last night.

Firefighters found Christina Quinn, 36, in a pool of blood at her home in
Kilkenny.

Two teens were last night being questioned. A Garda source said: "It was a
horrific scene. The woman suffered severe injuries." It is believed Mrs Quinn's
throat had been cut but she was still alive when rescue workers broke into the
blazing house at Greenfields Road in the city.

A Garda source said they were awaiting the results of a post mortem before
launching a murder inquiry.

He added: "The firefighters took Mrs Quinn away from the flames and I believe
she died on the path outside.

"There was a call to the emergency services at 5pm and two units of Kilkenny
fire brigade responded. They were quickly followed by an ambulance and Gardai.

"Firefighters were still at the scene two hours later having dealt with a minor
blaze."

Her body was removed by ambulance the short distance to St Luke's Hospital,
Kilkenny.

Locals said Mrs Quinn's husband Aidan, who was in the Army, was not living in
the family home.

Neighbour Ann Ryan added that the community was in disbelief at the killing.

She said: "We still can't believe this has happened that to such a lovely woman.
We are all in total shock.

"Mrs Quinn was a lovely, quiet, kind woman. She was always in good form and was
liked by everyone in the area.

"She worked in the local hotel and just lived for her children.

"She was from a very respectable family and was well-liked.

"The whole of city are still trying to take in what happened. It is just beyond
belief."

Mrs Quinn was a member of the well-known Connolly family from Stephen Street in
the city.

She is believed to have been friends with another man who suffered a family
tragedy a few years ago when his brother and two nephews died.

A post mortem was being carried out on the young mother last night at Waterford
Regional Hospital.

A Garda spokesman said: "It's the early stages yet but there is no doubt that we
are treating this death as suspicious.

"The fire broke out shortly after 5pm, but exactly how it started is not yet
known.

"The woman's body was removed to St Lukes Hospital.

"The scene has been preserved and is pending a full technical examination.

"The State Pathologist and a team from the Garda Technical Bureau have been
called in."

issues have emerged adding that the Director General (Design), Building
Department, Government of Sindh is not authenticating the estimate of the
hospital  and  technical sanction of the estimates are not given by competent

NEW HANOVER HOSPITAL / Fake ID leads to arrest of impostor

BYLINE: Victoria Rouch, Staff Writer

SECTION: Local/State; Pg. 1B, 6B

LENGTH: 429 words


It's not unusual to see hospital workers clad in surgical scrubs and lab coats
walking the halls of New Hanover Regional Medical Center.

But Wednesday, a woman dressed like a hospital staff member was arrested and
charged with first-degree trespassing after an employee noticed she was wearing
a fake identification badge.

On Friday, Hospital Special Police Chief Kathy Strawn said there was evidence
that Amanda K. Taylor, 26, may have been using those tactics to wander around in
the hospital unattended since some time in October.

"We do have numerous people who've claimed to have seen her, but we still need
to confirm that," said Chief Strawn, adding that so far there is no indication
Ms. Taylor became involved in patient care.

The State Bureau of Investigation is assisting with the case, which Chief Strawn
said is expected to yield additional charges against Ms. Taylor.

Chief Strawn said investigators are talking to staff about just where Ms. Taylor
- a student at Miller-Motte Technical College - may have gone while in the
hospital.

So far, she said, it has been confirmed that she was seen on both the ninth
floor and in the Pastoral Care Department, which is near the lobby of the
hospital.

Chief Strawn said the identification badge Ms. Taylor was wearing would not have
allowed her entry into some secure areas that are access-controlled, unless she
managed to slip in behind an employee with access to that area.

It was the fake badge - fashioned to resemble official hospital identification -
that piqued the suspicion of an employee in the Pastoral Care Department, Chief
Strawn said.

Medical center employees participate in a "hospital watch program," similar to a
community watch program, that teaches them to be alert for anything that might
compromise patient safety.

Chief Strawn said the scrubs and lab coat Ms. Taylor were wearing were issued
through Miller-Motte, where Ms. Taylor is training to be a medical surgical
technician. Attempts to contact Ms. Taylor Friday afternoon were unsuccessful.

Miller-Motte Technical College Director Ruth Hodge said while the program
entails some clinical training at the hospital, Ms. Taylor had not yet reached
that portion of the course.

Ms. Hodge said school officials met with Ms. Taylor and her mother shortly after
the incident. They plan to notify Ms. Taylor that she is being officially
dismissed from the course.

"She will be put out of the program," she said.

"There's no way we could have anyone in the surg-tech program that could do
something like that."

MPA briefed on Timergara hospital condition; Machinery lying useless due to lack
of staff

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 611

LENGTH: 239  words


Representatives of the Islamic Paramedics, Para-medical association, male nurse
association and class III employees' association Dir Lower on Thursday informed
the newly elected MPA Muzafar Syed that dialysis machine, image machine, blood
plasma machine,

Bronchoscope and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine had been lying useless
in the district head quarter hospital Timergara for years because on
non-availability of technical staff. A meeting in this regard was held at the
hospital where MS Timergara hospital Dr Tahir Bashiruddin Khilji was also
present.

The MPA was informed that the hospital had shortage of drinking water and
electricity. It was said that during power outage the hospital had no
alternative source of lighting in operation theatre as capacity of the existing
power generator was not enough.

The lawmaker was informed that valuable machinery was useless due to no
technical staff in the hospital. The representatives also pointed out that
nonprofessional people had been posted on technical posts during the previous
government.

Speaking on the occasion, Muzafar Syed said he would raise the issue in his
meeting with chief minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa next week. He asked the hospital
staff to perform their duties regularly and wear proper uniform during official
duty. He said that progress of the DHQ hospital Timergara would be evaluated on
monthly basis and official found negligent would be dealt strictly.

Gauhati Medical College and Hospital to repair snags in ICUs

SECTION: GUWAHATI

LENGTH: 228 words


GUWAHATI: Two days after a fire broke out in the neo-natal intensive care unit
(NICU) of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), the hospital authorities
have instructed the PWD (electrical division) to do a thorough survey of the
ICUs in the hospital and repair all defects and technical snags as soon as
possible.

Kabul Saikia, principal of GMCH said, "Besides setting up a three-member enquiry
committee on the fire incident on Friday, we have also engaged the PWD executive
engineer to check the status of other technical snags in the hospital and repair
the same."

"We will also conduct a special audit where we will find out how many areas in
the hospital need technical renovation and we are planning to inform the
government about the total budget required for any kind of renovation," he said.
Saikia said, "As of now, the hospital has over 500 fire extinguishers installed
in different parts of the hospital and we also have trained officials and
hospital staff to tackle such emergencies."

"It is a 45 year-old hospital, so we do not have advanced facilities for fire
safety. But, we will now install all modern equipments required, but it will
take time. There was a fire in one of the hospitals in Kolkata, where many
patients lost their lives. We are taking caution so that nothing unfortunate
happens here," he added.

Govt has taken the opinion of isro for satellite connectivity and technical help

Gandhinagar: Seeking medical advice from an expert based in big cities may soon
come within reach of residents of rural Gujarat, as the state government is
thinking of launching a telemedicine service for the entire state, including
rural and urban areas. The biggest beneficiaries, of course, would be those who
live far away from big cities and commercial hubs.

All the primary health centres, community health centres, referral hospitals,
and government hospitals at district levels, will be connected through this
service. Medical emergency services of 108 will also be linked with the
telemedicine platform to manage trauma conditions.

Processes have already started, including the setting up of technical
infrastructure and arranging experts. "Government has taken the opinion of ISRO
for satellite connectivity and technical help. Department of science and
technology and BISAG of state government are also contributing their bit for the
telemedicine services", said a source familiar to the developments in the
direction of putting in place the technical infrastructure.

An official said, "The telemedicine service project is a long pending issue, but
now the process has been speeded up to set up infrastructure. There would be an
effort to make other well-known medical experts available for their service."

However, the government's target is to provide a service primarily run by the
government's own medical experts.

Specialist doctors, surgeons and therapists working in government hospitals will
be available online for their opinions.

After tasting success in implementing Mukhyamantri Amrutam (MA) scheme and MA
Vatsalya Yojana for economically backward families in state, the telemedicine
service seems to be on top of the government's priority list.

Government plans to interconnect all medical centres across Gujarat with experts
being available online

Crackdown on latecomers

BYLINE: OUR CORRESPONDENT

LENGTH: 396  words


Balurghat, Nov. 4: The superintendent of the Balurghat district hospital today
stopped 30-odd non-medical technical staff members from signing on the
attendance register for coming late, leading to a demonstration by the employees
for more than two hours.

However, the staff members decided to discharge their duties following protest
from the patients, although the day would be marked as a casual leave.

Hospital superintendent Buddhadeb Mandal decided to crack the whip as there were
complaints from patients that most of the 36 technical staff members reported
for duty beyond the scheduled time of 8.30am.

The technical staff members are needed for physiotherapy, eudiometry, pathology
and USG in the outpatient department and wards. Around thousand patients from
far-flung areas of South Dinajpur district visit the 300-bed hospital for
treatment every day.

When Mandal made a sudden visit to the OPD after 8.30 this morning, he found
that only five technical employees were present.

He took away the attendance register and disallowed the other employees from
signing as they started trickling in 45 minutes to one hour late.

The latecomers were taken aback by the superintendent's decision and raised
slogans against him outside his office.

"We were not aware of the timing. We should have been informed earlier. Hence,
it is wrong on the part of the superintendent to prevent us from signing the
attendance," said Prabir Das, one of the late comers.

As the employees continued with their demonstration, the patients in the OPD
felt restless.

"The patients shouted at the agitators and asked them to attend to them
immediately. Realising that the situation was going out of control, the
employees decided to take casual leave and begin their duty," said a hospital
source.

Mandal had earlier tried to bring about a semblance of proper service in the
hospital by offering prizes for doctors and other staff members who discharged
their duties without fail.

"The hospital head used money from his own pocket to reward the employees and it
seemed to have pay dividends initially. But the situation turned worse again,"
said the source.

The hospital head said some employees were making a mockery of the rules.

"How can they say they don't know their duty hours? This is absurd. This cannot
be tolerated. I didn't allow the latecomers to sign on the attendance register
today," said Mandal

Nursing institutions not up to the mark

LENGTH: 284 words

DATELINE: BUTWAL


BUTWAL, Sept. 15 -- Nursing Colleges in Rupandehi are found operational against
the standards stipulated by the Nursing Council and Council of Technical
Education and Vocational Training (CETVT).

Established after taking approval for the purpose of producing technical human
resource in health sector, the colleges have also been charging high fee to
students in a unitary manner.

Ironically, there are no subject faculty, laboratory and library in almost all
colleges here.

In addition, the colleges here have charged Rs. 800,000 to a student for
three-year certificate course.

The existing fee structure of the colleges is maximum expensive than the fee
that of other similar institutions of the country, complained students.

Every nursing college has to make necessary arrangement of hospital and lab to
provide with on the job training (OJT) to its students, according to the Nursing
Council and CTEVT.

But, most of the nursing colleges here have been doing their business by showing
the only government hospital in Butwal for OJT to students.

More than half dozen nursing colleges of the region have obtained permission
letter from the Lumbini Hospital to conduct OJT and practical sessions of the
courses they are offering.

Among the technical institutions operating classes against the stipulated
standards and norms are Snajeevani Nursing College, Rambadevi Medical Sciences,
Mayadevi Technical College, Deurali Janata Technical Education Centre, Lumbini
Nursing College and Pratima Nima Health Science Bhairahawa. Published by HT

History of School of Mines

Can you please tell me something about the School of Mines? When and why was it
established? When and why was it closed down? Did it have any connection with
the mining industry? Was it connected in any way with the Adelaide Technical
High School? When and why was the ATHS established? When and why did that school
close? - D.H. (Rostrevor)

Adelaide Technical High School was created originally to improve the educational
standard of young men who planned to study at the School of Mines and Industries
and then work in the mining industry.

The school's courses began in 1898 with 27 students, followed by a second stage
in 1903 when the classes merged with the Agricultural School, thus forming the
Preparatory School of the South Australian School of Mines and Industries.

In 1918, the name was changed to Adelaide Technical High School.

The South Australian School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889 on
the corner of North Tce and Frome Rd, between the University of Adelaide and the
Royal Adelaide Hospital.

The SA School of Mines and Industries and Adelaide Technical High School
combined in 1960 to form the South Australian Institute of Technology, which
remains a part of the University of South Australia.

More beds at new RAH

Can you please tell me the number of beds at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and how
many beds are proposed at the new Royal Adelaide Hospital? - K.S. (Kadina)

The new Royal Adelaide Hospital will have 800 beds, most in single rooms, 40
technical suites and 23 theatres. The current Royal Adelaide Hospital has 680
beds.

Despite blood condition, he fights to get into Civil Services

BYLINE: Dipankar Ghose

LENGTH: 509  words

DATELINE: New Delhi


At first sight, 26-year-old Sukhsohit Singh looks like just another student with
a success story behind him. He topped the commerce stream among Kendriya
Vidyalayas in the Chandigarh region in 2002, and later attained the first
position in Masters in Public Administration at Panjab University. Then, after
studying for 15 hours a day, he achieved the 883rd rank in the UPSC
examinations.

However, what really sets Singh apart from the rest is the fact that he managed
all this while battling thalassemia major, a disease that requires him to get a
blood transfusion once in three weeks.

But what should have been an inspirational tale was cut short when Singh was
declared "medically unfit for all services" by Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital.
Recalling the day his dreams were rudely shattered, he said, "I was called on
February 9, 2011, for a medical check up at the hospital. They gave me a report,
which said I am unfit for all services. It is unconstitutional."

Singh filed an appeal with the department of Personnel and Training challenging
the verdict, after which he was called for a second medical test at the Ram
Manohar Lohia Hospital. "But I am not very hopeful of things working out. The
RML authorities said they were bound by the Government of India Gazette, and so
I don't know if anything different will happen now."

The results of the second medical test are still awaited.

Singh argues that the Government of India Gazette makes a clear distinction
between 'technical' and 'non-technical services'. Non-technical services are of
the kind that do not require physical exertion. For non-technical services, the
Government of India Gazette, Appendix III, says, "To be fit for appointment, a
candidate must be in good mental and bodily health, with no condition that is
likely to interfere with efficient performance."

"I had chosen non-technical services such as the Indian Defence Accounts Service
and the Indian Railway Accounts Service. I am fit for them," Singh said. To back
his claim, Singh had taken with him to Safdarjung Hospital a report from Dr R K
Marwaha, senior oncologist, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and
Research, Chandigarh, declaring him fit for service.

Dr Deepak Chopra, president, Thalassemics India, said, "Thalassemia patients
live absolutely normal lives as long as they get blood transfusions once in
three weeks. The decision to debar him from all services is unfair and will
prove to be a deterrent for other patients like him. The government must realise
what these children go through, and in that light, review this completely unjust
decision."

However, the boy has not lost hope yet. Such is Singh's determination to get
into the Civil Services that he gave the entrance again this year in order to
achieve a higher ranking. "Even though I achieved what I did by working through
all these problems, I still have to run from pillar to post to achieve my
dream," Singh said.

Singh, who is doing his PhD, also has an offer from the University of Kent to
pursue a Masters degree in International Relations.

Earl L. Matthews (1928-2015): Area teacher an executive at hospital in Williams
Co.

BYLINE: Mark Zaborney, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 562 words


June 06--PEMBERVILLE -- Earl L. Matthews, who traversed northwest Ohio in his
career as a teacher and professor, then as a high school, college, university,
and hospital administrator, died Wednesday in his Pemberville home. He was 87.

He had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, his daughter Cindy Landwehr said.

Mr. Matthews and his wife, Bessie, returned to Pemberville four years ago after
an absence of more than 30 years. They lived in Bryan at his 1986 retirement
from what was then Williams County General Hospital, where he was an executive.
He had retired in 1983 as vice president for educational services at Northwest
Technical College near Archbold and was recruited by the hospital's president,
whom he knew.

"He was always learning," his daughter said. "He started out as a coal miner's
son in West Virginia and put himself through school and got a PhD at age 50. He
was proud of that -- and humble."

Mr. Matthews had already begun his hospital job when the technical division of
the Ohio Vocational Association named him vocational educator of the year in
1983.

A longtime math and science teacher, Mr. Matthews led adult and continuing
education courses through much of the 1970s at the University of Toledo, where
in 1969 he was named to direct a referral network made up of industries in 13
counties. Before that, he was a vice president of administration at what was
then called Penta County Technical College. He also taught adult students how to
teach others their trade -- and social skills.

"He was teaching car mechanics how to teach car mechanics," his daughter Cindy
Landwehr said. "He really tried to not only teach academics. It wasn't a lecture
style, but getting people involved."

Mr. Matthews started out teaching math and science at his alma mater, Grover
Hill High School in Paulding County. He later taught those subjects at Eastwood
High School.

He was born March 7, 1928, in Clarksburg, W.Va., to Clara and Edward Matthews.
He left home at age 15 to live with a half sister in Grover Hill, where he
graduated in 1946. A Navy veteran, he was an airplane mechanic stateside.

He received a bachelor's degree from Defiance College. Later, a fellowship in
nuclear studies at Oak Ridge National Laboratory led to a master's degree from
the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. He received his doctoral degree from
UT.

For much of their retirement, he and his wife divided their time between homes
in Palmetto, Fla., and on Lake Erie at Catawba Island. He had a joke or comment
-- or funny impromptu song -- for most occasions. He often began, "'Did you hear
the one about ...,' and he would just make the whole room laugh," daughter Sue
Brueggemeier said.

Surviving are his wife, Bessie, whom he married Dec. 18, 1948; son, Dr. Greg
Matthews; daughters, Sue Brueggemeier, Cindy Landwehr, and Jan Middaugh; eight
grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

Memorial services will begin at noon today in Bethlehem Lutheran Church,
Pemberville, where the family will greet friends after 10 a.m.

Arrangements are by the Marsh Funeral Home, Pemberville.

The family suggests tributes to Bethlehem Lutheran, where he was a member, or
Hospice of Northwest Ohio.

Hospital Merger Mystery
IRS Audits Move Forward With Series of TAMs

                          January 17, 2001, Wednesday

By Ola Kinnander

DATELINE: PHOENIX



The Internal Revenue Service took another step forward in its audits of bonds
related to hospital mergers last week when the agency's municipal bond
enforcement group asked the Chief Counsel's Office to resolve some technical
questions.

The announcement that the first of a handful of technical advice memorandums has
been requested on the controversial hospital acquisition issue was made late
Friday by Sunita Lough, senior tax law specialist at the IRS, at the ABA
Tax-Exempt Financing Committee's winter meeting here. Lough also said at the
meeting that the enforcement group "soon" will request advice from the national
office on how payments made by private corporations for naming rights may affect
bonds sold to finance a stadium.

Furthermore, John Cross, a partner at Hawkins, Delafield & Wood, said at the
meeting that he has launched a project to develop ideas how existing laws and
regulations can be changed to simplify the tax code's section on tax-exempt
bonds.

But it was the hospital merger issue that took up the bigger part of the
meeting. Lough said the "seven or eight" audits pending in this area have some
overlapping issues that must be resolved but also have enough differences so
that several TAMs will be requested. She said a total of "three or four"
requests for technical advice eventually will be made.

One of the TAMs, for instance, is expected to focus on MedStar Health of
Columbia, Md. The hospital system said last August it had received a letter from
Charles Anderson, the IRS' manager of tax-exempt bond field operations, stating
it would be "prudent" for the IRS to ask for technical advice before potentially
concluding that the $300 million of bonds sold in 1998 to facilitate the merger
of Medlantic Health with Helix Health are taxable.

"Now we feel it's in the hands of those who can make a determination," John
Marzano, MedStar's spokesman, said yesterday.

In all the pending cases, the IRS is examining whether bonds issued to finance a
merger should be classified as an advance refunding, rather than remaining an
outstanding issue. If the bonds are determined by the IRS to be a refunding,
they could be deemed taxable, since some of the debt has already been advance
refunded prior to the merger.

To reach a conclusion, the IRS first must answer several underlying questions.
Lough said they include: Can a 501(c)(3) membership be acquired with tax-exempt
bond proceeds? What is the value of the membership interest? Who owns the
membership interest in a 501(c)(3)? And, when a 501(c)(3) acquires a membership
interest in another tax-exempt organization, does it automatically acquire the
underlying assets?

"These are very technical questions, and when we get the answers we can probably
apply them to the facts and circumstances of other cases," Lough said.

She also said the IRS' enforcement group, led by Mark Scott, is close to
requesting a field- service advice on stadium naming rights. Some IRS officials
are interested whether the increasingly large big amounts paid by private
corporations to have a stadium named after them may trigger private business use
that violates tax law. Many bond lawyers are fervently arguing that such
payments should not pose a problem, arguing that a naming right is an intangible
asset that does not represent private business use of a physical bond-financed
asset.

On a separate matter, Lough also said the number of tax-exempt bond field agents
has recently decreased to 41 from 43 after one retired and one resigned.

Cross also announced at the meeting that he is developing a "tax simplification"
project, with assistance from other bond lawyers. Areas of tax law that he may
advocate changing include relaxing the rules for small IDB private-activity
bonds. For instance, one proposal may propose broadening the definition of
manufacturing to include industrial facilities, he said. Also, he might push for
some relaxation of the arbitrage rules, such as simplifying the two-year
spend-down exception, as well as eliminating the alternative minimum tax
preference for tax-exempt bonds.

Cross told The Bond Buyer he would like to reach out to groups such as the
National Association of Counties and the Government Finance Officers Association
for help in lobbying the IRS and Congress on these issues.

Washington: Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:
 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality Agency Information Collection Activities: Proposed Collection; Comment
Request AGENCY: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, HHS. ACTION: Notice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY:
This notice announces the intention of the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve
the proposed information collection project: ``The AHRQ Safety Program for
Improving Surgical Care and Recovery.'' This proposed information collection was
previously published in the Federal Register titled ``The AHRQ Safety Program
for Enhancing Surgical Care and Recovery,'' on May 18, 2017 and allowed 60 days
for public comment. AHRQ did not receive any substantive comments.

The purpose of this notice is to allow an additional 30 days for public comment.
DATES: Comments on this notice must be received by August 28, 2017. ADDRESSES:
Written comments should be submitted to: AHRQ's OMB Desk Officer by fax at (202)
395-6974 (attention: AHRQ's desk officer) or by email at
OIRA_submission@omb.eop.gov (attention: AHRQ's desk officer). FOR FURTHER
INFORMATION CONTACT: Doris Lefkowitz, AHRQ Reports Clearance Officer, (301)
427-1477, or by email at doris.lefkowitz@AHRQ.hhs.gov SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Proposed Project In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-
3521, AHRQ invites the public to comment on this proposed information
collection. The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery is
a quality improvement project that aims to provide technical assistance to
hospitals to help them implement evidence-based practices to improve outcomes
and prevent complications among patients who undergo surgery. Enhanced recovery
pathways are a constellation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative
practices that decrease complications and accelerate recovery. A number of
studies and meta- analyses have demonstrated successful results. In order to
facilitate broader adoption of these evidence-based practices among U.S.
hospitals, this AHRQ project will adapt the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety
Program (CUSP), which has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to
reducing other patient harms, to enhanced recovery of surgical patients. The
approach uses a combination of clinical and cultural (i.e., technical and
adaptive) intervention components which include promoting leadership and
frontline staff engagement, close teamwork among surgeons, anesthesia providers,
and nurses, as well as enhancing patient communication and engagement.
Interested hospitals will voluntarily participate. This project has the
following goals:  Improve outcomes of surgical patients by disseminating and
 supporting implementation of evidence-based enhanced recovery practices
 within the CUSP framework.
      Develop a bundle of technical and adaptive interventions
 and associated tools and educational materials to support
 implementation.
      Provide technical assistance and training to hospitals for
 implementing enhanced recovery practices.
      Assess the adoption, and evaluate the effectiveness of,
 the intervention among the participating hospitals.
     This project is being conducted by AHRQ through its contractor
 Johns Hopkins University; with subcontractors Westat, and the American
 College of Surgeons. The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical
 Care and Recovery is being undertaken pursuant to AHRQ's mission to
 enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health
 services, and access to such services, through the establishment of a
 broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of
 improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the
 prevention of diseases and other health conditions. 42 U.S.C. 299.
Method of Collection
    To achieve the goals of this project the following data collections
 will be implemented:
     (1) Safety Culture Survey. Hospitals will assess the impact of
 participation in the project on perioperative safety culture by having
 their staff members who will be part of the enhanced recovery program
 complete a survey adapted from the AHRQ Surveys on Patient Safety
 Culture (SOPS) at the beginning and end of the program. The hospital's
 enhanced recovery project team will receive their survey results and
 then debrief their staff on their safety culture and identify
 opportunities for further improvement. The national
[[Page 35209]]
project team will provide technical assistance for this effort.
 Participating hospitals will promote awareness of the survey among
 their staff, coordinate implementation of the survey, encourage and
 provide staff the time to complete the survey, and organize a local
 debrief of the reports of their hospital's results. The national
 project team will assist this effort by providing an electronic portal
 for hospital staff to anonymously complete the survey and by analyzing
 the data and sending a report to the hospital. Data will also be
 analyzed in aggregate across all participating hospitals to evaluate
 the impact of the overall quality improvement effort on measured safety
 culture.
     (2) Patient Experience Survey. Hospitals will also assess the
 impact of participation in the project on patients' experience with
 care. This will be done via administration of a patient experience
 survey to patients discharged after a qualifying surgery. Patients will
 receive a pre-implementation assessment of patient experience after a
 qualifying surgery and a post-implementation assessment of patient
 experience will be administered to patients who were treated the
 enhanced recovery program at participating hospitals. The survey will
 be administered by the national project team. Hospitals will provide
 patient contact information to the project team after execution of a
 data use agreement. This information will be provided to the national
 project team to send the survey to patients on behalf of the hospital.
 The national project team will provide a summative report to each
 hospital with the hospital's results to promote additional local
 quality improvement work. Data will also be analyzed in aggregate
 across all participating hospitals to evaluate the impact of the
 overall quality improvement effort on patient experience of care.
     (3) Readiness and Implementation Assessments: Semi-structured
 qualitative interviews. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be
 conducted with key stakeholders at participating hospitals (e.g.,
 project leads, physician project champions, etc.). These include a
 readiness assessment conducted after a hospital's enrollment in the
 project and an implementation assessment conducted after a period of
 implementation. The readiness assessment will help identify which, if
 any, technical components of the enhanced surgical care and recovery
 intervention already exist at the hospital, project management and
 resources, clinician engagement, leadership engagement and potential
 barriers and facilitators to implementation. The implementation
 assessment will evaluate what elements of the enhanced recovery
 practices have been adopted, resources invested, team participation,
 major barriers (e.g., medications, equipment, trained personnel), and
 leadership participation. These assessments will help identify training
 needs of hospitals and inform the national team's approach. In
 addition, the results will inform the national team's understanding of
 local adaptations of the intervention and the degree to which
 intervention fidelity impacts changes in outcomes.
     (4) Site visits. Semi-structured site visits will be conducted at a
 subset of participating hospitals. Findings will help inform the
 national project implementation strategy. Information from these visits
 will be critical in understanding if and how team and/or leadership
 issues may affect implementation of enhanced recovery practices,
 including how this may differ across surgical services. Interviews will
 help uncover and clarify misalignments in roles, needed time and
 resources, best practices, and potential enablers of and barriers to
 enhanced surgical care and recovery implementation. Site visits will be
 conducted at approximately 4 hospitals per year, and each will be 1 day
 long. The types of hospital personnel anticipated being involved in
 part or all of the site visit include senior leadership, perioperative
 leadership, and patient safety and quality staff. Participating
 hospitals will receive a structured debriefing and brief summary report
 at the end of the one-day visit.

Dec. 17--The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and
Services Administration announced that it expects to award a cooperative
agreement for the Frontier Community Health Integration Project's technical
assistance to 10 critical access hospitals in Montana, Nevada and North Dakota.

The estimated total program funding available was cited as $500,000.

This funding opportunity is open to public, private and nonprofit organizations;
faith-based and community-based organizations; and tribes and tribal
organizations.

The agency description of the grant states: Technical assistance to the critical
access hospitals must include support for implementing one or any combination of
three specific health care interventions:

-- the waiver of the 35-mile rule for ambulance services, allowing cost-based
reimbursement for ambulance services regardless of nearby providers;

-- the waiver of the fixed $25 originating site fee for telehealth services,
instead allowing cost-based reimbursement for 101 percent of cost for overhead,
salaries, fringe benefits and the depreciation value of the telehealth
equipment; and

-- the waiver of the 25-bed inpatient bed limit, allowing up to 10 additional
beds to be used for skilled nursing facility/nursing facility care.

Other technical assistance activities should include support for quality
measurement and performance improvement projects, strategic planning to improve
patients' access to services, and other tracking, analytic and administrative
tasks as appropriate for the individual needs of the participating critical
access hospitals.

The funding opportunity number is HRSA-17-001 (CFDA 93.155). It was posted on
Dec. 8 with an application closing date of March 13.

Then And Now: Same Place, A Different Time Some have fond memories but others
remember that staff at the baths did not suffer nervous swimmers gladly.

All the baths are big news just at the moment because of the restoration of the
famous spa and the delays which have taken place in its official opening.

Beau Street, apart from housing the baths, also contains the old Technical
School which was originally the United Hospital. With its north facing portico,
the main front by John Pinch the Elder bears some similarity to Wood's General
Hospital. The rather heavy looking attic storey was added in 1860.

If you have an old photograph for publication on this page, please send it with
as much written information as possible to Christopher Hansford at The Bath
Chronicle, Windsor House, Windsor Bridge, Bath BA2 3AU.

Don't worry about the modern photograph, we will take one to go with your
historic photograph.

7-cr health scam, CBI raids docs.

LENGTH: 547 words



HIGHLIGHT: Delhi


NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation zeroed in on a Rs 7-crore scam
relating to supply of sub-standard laproscopes to government hospitals on Monday
and raided 14 places across the country, including seven in Delhi.

This followed registration of a corruption case against seven public servants,
unknown officials of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and
representatives of a private Delhi-based pharmaceutical firm.

"We registered a corruption case late yesterday and the raids were conducted
throughout today," said CBI spokesperson G Mohanty.

"In Delhi, the residential and official premises of Dr Sudha Salhan, Dr Uma Goel
and Rahul Sehgal were searched and we recovered numerous incriminating
documents," said CBI spokesperson G Mohanty.

"Raids were also conducted in Noida, Faridabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore
and Goa," he added. The raided premises in the capital are located in Vasant
Kunj, Saraswati Vihar, New Friends Colony, Barakhamba Road and Okhla Phase II.

Salhan, a medical consultant and head of department of obstetrics and
gynaecology at Safdarjung Hospital, is the wife of the medical superintendent of
the hospital, Dr R L Salhan, while Goel is a former professor and head of
department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Lady Hardinge Medical College.

Sehgal is a director with Nestor Pharmaceuticals Limited. Other persons named in
the case are officials of Hindustan Latex Limited's Thiruvananthspuram branch,
including V S Bhatt, general manager (procurement), V A Sasidharan, company
secretary and deputy general manager (finance), G Sreekumar, manager
(procurement), Alex Abraham, assistant manager (accounts), and Abraham Mathew,
bio-medical engineer.

The CBI alleged that the accused had abused their official positions in awarding
a contract to Nestor Pharmaceuticals Limited for supply of 250 single and 100
double puncture laproscopes, worth Rs 7 crore, in 2001.

The equipment was procured by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfarefor use
in government hospitals across the country. An expert bid evaluation committee
had been formed to decide on the supplier.

"There were several irregularities and inconsistencies in the basis of the
evaluation and short-listing of the lowest responsive bidder for which the
bid-evaluation committee is accountable," Mohanty said.

"It was further alleged that the technical members were changed with a view to
favour the private firm and an unsatisfactory report of another technical expert
was suppressed," he added.

According to the CBI, though the actual technical evaluation reports were
submitted in February 2001, the decision was taken in the matter much earlier
(on December 5, 2000) by the bid evaluation committee.

Both Salhan and Goel had replaced technical experts on the team before the
decision was taken. The Hindustan Latex officials had allegedly favoured Delhi -
based Nestor Pharmaceuticals in bagging the contract, in connivance with some of
the technical experts in the committee.

"Nestor Pharmaceuticals was neither a manufacturer of laproscopes, nor had the
requisite experience. The bid conditions were changed subsequently.

Consequently though the supplied laparoscopes were of substandard quality, they
were accepted and utilised in different government hospitals," Mohanty
explained.

Six hospitals left without repair service

SECTION: CITY EDITION; HOME NEWS; REGIONAL NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 182 words


Six hospitals in the control of the North Eastern Health Board have been left
without an out-of-hours electrical and mechanical repair service, following an
industrial dispute, writes Tim O'Brien.

The hospitals at Monaghan, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee and Navan have been
told by members of the Technical, Electrical and Engineering Union that the
health board is unwilling to adhere to an agreement for cover signed last April.

In November the union told the board that service would be withdrawn unless
payments, which it insists amount to E150 for all six hospitals in total per
week, were met.

The union provided a deadline of December 20th for resolution of the service
which the union's regional secretary, Mr Arthur Hall, said was the same contract
worked by all other health boards.

He said that since the deadline had passed one intensive care unit monitor had
ceased to work, and staff in Monaghan Hospital were being drafted in to wash
dishes following the breakdown of the hospital's dishwashers. A spokesman for
the health board was not available yesterday.

Student dies in college stabbing

SECTION: News, Pg.9

LENGTH: 223 words



A COLLEGE student died and two other teenagers were seriously injured yesterday
in a stabbing incident in a busy suburb of north London.

Two of the victims staggered into Southgate police station just after 12.45pm,
and one immediately collapsed at the front desk.

The more seriously injured of the pair, an 18-year-old male student at nearby
Southgate Technical College, was airlifted to hospital but died soon afterwards.

The other, also male and thought to be in his late teens, was last night in a
serious condition in hospital.

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said that soon afterwards a third male of around the
same age was found within the grounds of Southgate Technical College, also
suffering suspected stab wounds.

He was also thought to be in a serious condition in hospital last night.

A male was arrested near the college in connection with the stabbings and was
last night in custody at a police station.

The principal of Southgate Technical College, which only began its academic year

Former Student Shot in D.C. High School Gym

LENGTH: 632 words


A former student at McKinley Technical High School in Northeast Washington was
shot yesterday while playing basketball in the school gymnasium, apparently by a
student with whom he had had an earlier dispute, police said.

Joseph Bailey, 23, was approached shortly after 1 p.m. inside the school at
Second and T streets by someone who pulled a gun, shot him once in the arm and
fled, according to 5th District police Cmdr. Reginald Smith.

The shooting occurred while several students, faculty members and a D.C. police
officer assigned to the school were in the gym. Smith said that Bailey had been
in an argument Monday night during a neighborhood basketball game with someone
who had vowed "to get him."

Police said Dujuan Hopkins, 18, a student at McKinley, was arrested last night
in the shooting after going to the 5th District police station. They said
Hopkins, of the unit block of Q Street NE, was charged with assault with the
intent to kill while armed and would be presented in Superior Court today.

Bailey was taken to Washington Hospital Center, where he was in stable
condition, hospital officials said.

Bailey visited the school often to do volunteer work and play basketball,
according to police. Yesterday, officials said, he had gone to the principal's
office to discuss a college scholarship.

"He's not a stranger to the school," Smith said. "He's a familiar face, and the
kids know him. The principal knows him." McKinley Principal James Campbell would
not comment about the shooting.

Smith said it was unclear how the assailant, who passed through a metal detector
when he arrived yesterday morning, smuggled the gun into the school.

Security guards at the school said four guards and one D.C. police officer
oversee the safety of 897 students there.

"We've told the company [MVM Security, a private contractor] a million times
that we need more security," said one guard, who asked not to be identified.
"There's nothing we can do. This building is too big just for four people."

Phil Agner, a spokesman for MVM Security in Washington, did not return telephone
calls seeking comment.

After yesterday's shooting, students and outsiders went into the school without
being questioned by guards or school officials and bypassed the unmanned metal
detector at the front entrance.

Ralph Neal, assistant superintendent for the District's high schools, said he
was surprised to learn that the metal detectors were not being used.

"It concerns me, and I will definitely call Mr. Campbell and find out why there
was no one there minding the metal detectors and if the metal detectors work,"
Neal said.

D.C. Council member Harry Thomas Sr. (D-Ward 5) visited McKinley after the
shooting. "I want to find out how a kid can get into the schools with a gun,"
said Thomas, who was attending school budget hearings when he heard about the
shooting.

It was the latest incident in a rash of violence that has plagued the school,
which is one of 16 proposed for closure to save money and eliminate excess
space.

In November, a radio reporter who had just interviewed two McKinley students was
beaten by several youths in front of the school. A day before, two female
students were stabbed in the school.

In October, a television cameraman was roughed up by teenagers as he videotaped
paramedics carrying a stabbing victim from the school to an ambulance.

Neal called the school violence unfortunate and said officials are working to
make schools safer.

"The staff of McKinley Tech is working hard to bring about some changes there,"
Neal said. "We have to be more aware of what is taking place around us, and we
have to encourage our young people to rather than settling disputes with
violence to settle disputes through mediation."

activities in Pakistan through implementation of the standard

protocols, they added.

They said it will also serve as a training and resource

centre to improve quality and safety of care in other tertiary

and secondary health care hospitals across the country.

They said that patient safety was a WHO strategy in which

member states were urged to develop national standards for

patient safety, making use of WHO technical guiding documents.

The added member states have been asked to formulate

national patient safety programmes in collaboration with the

Regional Office and the World Alliance for Patient Safety besides

establishing mechanisms to promote partnership between regional

patient safety institutions and national health care delivery

systems.

100 days on, KGMU VC plans yet to materialise

BYLINE: Yusra Husain

SECTION: TIMES CITY

LENGTH: 417 words


Vice chancellor of King George's Medical University Prof MLB Bhatt completed 100
days in office on Monday . After assuming charge, he had listed certain
decisions to improve functioning of the university and its hospitals within 100
days. However, in a reality check on Tuesday , TOI found that none of them has
materialised fully . TOI also spoke to the VC and chief medical superintendent
(CMS) Prof S N Shakhwar.

Pulling down wall between trauma centre, Shatabdi Hospital: Besides easing
movement of patients and doctors between the two buildings, bringing down the
wall would have cleared space and helped in rescue operations in the July 15
fire incident. \x93Oxygen plant is on the other side of the wall and pipeline
passes through it for supply to trauma centre and Shatabdi Hospital.The
contractor has been asked to bring down the wall but there are some technical
issues,\x93 said the VC.

Patient registration, pat

hology testing, etc to be revamped, put online: Overloaded and crumbling, KGMU's
in-house software was to be upgraded to reduce hospital load. \x93The software
is being upgraded and APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University is extending
technical support,\x93 said the VC.

Stretcher stand around new dental faculty building, between trauma centre, OPD:
Around 20 stretchers were to be provided with staff. \x93Keeping the stretcher
in open would expose them to rains so once a shed is built the stretchers will
be placed there,\x93 said the VC.

More manpower for neurosurgery, paediatrics wards of trauma centre: Both
departments were to

get three more nurses each.\x93New nurses are being recruited,\x93 said the CMS.

Retired army personnel as private security guards: Decision followed gangrape at
Shatabdi Hospital. \x93Around 18 posts have been sanctioned and there will be
new guards at trauma centre, Queen Mary hospital and Gandhi ward by next
week,\x93 said the CMS.

Guidance system for patients from far-off regions: Work has yet to begin in this
direction and patients continue to face problems on the KGMU campus. \x93There
are some points for guidance of patients but more have to be put up,\x93 said
the CMS.

One-point-system for free health services for BPL patients: It was one of the
first decisions. Administration claimed a central office is available for
patients but attendants of patients still run from faculty-in-charge to
unit-in-charge and to the PRO to avail of the benefit.\x93This happens mostly at
trauma centre but system will be streamlined soon,\x93 said the CMS.

Poor patients at CMCH suffering

SECTION: Vol. 14 No. 278

LENGTH: 334  words


All development schemes at Chandka Medical College Hospital are in crisis due to
the non-availability of engineering wing at the largest teaching hospital of
Upper Sindh.

It has been learnt that two sanctioned posts of civil engineer and electrical
engineer are still vacant since long, which has complicated the situation.

No postings on the said positions have been made yet despite repeated letters by
the hospital administration.

In this connection, CMCH Medical Superintendent Dr. Javed Ali Shaikh wrote a
letter on Friday to Health Secretary informing him about this serious situation.

He stated that previously Executive Engineer, Provincial Building Division,
Larkana, was supervising the civil works and also providing technical sanction
of the new projects of ADP and M and R.

But he has refused to do so for one year due to which almost all development
works came to a standstill including the establishment of Faryal Talpur Cardiac
Surgery Complex, stated Dr Javed.

The center has facilities of coronary angiography, cardiac catheterized
laboratory, cardiac bypass surgery, and chest surgery.

"The matter was taken up at various forums but still to be resolved", the MS
wrote, adding that due to the non-availability of engineering wing serious
technical nature issues have emerged.

He stated that Director General (Design), Building Department, Government of
Sindh, is not authenticating the estimate of the hospital and technical sanction
of the estimates are not given by competent authorities which are must.

Dr. Javed requested to the Health Secretary to approach Communication and Works
Department Secretary either to depute an executive engineer/assistant engineer
at CMCH or to authorize XEN District Building Larkana and concerned
Superintending Engineer to extend technical support and supervise civil works.

Also, he added, direct DG (Design) and Chief Engineer Building to authenticate
estimates and give technical sanction respectively to CMCH schemes in the larger
interest of poor patients.

Gold Coast Hospital Improves Patient Care & Reduces Hospital Costs with Hospital
Intranet

LENGTH: 590  words


July 22 -- US based Intranet Connections issued the following news release:

Gold Coast Hospital Emergency Department, a member of the Queensland Health, was
given a commendation at the Intranet Innovation Awards for their award-winning
intranet from Intranet Connections named "EmergencyWeb".

The hospital's intranet journey began as most do when Leo Marneros, Director of
Emergency Medical Training at Gold Coast Hospital, decided to seek out an
intranet platform that would improve collaboration and increase communication
within the hospital. Since there would be over 350 users and two locations,
Marneros knew the hospital needed that would enable non-technical administrators
to add and manage content on the site to ensure the hospital intranet would be
collaborative and communication would flow smoothly.

After evaluating a number of intranet solutions, most relying heavily on IT to
administrate, Marneros found an intranet solution that would not only speak to
the non-technical users, but also deliver on the strong collaboration and
communication components: Intranet Connections.

Marneros summarizes the decision, saying: "Intranet Connections presented a
fully-functional, simple intranet solution that was quick to implement and made
it easy for non-technical users to contribute and manage from day one." Read
more from Marneros about the innovated ways Gold Coast Hospital utilizes their
hospital intranet in the EmergencyWeb Case Study.

Gold Coast Hospital Intranet's, EmergencyWeb, quickly became a success with
Marneros leading the way as the Intranet Champion. EmergencyWeb was quickly
adopted by hospital staff, yielding significant benefits to the hospital,
including:

* Reduced Hospital Costs with Online Credentialing

* Increased Staff Engagement moving Procedural Checklists Online

* Enhanced Staff Training with Multi-Media eLearning Online

* Improved Manual Procedures with Online Intern Assessments

* Eliminated Paper-Waste with Online Communication & Collaboration

The Emergency Department of Gold Coast Hospital continues to innovate with
Intranet Connections, finding new ways to utilize their hospital intranet for
daily tasks and procedures. This includes establishing a "Home Care Team"
through their intranet to improve patient care. The "Home Care Team" is an
intranet application that secures patient information in an online form for
those that require further care after leaving the Emergency Department. For
patients who fit specific treatment criteria, their information is entered,
secured and easily accessed by hospital staff that provide care at the hospital
or in the patients' homes after release. This innovative intranet application
helps keep all staff members that interact with the patient on the same page and
has made for a smoother transition back home, overall improving patient care.

By encouraging all employees to collaborate on EmergencyWeb, Gold Coast has
built several incredible intranet applications and has saved Gold Coast Hospital
thousands in time-cost savings. A simple audit of a single application, the
Intern Evaluation & Assessment application moved online from a paper-based
format, Marneros was able to calculate a total time-cost savings of $10,000 AUD
year-over-year.

Marneros discusses the measurable impact and ongoing innovation Intranet
Connections has had on Gold Coast Hospital saying: "EmergencyWeb allows for
amazing, innovative ways to deliver training. You are only limited by your
imagination on how you want to deliver the education."

Qatar Hospital's new robotic surgery machine non-funtional

SECTION: Vol. 15 No. 170

LENGTH: 228  words


Sindh Government Qatar Hospital Karachi's expansive robotic surgery machine is
lying non-functional for couple of years after developing a 'technical fault' as
despite various request by the hospital administration to Sindh Health
Department required funds could not be released for the maintenance of machine.

The advanced robotic surgery machine was installed in the hospital in 2011.
Around 70 successful surgeries were performed from 2011 to 2014 in the hospital
but later the surgeries through robotic machine could not be performed due to
some technical fault and management failure to get it repaired. However,
according to Medical Superintendent, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Orangi
Town, Dr Syed Khalid Masood robotic surgery machine could not be repaired due to
shortage of funds.

"Rs 40 million is urgently needed for repairing robotic machine and the hospital
administration had sent a request to Sindh health department for release of
funds to get this machine repaired," Dr Masood said.

The major advantages of robotic surgery are precision, miniaturization, smaller
incisions, decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. The cost
of per surgery on this machine is in millions at private hospitals but Qatar
Hospital was performing all surgeries free of cost before this new machine got
the 'mysterious technical fault', Dr Masood added.

LOUISE'S LOCKS LOPPED OFF FOR CHARITY

A COVENTRY librarian's assistant has lost her locks to raise funds for the
Walsgrave Hospital Kidney Patients' Association.

Louise Farnell-Dyson, aged 45, was inspired to support the charity because her
cousin, Peter Farnell, also aged 45, is due to have a kidney transplant next
week.

She was whisked out of the library at Coventry Technical College to become a
model for students in the hairdressing department.

Mrs Farnell-Dyson, who lives in Templar Avenue, Tile Hill, said: "Everyone was a
bit shocked about me having my head shaved and said I was very brave.

Four extra holes were drilled as part of the preliminary geo-technical work
around Goulburn Base Hospital on Tuesday afternoon.

Southern NSW Local Health District Project Leader Kerry Hort said the increase
from four to nine holes was not unusual.

"This is one of the many steps they have to do to make sure we have all the
right information for the building," Ms Hort said.

Soil samples were collected around the hospital building and car park area. The
process will allow architects to accurately plan for future construction through
analysing the materials in different locations.

"Everything is on track," she said.

These works are the first step in the master plan for the hospitals
redevelopment.

Expansion works are planned to start in the second half of next year.

Mural team adds color to Leominster hospital

BYLINE: Anna L. Griffin; STAFF REPORTER

SECTION: Pg. 11

LENGTH: 462 words

DATELINE: LEOMINSTER


Alyce Sneddon, a student at the Center for Technical Education, knows something
about being a kid and being in a hospital.

Miss Sneddon said she was a multiple-organ transplant recipient when she was
younger. "I've been in a lot of hospitals. They're not pretty."

She said she spent a lot of time thinking about "things" while in one hospital
or the other. She said she often thought that if she was well enough, she would
like to do something to help young children.

"You do a lot of thinking when you're in the hospital," she said. "This seemed
like it was the perfect thing to do."

It was her personal history that led Miss Sneddon to pose the idea of forming a
team to paint murals at the local hospital to CTE graphic arts teacher Jean
Mitchell as a Youth Venture project.

"I really liked the idea," said Ms. Mitchell. "It's one of those ideas that just
pops out at you."

According to information from the organization, Youth Venture is a national
nonprofit organization founded in 1997 and based in Arlington, Va. It strives to
help young people work toward improving not only their own lives but also their
school and their community, by challenging them to create a business or
organization that will have an effect on the community. Those creating ventures
receive, in return, funding and technical assistance for their projects.

The national program was brought to the area by the United Way of North Central
Massachusetts. There are currently Youth Venture programs operating in the
Leominster and Shirley public school systems.

The students, along with teacher Jean Mitchell posed the Community Outreach
Mural Project (COMP) as a Youth Venture program. Their idea was accepted and
this past April, the 11 students working on the COMP team - along with help from
artist Sam Evangelis - started to work painting the murals in the pediatric ward
- both hallways and patient rooms - at the Leominster campus of HealthAlliance
Hospitals.

Ms. Mitchell said the paintings have been very well-received by the hospital
staff, who have invited the young people to come back and paint some more.

"The staff realizes what a positive effect this has on the children," Ms.
Mitchell said. "The comments we were getting were unbelievable. It was very
encouraging."

And the project made giving up vacation time worth it. "Everyone on the team
felt the same way," Miss Sneddon said. The students also recruited the children
on the unit to help with the murals; some of those children were working while
using wheelchairs and crutches.

Participating in a mural project at UMass Memorial - HealthAlliance Leominster
Campus are - standing, from left - Etta Lania and Tania Arseneau; front, Alyce
Sneddon, Kate Lynn Sanchez and Jean Mitchell.

Qatar Hospital's new robotic surgery machine non-funtional

LENGTH: 265  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


KARACHI, June 19 -- Sindh Government Qatar Hospital Karachi's expansive robotic
surgery machine is lying non-functional for couple of years after developing a '
technical fault' as despite various request by the hospital administration to
Sindh Health Department required funds could not be released for the maintenance
of machine.

The advanced robotic surgery machine was installed in the hospital in 2011.
Around 70 successful surgeries were performed from 2011 to 2014 in the hospital
but later the surgeries through robotic machine could not be performed due to
some technical fault and management failure to get it repaired. However,
according to Medical Superintendent, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Orangi
Town, Dr Syed Khalid Masood robotic surgery machine could not be repaired due to
shortage of funds.

"Rs 40 million is urgently needed for repairing robotic machine and the hospital
administration had sent a request to Sindh health department for release of
funds to get this machine repaired," Dr Masood said.

The major advantages of robotic surgery are precision, miniaturization, smaller
incisions, decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. The cost
of per surgery on this machine is in millions at private hospitals but Qatar
Hospital was performing all surgeries free of cost before this new machine got
the 'mysterious technical fault', Dr Masood added.

Cidco invites tenders for setting up three hospitals through PPP

BYLINE: dna correspondent

LENGTH: 390  words


Belapur: In accordance with its proposal to set up three super speciality
hospitals in Kharghar, New Panvel and Ulwe, City and Industrial Development
Corporation (Cidco) has invited tenders from interested parties to undertake
development, operation and management of these hospitals under a long-term lease
agreement structured on public-private partnership principles.

The town planning body intends to select a private developer-cum-operator for
the hospitals through two bids - technical and financial.

According to a senior Cidco official, the hospitals will come up at sector 3 in
New Panvel (opposite NMMT bus depot), sector 23 in Ulwe, and sector 18 in
Kharghar.

"While the New Panvel facility will come up on an area spanning 10,000 sq metre,
the ones in Ulwe and Kharghar will come up on plots measuring 3,600 and 4,000 sq
metres, respectively," the official said.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) document containing details of the scope of
projects, eligibility criteria, bid evaluation process, draft project agreements
and detail tender programme can be downloaded from Cidco's website -
www.cidco.maharashtra.gov.in.

It can also be purchased from the office of chief health officer, seventh floor,
Cidco Bhavan, Belapur, upon the payment of Rs50,000, payable in the form of
Demand Draft  in favour of 'Cidco Limited' on all working days till November 28.

The pre-bid meeting will be held on December 3, between 2.30pm and 5.30pm while
technical bids should be submitted by December 16 between 11am and 1pm.

The opening of technical bids will be on December 17 between 3pm and 5pm while
bidders will be informed about the technical eligibility by December 23. The
date of submission of financial bids by technically eligible and willing bidders
is December 30

The official added that the purpose behind setting up these hospitals is to
provide the best healthcare to residents at affordable rates.

"There are quite a few private hospitals in Cidco-administered areas but many
residents are unable to benefit from the facilities due to high charges. To
facilitate the same, we decided to construct these hospitals so that people can
receive medical facilities at cheaper rates," the official said.

He added that while the hospital at New Panvel will have 200 beds, the ones at
Kharghar at Ulwe nodes will have 80 and 70 beds, respectively.

LCQ3: New acute general hospital in Kai Tak Development Area

LENGTH: 1056  words


Hong Kong, Feb. 12 -- Hong Kong SAR Government issued the following news
release:

Following is a question by the Hon Wong Kwok-kin and a written reply by the
Secretary for Food and Health, Dr Ko Wing-man, in the Legislative Council today
(February 12):

Question:

The Government proposed in this year's Policy Address to conduct strategic
planning to prepare for the building of a new acute hospital (the new hospital)
at Kai Tak Development Area.  It has been reported that the authorities intend
to raise the plot ratio of the new hospital site so as to increase the number of
beds and to relocate all the existing healthcare services of Queen Elizabeth
Hospital (QEH) to the new hospital.  In this connection, will the Government
inform this Council:

(1) whether the strategic planning will include conducting studies and public
consultations on issues relating to relocation of the healthcare services of
QEH; if so, of the details as well as the relevant initial ideas, timetable and
estimated expenditure; when the new hospital is expected to be completed and
commissioned;

(2) of the number of beds to be provided by the new hospital, and whether that
figure is calculated on the basis of an increased plot ratio; if so, of the
details; how the number of beds in the new hospital compares with the current
number of beds provided by QEH, and whether the former will be sufficient to
meet the additional demand for healthcare services arising from future
population growth in the nearby areas;

(3) of the area of the new hospital site; whether the authorities have assessed
if the site has sufficient space for future expansion; if they have assessed, of
the results; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the land use of the site currently occupied by QEH after relocation of
its healthcare services to the new hospital, and whether the site will continue
to be used for providing public healthcare services; whether the authorities
have assessed the impact of QEH ceasing to provide healthcare services at its
existing site on the demand for services of Kwong Wah Hospital, the other acute
hospital nearby; if they have assessed, of the results; if not, the reasons for
that?

Reply:

President,

To meet the healthcare service demand of the Kowloon region in the long run, we
have reserved a site in the Kai Tak Development (KTD) Area for the construction
of a new acute general hospital.  The proposed hospital will provide clinical
services of major specialties, including accident and emergency services.  The
Hospital Authority (HA) is conducting the relevant strategic planning and
studies to gauge the service needs of Kowloon and the Kai Tak area. Technical
assessment and analysis of clinical needs are also being carried out so that the
provision of medical services can suitably cope with the long-term development
of the area.  The service planning and technical feasibility study for the new
hospital are expected to be completed this year.  We will then seek funding
approval in accordance with the established procedures so as to implement the
project as soon as possible.

My reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The HA is reviewing and assessing the overall demand for and supply of
healthcare services in Kowloon, as well as developing the clinical services plan
of the Kowloon Central Cluster (KCC).  The review and the services plan are
expected to be completed within this year.  The key aspects of the services plan
include formulating proposals for the healthcare services to be provided by the
acute general hospital in the KTD Area and mapping out the future development
directions of the existing hospitals in the KCC.   Upon completion of the
planning work, the HA will work out the timetable and estimated expenditure
involved in the development of the new hospital.

(2) At present, Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) provides a total of 1 844 beds.
The HA is developing the clinical services plan for the KCC, setting out its
future development direction as well as the service capacity of and the number
of beds to be provided by the new acute general hospital in the KTD Area.  Upon
completion of the clinical services plan, the HA will start the planning for the
construction of the new hospital and conduct relevant technical feasibility
studies.

In making demand projection and defining the scale of the new acute general
hospital in Kai Tak (including the number of beds), we will take into account
the population in the KTD Area and other factors such as the pace of population
growth and ageing in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City and the neighbourhood areas,
cross-district utilisation of medical services, as well as the roles of various
hospitals in the district and the co-ordination of their services and
facilities. This is to ensure that the provision of medical services in the
district can suitably address the overall long-term service demand.

(3) We have reserved about seven hectares of land in the KTD Area for the
development of healthcare facilities, including the Centre of Excellence in
Paediatrics under construction and the proposed acute general hospital.  As
mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the HA is conducting strategic planning
and studies for the development of the acute general hospital in the KTD.
Subject to technical feasibility, the HA will consider development options and
the need for further expansion of the new hospital having regard to the
long-term demand for medical services.

(4) The clinical services plan of the KCC and the technical feasibility study
for the new hospital is expected to be completed in 2014.  During the planning
process, the needs of local residents will be considered, the development of
hospitals in the cluster (including QEH) and their co-ordination with other
hospitals will also be worked out according to the demand projection.

The redevelopment of the QEH is still in the preliminary planning/conceptual
stage and the Administration has yet to finalise a plan.  Nevertheless, with an
increasing demand for overall healthcare services in Hong Kong, there is a need
to provide more healthcare facilities.  Hence, we do not have plan to change the
use of the current QEH site from provision of public healthcare services to
other purposes.

Saints Medical bond rating takes a hit from Moody's

BYLINE: By Chris Camire, ccamire@lowellsun.com

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 566 words


LOWELL -- Saints Medical Center's bond rating was downgraded by Moody's
Investors Services this week due to its high debt load, multiyear operating
losses and dwindling cash supply.

The hospital has $51 million of outstanding bonds issued by the Massachusetts
Health & Educational Facilities Authority. The hospital's cash on hand fell to
44 days.

Moody's downgraded the hospital's credit rating to "Ba3" from "Ba2." The
hospital is highly leveraged with its cash-to-debt ratio declining to 42.4
percent with debt-to-cash flow rising to an unfavorable level of about 16 times,
said Moody's

Meanwhile, Saints is negotiating with the federal government over a civil fine
for apparently violating a doctor-referral law that could see the hospital pay a
penalty as low as $785,000 or as high as $14.5 million.

The hospital released a statement expressing disappointment that a change
occurred in the long-term rating of its bonds. The rating will not have any
immediate impact on day-to-day hospital operations, according to Saints.

"The financial data on which Moody's decision is based, and which is included in
the Moody's opinion, is not new information beyond what was reported in May in
conjunction with the release of Saints' audited financial statements," said the
hospital.

Stephen Guimond, Saints' interim CEO, and Gary Campbell, chairman of the board
of trustees, have emphasized that the civil fines the hospital may face involve
"no fraud, no abuse" but technical violations of the federal Stark Law.

The 1989 law adopted to ferret out fraud and abuse in the Medicare system
prohibits a doctor from making referrals to a health-care provider for certain
health services that are reimbursable by Medicare if that doctor has a
"financial relationship" with the health-care provider.

Saints has not been accused of wrongdoing but has -- on its own -- admitted to "
technical omissions" and "technical compliance violations" on contracts between
doctors and the hospital. The hospital said it is working with political leaders
and its legal counsel to resolve these technical compliance issues, which date
back decades.

Moody's three-page report does contain bright spots for the hospital. It notes
that Saints is pursuing a strategy to capture a larger share of the
out-migration market that currently goes to regional community hospitals.

To build referrals for this market, Saints has expanded its employed physician
base, concentrating on placing primary-care physicians in offices in areas where
it seeks to grow market share. The employed physician group has grown to 36 from
only four in 2005 and includes 14 primary-care physicians, according to Moody's.

"As always, we remain committed to providing the highest quality community
hospital care in a compassionate Catholic setting," said the hospital.

Saints is in a very competitive market with Lowell General Hospital, which
offers a similar services, according to the Moody's report. Most specialists
admit patients to both hospitals, but in recent years several physicians in
different specialties, including obstetrics, were recruited away from Saints by
Lowell General.

The report states that strategic capital spending is vital for Saints' ability
to compete with Lowell General, which is a larger hospital with more services,
having 214 beds to Saints' 108 beds. Lowell General captures 32.5 percent of the
market share to Saints' 22.2 percent.

CLUBBED TO DEATH IN AN ALLEY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 307 words


GARDAI launched a murder investigation last night following the discovery of a
man's body in an alleyway.

Michael Shannon, 34, of Connolly Villas, Ennis, was found unconscious with
serious head injuries at Lysaght's Lane, in the town's market area, at 4.10pm
yesterday.

He was taken to Ennis General Hospital but died shortly afterwards.

A hospital spokesman said Gardai were investigating reports of an assault said
to have taken place in Lysaght's Lane.

Last night the scene was being preserved by forensic scientists to allow an
examination by a team from the Garda Technical Bureau.

A post mortem is to be performed by Assistant State Pathologist Dr Maire Cassidy
at Ennis General Hospital today.

The victim, who is known to Gardai, had served several prison sentences
including one for his part in an attack on an elderly man in Ennis in the early

Premier steps in to fix health collapse

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 282 words


DAMNING media reports - including patients eating rotten and infested food at
Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital and others dying at Steve Biko Academic
Hospital because of non-functioning machines - have prompted the government to
act.

Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane placed her own provincial health department
under administration yesterday, hoping that a technical task team will resolve
the ills of all Gauteng's health facilities.

However, the announcement does not affect the position of the MEC for Health,
Hope Papo, who would still remain the department's political boss. The
administrator and technical team would report to him.

Mokonyane explained that the administration would be different to the Limpopo
Health Department's situation, as there was no national government intervention
in Gauteng.

The premier said she was expecting the administrator to set up a technical team
that would focus on bringing changes to health logistics, hospital management,
human resources, financial management and communications.

She emphasised that the administrator and technical team would cease to exist
once the department's problems were over. She also emphasised that this team
would work with the acting head of department Ndoda Biyela until a new head had
been appointed.

The premier and the MEC for Finance, Mandla Nkomfe, promised to settle the
health department's outstanding debt of R883 000 by December 21.

Papo also vowed to crack the whip on staff members who are fraudulently claiming
overtime payments.

The department has also promised to improve its supply chain management, and it
accused some of its suppliers of overpricing their goods.

The DA welcomed Mokonyane's announcement.

Information Services Department: LCQ3: New Acute General Hospital in Kai Tak
Development Area

LENGTH: 1032  words


Hong Kong, Feb. 12 -- Following is a question by the Hon Wong Kwok-kin and a
written reply by the Secretary for Food and Health, Dr Ko Wing-man, in the
Legislative Council today (February 12):



Question:

The Government proposed in this year's Policy Address to conduct strategic
planning to prepare for the building of a new acute hospital (the new hospital)
at Kai Tak Development Area.  It has been reported that the authorities intend
to raise the plot ratio of the new hospital site so as to increase the number of
beds and to relocate all the existing healthcare services of Queen Elizabeth
Hospital (QEH) to the new hospital.  In this connection, will the Government
inform this Council:

(1) whether the strategic planning will include conducting studies and public
consultations on issues relating to relocation of the healthcare services of
QEH; if so, of the details as well as the relevant initial ideas, timetable and
estimated expenditure; when the new hospital is expected to be completed and
commissioned;

(2) of the number of beds to be provided by the new hospital, and whether that
figure is calculated on the basis of an increased plot ratio; if so, of the
details; how the number of beds in the new hospital compares with the current
number of beds provided by QEH, and whether the former will be sufficient to
meet the additional demand for healthcare services arising from future
population growth in the nearby areas;

(3) of the area of the new hospital site; whether the authorities have assessed
if the site has sufficient space for future expansion; if they have assessed, of
the results; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the land use of the site currently occupied by QEH after relocation of
its healthcare services to the new hospital, and whether the site will continue
to be used for providing public healthcare services; whether the authorities
have assessed the impact of QEH ceasing to provide healthcare services at its
existing site on the demand for services of Kwong Wah Hospital, the other acute
hospital nearby; if they have assessed, of the results; if not, the reasons for
that?

Reply:

President,

To meet the healthcare service demand of the Kowloon region in the long run, we
have reserved a site in the Kai Tak Development (KTD) Area for the construction
of a new acute general hospital.  The proposed hospital will provide clinical
services of major specialties, including accident and emergency services.  The
Hospital Authority (HA) is conducting the relevant strategic planning and
studies to gauge the service needs of Kowloon and the Kai Tak area. Technical
assessment and analysis of clinical needs are also being carried out so that the
provision of medical services can suitably cope with the long-term development
of the area.  The service planning and technical feasibility study for the new
hospital are expected to be completed this year.  We will then seek funding
approval in accordance with the established procedures so as to implement the
project as soon as possible.

My reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The HA is reviewing and assessing the overall demand for and supply of
healthcare services in Kowloon, as well as developing the clinical services plan
of the Kowloon Central Cluster (KCC).  The review and the services plan are
expected to be completed within this year.  The key aspects of the services plan
include formulating proposals for the healthcare services to be provided by the
acute general hospital in the KTD Area and mapping out the future development
directions of the existing hospitals in the KCC.   Upon completion of the
planning work, the HA will work out the timetable and estimated expenditure
involved in the development of the new hospital.

(2) At present, Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) provides a total of 1 844 beds.
The HA is developing the clinical services plan for the KCC, setting out its
future development direction as well as the service capacity of and the number
of beds to be provided by the new acute general hospital in the KTD Area.  Upon
completion of the clinical services plan, the HA will start the planning for the
construction of the new hospital and conduct relevant technical feasibility
studies.

In making demand projection and defining the scale of the new acute general
hospital in Kai Tak (including the number of beds), we will take into account
the population in the KTD Area and other factors such as the pace of population
growth and ageing in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City and the neighbourhood areas,
cross-district utilisation of medical services, as well as the roles of various
hospitals in the district and the co-ordination of their services and
facilities. This is to ensure that the provision of medical services in the
district can suitably address the overall long-term service demand.

(3) We have reserved about seven hectares of land in the KTD Area for the
development of healthcare facilities, including the Centre of Excellence in
Paediatrics under construction and the proposed acute general hospital.  As
mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the HA is conducting strategic planning
and studies for the development of the acute general hospital in the KTD.
Subject to technical feasibility, the HA will consider development options and
the need for further expansion of the new hospital having regard to the
long-term demand for medical services.

(4) The clinical services plan of the KCC and the technical feasibility study
for the new hospital is expected to be completed in 2014.  During the planning
process, the needs of local residents will be considered, the development of
hospitals in the cluster (including QEH) and their co-ordination with other
hospitals will also be worked out according to the demand projection.

The redevelopment of the QEH is still in the preliminary planning/conceptual
stage and the Administration has yet to finalise a plan.  Nevertheless, with an
increasing demand for overall healthcare services in Hong Kong, there is a need
to provide more healthcare facilities.  Hence, we do not have plan to change the
use of the current QEH site from provision of public healthcare services to
other purposes.

The petro dealers association must accept the findings and recommendations of a
competent government authority

It is frustrating to hear that the petro dealers association has warned that it
will continue its protest and will not collect petroleum products from Nepal Oil
Corporation depots if it does not find government report on "technical loss" of
the petroleum products convincing. The Nepal Bureau of Standard and Metrology
has been assigned to look into the claim of the Bagmati Petroleum Dealers'
Association that a dealer has to incur loss of 99 litres while purchasing per
4,000 litres of petroleum products from NOC depots. The petroleum dealers are
demanding the loss commission from the state-owned fuel monopoly. The
association has submitted a memorandum to the government seeking a hike in loss
commission while ferrying the petroleum products from various NOC depots. The
association distributes fuels to as many as 300 petrol stations across the
country. Following the demand of the petro dealers association, the NOC has
formed a committee under the coordination of Director General of Nepal Bureau of
Standard and Metrology (NBSM), Bishwo Babu Pudasaini, to find out the actual
technical loss of fuel incurred by the dealers. The committee is all set to
submit its report within a week.

The probe committee has found that the petro dealers have "highly inflated" the
claim of technical loss during transportation of the petroleum products. Such a
claim could widen the dispute between the NOC and the petro dealers who have
already warned that they would stop collecting the petroleum products if the
government report is inconsistent with their claim. They have also threatened to
halt the purchase of the petroleum products unless their demand is met. As of
now, the NOC has been allowing deduction of 35 litres of petrol and 26 litres of
diesel on every 4,000 litres of fuels purchased by the dealers from NOC depots.
On the other hand, the NOC has already stated that it would adjust the technical
loss commission for the dealers as per the recommendation of the NBSM report.

The petro dealers association has given the NOC an ultimatum until July 17 to
increase the technical loss commission of fuel from a range of 66 litres to 99
litres on every 4,000 litres of the fuel. The NBSM had studied the fuel supply
data from mid-April to mid-May to determine the actual loss of fuel incurred by
the dealers. During the course of the study, the committee found that the
dealers had been receiving lesser amount of fuel than filled in the NOC depots.
This was mainly because of faulty calibration of oil tankers, and fluctuations
of temperature also affected the supply amount. And, such technical loss
generally takes pace during the summer. In order to determine the actual
technical loss of fuel at the time of transportation NBSM has stressed on
conducting a study throughout the year. However, what can be said is that the
petro dealers association must accept the findings and recommendations of a
competent government authority. The petro dealers deserve due compensation for
the loss of fuel from the NOC depots to the petrol pumps. But they have no right
to squeeze the NOC to increase the amount of loss commission putting the fuel
supply at risk.

Get service back

It is not the first time that any unit in a government hospital, and in the
present case, the country's oldest and premier hospital has closed its services
for lack of resources. Unfortunately, it may not be the last time. Bir Hospital
has closed its surgical treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other related
services on the grounds that it lacks the budget to buy modern technology to
conduct surgery, to set up adequate infrastructure and to hire enough personnel.
Instead, the unit has started referring its cardiovascular patients to Shahid
Gangalal National Heart Centre, which is also run with taxpayers' money.

The way they have been running the state-run hospitals do not provide high hopes
that things will change for the better from now on. The Gangalal hospital is
already under heavy pressure of patients, as heart disease continues to increase
and it has become a referral hospital for heart disease from around the country.
The authorities concerned should immediately act to get the services back on
track by resolving these problems. It should also be examined whether Bir
Hospital is being run efficiently and effectively, otherwise any money poured
into it might be like water poured on a mound of sand.

Construction worker John Williams has retired after a career spanning half a
century.  Mr Williams, of Easton-in-Gordano, started work as an apprentice
plasterer in 1954.

He followed in his father Harold's footsteps when he began to learn his trade at
Bristol Technical School at the age of 13 and started work at 16 before managing
projects including Bristol's dental hospital, eye hospital and the maternity
hospital. He also worked on the Bath Magistrates Court, the Parish Wharf Sports
Centre in Portishead and the Rehabilitation Unit at the Weston General Hospital
as well as spending time abroad, building essential infrastructure in
middle-Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iraq.

He has now retired as project manager with Bristol-based Midas Construction.

Mr Williams said: "I would not have worked in the industry for this long if I
had not enjoyed it and I've made some really good friends.

"Things have changed a good deal over the past 50 years, but I still have
immense respect for the people who work in construction - it will be hard to
walk away." Ian Fairbairn, director of Midas Construction, said: "He is a true
gentlemen who has gained immense respect, admiration and affection from the many
hundreds of people with whom he has worked for half a century."

Area hospitals receive awards

2010 Thomson Reuters announced Wednesday that Desert Valley Hospital and
Montclair Hospital Medical Center are among the winners of its prestigious Top
100 Hospitals award in the nation.

Desert Valley Hospital in Victorville is now among an elite group of hospitals
that have received this award five times in the category of small community
hospitals.

Montclair Hospital Medical Center in Montclair received the award for the first
time in the class of medium-size community hospitals.

The Thomson Reuters Top 100 Hospitals: National Benchmarks study evaluated
hospitals in 10 different performance categories: mortality, medical
complications, patient safety, average length of stay, expenses, profitability,
patient satisfaction, adherence to clinical standards of care, post discharge
mortality and readmission rates for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure,
and pneumonia.

Thomson Reuters evaluated nearly 3000 short-term, acute care, non-federal
hospitals.

The researchers used public information from Medicare cost reports, Medicare
Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) data, and the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare data set for core measures and patient
satisfaction.

Premier steps in |to fix health system

DAMNING media reports - including some of patients eating rotten and infested
food at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital and others dying at Steve Biko
Academic Hospital because of non-functioning machines - have prompted the
government to act.

Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane placed her provincial health department under
administration yesterday, hoping that a technical task team will resolve the
ills of Gauteng's health facilities.

However, the announcement does not affect the position of MEC for Health Hope
Papo, who will remain the department's political boss.

The administrator and technical team would report to him. Mokonyane said the
administration would be different from the Limpopo Health Department's
situation, as there was no national government intervention in Gauteng.

The premier said she was expecting the administrator to set up a technical team
that would focus on bringing changes to health logistics, hospital management,
human resources, financial management and communications.

She emphasised that the administrator and technical team would cease to exist
once the department's problems were over. She also said the team would work with
the acting head of department Ndoda Biyela until a new head had been appointed.

The DA welcomed Mokonyane's announcement.

'We'll never forget our friends';
School and community mourn 3 pupils who died in taxi-train crash

BYLINE:  NATASHA PRINCE Staff Reporter

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 416 words


PUPILS of Kasselsvlei Technical School vowed to "never forget" three of their
fellow pupils who were among nine children who died when their taxi was hit by a
train at a level crossing in Blackheath.

Pupils embraced and comforted one another during a memorial service at the
school yesterday in honour of Jason Pedro, 14, Nadine Martinissen, 16 and Jean
Pierre Willeman, 13.

"People live, people die, people laugh, people cryâ[#x20ac]¦ some say hi, some
say bye - others may forget you but never will Kasselsvlei High," was the ending
of a poem read by Moreese Snell, dedicated to the three pupils.

Others who died in the crash were Liesl August, 11, of Good Hope Primary; Cody
Erasmus, 15, of Bellville Technical; Jody Phillips, 13, of Bellville Technical;
Reece Smith, 7, of Kalkfontein Primary; Nolan Februarie, 13, of Kuilsriver
Technical High School; and Michaelin de Koker, 11, of Kalkfontein Primary.

Parents, relatives and friends of Jason, Nadine and Jean Pierre gathered in the
hall where photos of the pupils were hung on the walls and on a table, alongside
three candles that were lit for each of the |victims.

Pupils hugged, cried and consoled one another as hymns were sung.

Some relatives became so overwhelmed with emotion that they had to be escorted
out of the hall.

Kasselsvlei principal Ronald Bantom told the Cape Argus that not knowing who had
been killed until he had accompanied the parents to the mortuary on Wednesday
was a harrowing experience.

"I was not sure what to tell the staff, or the pupils," he said.

Western Cape Education Department circuit manager for the area Mapungu Qondisa,
said news of the collision had "shaken the whole country".

"This is a national tragedy and it is unbelievable to us," she said.

Police said the taxi driver had passed nine cars and swerved past a boom, trying
to rush across the tracks, when the approaching train hit |the vehicle.

The driver of the taxi was recovering in the Netcare Kuils River Hospital, said
hospital spokeswoman Karen Eagle yesterday. He was in a "very stable" condition.

He faces culpable homicide charges, as well as a charge of reckless and
negligent driving.

The health department said yesterday that one of the four patients admitted to
Tygerberg Hospital had been discharged and another patient had been transferred
to Kuils River Hospital on Wednesday night.

Two of the boys underwent surgery and were reported to be stable, while another
patient taken to Red Cross Children's Hospital was in the ICU, also in a stable
condition.

They are still collecting the sponsorship cash but hope to end up with more than
pounds 500 in total.

Neil Bates, of Fitness First in Cannon Park, said: "There were 11 of them doing
aerobics, step and weights for six hours."

 Provide a Project Summary:

 A partnership of leading digital inclusion advocates and broadband service
providers constructed a hybrid Fiber/Wireless Residential Broadband Pilot
Project with an embedded broadband adoption program that focused on providing
service to NYC's underserved public and affordable housing communities. Initial
project partners included Urban Communications Transport Corp., One Economy
Corp., WHCR FM 90.3 FM (City College of New York), SoBRO and Per Scholas,
together the Digital Divide Partnership (DDP). Over the course of the Project
the DDP expanded to include CCNY, the Harlem Hospital Center, the Bedford
Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., the Manhattan North, Manhattan South and the Bronx
South Districts Councils of New York City Housing Association (NYCHA) Resident
Association Presidents.

 The Project constructed a high-capacity wireless broadband network that
interconnects community anchor institutions, NYCHA developments and local
non-profit organizations in three (3) New York City boroughs, including the
Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn, with a Community Wide Area Network (CWAN). The
CWAN is an open broadband communications platform that contains redundant,
high-capacity links that enable each of the participating institutions and
organizations to create "smart neighborhoods" in their communities. CWAN members
deploy Wireless Technical Campuses (upgraded Wi-Fi Cloud Corridors) at their
respective public and affordable housing apartment building complexes, public
schools, public parks, outdoor plazas and municipal hospital. Each Wireless
Technical Campus contains multiple access points that provide wireless broadband
access across a radius of multiple city blocks. The Wireless Technical Campuses
range in size and homes passed based upon the housing density in each given
neighborhood, as well as the geographic distribution of the Campus node
locations. A critical component of the Wireless Technical Campuses is the
community-centric programming, services and applications that are delivered over
the network (see below). Wireless Technical Campus Have been installed in East
Harlem, Central Harlem (including Harlem Hospital), the Lower East Side, the
Upper West Side, the South Bronx, Central Brooklyn (including the Bedford
Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza), and historic Riverbank State Park in Harlem.

 Each Wireless Technical Campus accommodates potentially thousands of users, and
by early 2012 included over 400 wireless nodes directly passing 40,000 homes.
Pedestrian traffic equipped with mobile devices also has access to the network
throughout the neighborhoods, parks, plazas and hospital community covered by
the Wireless Technical Campuses, bringing the total potential user base to an
estimated 180,000 people, not including the 2 million annual visitors at
Riverbank State Park.

 The DDP broadband adoption program is embedded in the Wireless Technical
Campuses, and includes targeted digital content and applications that stimulate
the use of the wireless network, and broadband in general. Specific digital
content and applications have been developed over the last 5 years by the DDP
working in collaboration with its community partners, including the NYCHA
Resident Association Citywide Councils of Presidents Chairs in Manhattan and the
Bronx, WHCR 90.3 FM, and the CCNY. Digital content includes community-centric
educational, cultural, informational and emergency preparedness video
programming that is streamed live, as well as archived on-line, by the DDP's
content partner, Streaming University.

 Applications developed in collaboration with NYCHA resident association
leadership across two NYC boroughs include the DDP's Video Intercom and the
Virtual Tenant Patrol services, both of which have been enthusiastically
embraced by residents and local law enforcement alike for their positive impact
on the local quality-of-life (see Community Impact, below). Additionally, these
applications have significantly stimulated broadband engagement and adoption
among the Project's targeted communities.

 Describe the Community and Economic Impact as a result of the completion of
your project:

 The Project's primary target, the NYCHA residential community, has an
unemployment rate of 52.8%, an average household income of $23,150 (below the
federal "Poverty Line")and an estimated in-home broadband penetration of 50%.
The Project has made a tremendous impact upon this community by making free
wireless broadband service available to over 35,000 NYCHA and several thousand
affordable housing families, enabling them to access the rich informational
resources of the Internet, at home. Additionally, hundreds of hours of targeted,
community-focused, educational, informational and cultural programming have been
delivered by Streaming University over the wireless network to this population.
On-line learning opportunities have been stimulated and enhanced, with personal
and professional development programming made available to thousands of new
broadband users via the Wireless Technical Campuses.

 The DDP's Video Intercom service enables NYCHA residents to monitor their
building entrances, lobbies, courtyards and playgrounds from the comfort of
their home, and has become a compelling way for families to enhance their safety
and quality-of-life. Delivered over the DDP's Wireless Technical Campuses, as
well as the Internet itself, residents are able to view live images of their
development on their smart phones, tablets and other digital devices in
real-time. Additionally, the Video Intercom service has worked as a gateway
application that expands the in-home adoption and use of broadband, particularly
by Seniors, who regard the Video Intercom as a compelling service. The DDP's
Virtual Tenant Patrol service extends video monitoring capabilities to NYCHA
resident patrol groups, enabling them to monitor their development from mobile
devices remotely, as well as from their resident association office monitors.
Working with resident leaders, the NYPD has used the Virtual Tenant Patrol
service to locate missing children and to gather other information helpful in
the performance of their duties. Many relieved families, scores of individual
residents and resident association leadership across multiple boroughs have
reported the impact of the Video Intercom and Virtual Tenant Patrol applications
to be transformative and overwhelmingly positive.

 Riverbank State Park was the first NY State Park to offer free public Wi-Fi for
their visitors, estimated at 2 million annually. The DDP has provided ubiquitous
Wi-Fi access, via its Riverbank Wireless Technical Campus, throughout the 28
acre outdoor and indoor Park facilities in support of the annual NYCHA Senior
Benefit Fair, the annual New York Urban League Historically Black Colleges and
Universities Fair, and other major exhibitors and Park vendors since 2010.
Typical of the impact, the NYCHA Senior Benefit Fair has averaged nearly 2,000
seniors from all five NYC boroughs, many of whom learned about email, Internet
searching and social media for the first time as a result of the Riverbank
Wireless Technical Campus. Similarly, the Historically Black Colleges and
Universities Fair has been able to successfully access school websites, process
student applications, and gather related educational information in real-time
for several years thanks to the Riverbank Wireless Technical Campus.

 The DDP has worked as the technology partner of the WHCR Emergency Broadcast
Team (WEBT) at CCNY since its creation following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. WEBT's
mission is to provide emergency preparedness, mitigation and recovery
information for the Harlem and northern Manhattan communities that is broadcast
over WHCR 90.3 FM during emergencies, as well as community news and information
during normal times. In furtherance of this mandate, the DDP has interconnected
its community-based Wireless Technical Campuses with the Network Operations
Center (NOC) at WEBT/CCNY in order to collect and disseminate local,
community-focused information in real-time for broadcast. As part of this
undertaking, the DDP installed an emergency back-up wireless connection at the
Harlem Hospital Center, interconnecting their Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
with WEBT/CCNY NOC and Wireless Technical Campus locations. The WEBT/CCNY NOC
and Harlem Hospital EOC wireless links are each connected to backup power
generators for emergency operation during electrical blackouts. Several of the
DDP's Wireless Technical Campuses at NYCHA developments also have backup
solar-powered access points for emergency use during power failures.

 In addition to the emergency communications link, in 2014 the DDP completed the
installation of its Wireless Technical Campus at Harlem Hospital, providing free
public Wi-Fi service to hundreds of hospital visitors and patients in waiting
rooms and clinics on a daily basis.

 In Brooklyn the DDP has worked with the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration
Corporation to install a Wireless Technical Campus at their 300,000 square foot
Restoration Plaza. Hundreds of visitors per day now have access to free public
Wi-Fi and community-based programming as they visit the many stores and offices
at the Plaza, or merely hang out at the attractive outdoor plaza facilities.

 In the Bronx, the DDP completed the installation of a Wireless Technical Campus
at the SoBRO (South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corp.) Venture Center.
The Venture Center Wireless Technical Campus provides backup Internet service to
the 20+ small businesses located in this South Bronx community-based office
complex. The Wireless Technical Campus includes a wireless link with the Harlem
Hospital EOC and the WEBT/CCNY NOC for use during emergencies.

 Project Conclusions and Recommendations:

 The DDP Residential Broadband Pilot Project has been successful in meeting all
of its goals as summarized in this Report, exceeding expectations despite
receiving only one-third of the total amount of the contract award, due to an
apparent shortfall in State funding availability. The need for ubiquitous
Internet access and adoption across all economic, geographic, and demographic
lines, particularly the poor and people of color, is well documented, and indeed
was the impetus for the State's funding of this Project. The primary objective
of the five (5) year Pilot Project to explore and demonstrate an operating model
that addressed this concern was met, and has resulted in the following
conclusions and recommendations:

 1. The only "affordable" broadband service that works for the unemployed and
families living below the Poverty Level is FREE Universal Broadband Service;

 2. A socially conscious, non-profit oriented Internet service provider (ISP)
can partner with community non-profit anchor institutions and resident
associations to create viable community-based technological ecosystems that are
locally managed, self-sustaining and that address the needs of underserved
residents;

 3. There must be broadband services and applications targeted to specific needs
of the community in order to enhance relevance and stimulate adoption of the
transformative power of the Internet by historically underserved communities.

 . In addition to the above precepts, the DDP believes that FREE wireless
gigabit level broadband (Wi-Fi) can and must be provided in the apartment
buildings, developments and homes where the poor and underserved live, not just
outside in the neighborhood, down the block and around the corner. The DDP urges
the State to continue its funding support of this groundbreaking and critical
initiative so that the community-based Wireless Technical Campus ecosystem can
be expanded and continue to provide technology training and entrepreneurial
opportunities for local residents to participate in the creation, management and
programming of their own technological empowerment.

 Provide a Project Summary:

 A partnership of leading digital inclusion advocates and broadband service
providers constructed a hybrid Fiber/Wireless Residential Broadband Pilot
Project with an embedded broadband adoption program that focused on providing
service to NYC's underserved public and affordable housing communities. Initial
project partners included Urban Communications Transport Corp., One Economy
Corp., WHCR FM 90.3 FM (City College of New York), SoBRO and Per Scholas,
together the Digital Divide Partnership (DDP). Over the course of the Project
the DDP expanded to include CCNY, the Harlem Hospital Center, the Bedford
Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., the Manhattan North, Manhattan South and the Bronx
South Districts Councils of New York City Housing Association (NYCHA) Resident
Association Presidents.

 The Project constructed a high-capacity wireless broadband network that
interconnects community anchor institutions, NYCHA developments and local
non-profit organizations in three (3) New York City boroughs, including the
Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn, with a Community Wide Area Network (CWAN). The
CWAN is an open broadband communications platform that contains redundant,
high-capacity links that enable each of the participating institutions and
organizations to create "smart neighborhoods" in their communities. CWAN members
deploy Wireless Technical Campuses (upgraded Wi-Fi Cloud Corridors) at their
respective public and affordable housing apartment building complexes, public
schools, public parks, outdoor plazas and municipal hospital. Each Wireless
Technical Campus contains multiple access points that provide wireless broadband
access across a radius of multiple city blocks. The Wireless Technical Campuses
range in size and homes passed based upon the housing density in each given
neighborhood, as well as the geographic distribution of the Campus node
locations. A critical component of the Wireless Technical Campuses is the
community-centric programming, services and applications that are delivered over
the network (see below). Wireless Technical Campus Have been installed in East
Harlem, Central Harlem (including Harlem Hospital), the Lower East Side, the
Upper West Side, the South Bronx, Central Brooklyn (including the Bedford
Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza), and historic Riverbank State Park in Harlem.

 Each Wireless Technical Campus accommodates potentially thousands of users, and
by early 2012 included over 400 wireless nodes directly passing 40,000 homes.
Pedestrian traffic equipped with mobile devices also has access to the network
throughout the neighborhoods, parks, plazas and hospital community covered by
the Wireless Technical Campuses, bringing the total potential user base to an
estimated 180,000 people, not including the 2 million annual visitors at
Riverbank State Park.

 The DDP broadband adoption program is embedded in the Wireless Technical
Campuses, and includes targeted digital content and applications that stimulate
the use of the wireless network, and broadband in general. Specific digital

Blast probe: 3-member panel visits hospital

SECTION: INDORE

LENGTH: 310 words


Indore : A day after the blast in air compressor at private Curewell Hospital,
district chief medical and health officer (CMHO ) sent a 3-member team
comprising Dr Mahesh Malviya, Dr G L Sodhi and Dr M C Jinwal to check the faults
that led to the incident. The committee will submit a report to the CMHO for
appropriate action into the matter. Talking to TOI, CMHO, Dr S L Porwal said,
"We have sent a team to probe the incident.

It is duty of the hospital administration to get the technical inspections done
on a regular basis. The committee will be submitting a report following which
further action will be taken."Dr Porwal said that it is the responsibility of
engineers employed by the hospital to periodically check technical aspects. When
asked whether health department conducts routine inspection to avoid any such
incident, he said, "We do look for such loopholes when registration/license is
renewed, which is done once in three years. Random inspections are also done
when required."There are nearly 200 nursing homes operating in the city and over
2000 clinics that cater to the needs of patients. While health department say it
is a responsibility of concerned hospital administration to get the technical
inspections done, the department lacks manpower to maintain a check on hospital
activities. "We do not have people to keep a check on large number of hospitals
and clinics. Also, we cannot carry inspection frequently as it raises question
on our intent," said Dr Porwal. Sources said that MP Nursing Home Act empowers
the health department to give licence/registration to run the hospital following
a series of inspections about infrastructure, staff and equipment. "CMHO is
empowered to take action against the hospital if the norms laid in the act are
not complied," a health department official said.

HC rejects plea to grant land at cheaper rate to institutes

LENGTH: 585 words

DATELINE: New Delhi


New Delhi, March 28 -- The Delhi High Court has rejected the plea of a group of
private educational institutes seeking a direction to DDA to allot them nazul
land at a cheaper rate rather than auctioning at market price for establishing
higher/technical education institutes and schools.

Dismissing a batch of petitions, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and SK
Mishra said, "The clear mode of disposal of nazul land for hospitals,
dispensaries, higher or technical education institutes and schools, would
continue to be by way of auction" while referring to the amended rules in 2006
with regard to the DDA Act.

"We are unable to accept the plea that there is any unguided power conferred
under the said rules which is capable of being misused. It is, in fact, the past
misuses which gave rise to the amendments with a view to minimise arbitrary
exercise of excessive discretion," it said.

The bench accepted DDA's argument that the agency was entitled to either auction
the land or allot it at pre-determined rates for establishment of higher/
technical education institutes, schools or hospitals, but no proper safeguard or
guidelines have been put in force as to whom land is to be allotted and by which
mode.

"We are of the considered view that the interpretation of rules placed before us
by the DDA is the correct view and the petitioners have no case in this behalf
in view of no allotment having matured in their favour prior to the amendments
of the said rules," it said.

The court was hearing the group of petitions dealing with Higher/Technical
Education Institutes and Schools that the right to education should be treated
on a different pedestal.

GMCH without power for 12 minutes

BYLINE: A Staff Reporter

LENGTH: 255  words


Guwahati, May 12: Disruption of power at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital
(GMCH) last night for about 12 minutes led to chaos among patients and
attendants.

However, the hospital administration today claimed power was soon restored and
none of the patients in serious condition were affected as the intensive care
units of the hospital had additional backup.

As soon as the power supply got disrupted, attendants and patients got worried
as the heat was unbearable yesterday.

The fact that disruption of power can also cause medical equipment, used in
providing support to critically ill patients, to malfunction was also a cause of
concern.

The power disruption had occurred because of a technical error in the generator
of the hospital. The power was restored after 12 minutes. At present, the
hospital has 17 generators for uninterrupted power supply.

"It is true that the power supply to the building of our hospital was disrupted
for 12 minutes. The disruption had occurred as the generators developed a
technical problem and people here had difficulty in restarting them. However,
the technical problem was sorted out and power was soon restored. Although
patients had to face problems during this short duration, no serious patient was
affected as there was additional power backup for intensive care units in the
hospital. Power disruption mainly affected the emergency department," said Babul
Kr Bezbaruah, superintendent of the GMCH.

"We have 17 generators in the hospital and they are now operating smoothly,"
said Bezbaruah.

Pillars' coach, others in auto crash

LENGTH: 297 words


·Blame loss on Ramadan

By EMMA NJOKU

The vehicle conveying the technical crew of Kano Pillars was involved in a road
accident yesterday, less than 24 hours after the team crashed out of this year's
Federation Cup.

Media Officer of the club, Idris Mailikawa, who broke the news to Daily
SunSports said the accident occurred along Zaria-Kano Road apparently on their
way home from Wednesday's Federation Cup quarterfinal match against Warri Wolves
in Ilorin, which Pillars lost 3-0.

Although details of the accident were sketchy, Mailikawa, however, disclosed
that the technical adviser, Mohammed Baba Ganaru was among those that sustained
injuries of various degrees. As at the time of filling this report, the
casualties were said to have been taken to the Nasarawa General Hospital in
Kano, where they are receiving treatment.

"The official car of our technical crew was involved in an accident along
Zaria-Kano Road and we are on our way to Nasarawa General Hospital, Kano for
treatment to the technical adviser and other casualties" the media officer wrote
in a text to Nigeria League Menu.

However, Coach Baba Ganaru had blamed his team's ouster from the 2013 Federation
Cup on the ongoing Ramadan.

Two goals from Musa Najare and one from Oghenekaro Etebo in the first half
ensured Warri Wolves move on with a 3-0 victory, and Pillars crash out in the
quarter final game played in Ilorin on Wednesday July 31, 2013. Ganaru watched
his players as they sluggishly trail their more-lively opponent who he described
as a very good side.

When asked why the players conceded such huge defeat, Ganaru did not mince
words. "The fast affected us because we could have played better," he said.
Pillars top the Nigerian Premier League table, and will host Akwa United this
weekend in a week 23 game.

Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital (JDWNRH)

LENGTH: 857 words

DATELINE: India


India, June 12 -- The National Referral Hospital Trusts Matrix Time-Attendance
and Access Control Solutions

Project Highlights:

Application: Access Control, Time-Attendance and Visitor Management

Users: 3,000

Devices: 200+

Locations: Thimphu, Bhutan (Single Location)

Industry: Healthcare

Introduction:

The Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital is one of the top most
renowned institutions in Bhutan delivering Healthcare services. The hospital
caters to the population of Thimphu and neighboring districts. The hospital not
only functions as the National Referral Hospital for the entire country but also
functions as: Regional Referral Hospital for the Western District, District
Hospital for Thimphu District, Human Resources Pool and Technical Backup for
District Hospitals, Clinical Training Centre for the Royal Institute of Health
Sciences (RIHS) and Technical Support to the Public Health Programs.

Challenges:

As the hospital works round the clock, one of the major concerns was to manage
complex shifts of employees. Elevator control, where only users with access
rights can call the elevator, was another challenge the hospital wanted to meet.
Furthermore, the customer also wanted a solution, with the help of which the
admin could assign entry and exit points for patients, visitors and employees.
Lastly, the management wanted to restrict visitor entry to a pre-defined time
and rooms of the hospital for better visitor management.

Solution Offered:

Matrix pitched its Access Control, Time-Attendance and Visitor Management
Solution along with the different variants of biometric devices, which fulfills
every requirement of this renowned Hospital. Around 206 devices were installed
in the hospital, which are used in controlling access at rooms and elevators.
Devices were installed at the Main Entrance, Ward Rooms, Server Rooms, Outside
Elevators and at Ramps on every floor to restrict access. So, there is no
individual in the building who is not enrolled in the system. As the Hospital
works 24 hours, there are multiple shifts in which the employees work. Through
this, the Hospital could manage multiple shifts of employees. Approximately, 700
visitor profiles were created with constrained time to visit, limited rooms to
enter and a pre-defined route of access. Also, crowd at the elevator was
controlled by restricting the use to only users with elevator access rights.

Results:

JDWNRH fulfilled its requirement with Matrix People Mobility Solution and
achieved the following results:

Simplified Security by Restricting Un-authorized Entry

Reduced Complexity of Shifts

Crowd Controlling through Elevator Access Control

Time based and Zone based Entry Restrictions for Visitors and Patients

Poor patients at CMCH suffering

LENGTH: 368  words

DATELINE: LARKANA


LARKANA, Oct. 8 -- All development schemes at Chandka Medical College Hospital
are in crisis due to the non-availability of engineering wing at the largest
teaching hospital of Upper Sindh.

It has been learnt that two sanctioned posts of civil engineer and electrical
engineer are still vacant since long, which has complicated the situation.

No postings on the said positions have been made yet despite repeated letters by
the hospital administration.

In this connection, CMCH Medical Superintendent Dr. Javed Ali Shaikh wrote a
letter on Friday to Health Secretary informing him about this serious situation.

He stated that previously Executive Engineer, Provincial Building Division,
Larkana, was supervising the civil works and also providing technical sanction
of the new projects of ADP and M&R.

But he has refused to do so for one year due to which almost all development
works came to a standstill including the establishment of Faryal Talpur Cardiac
Surgery Complex, stated Dr Javed.

The center has facilities of coronary angiography, cardiac catheterized
laboratory, cardiac bypass surgery, and chest surgery.

"The matter was taken up at various forums but still to be resolved", the MS
wrote, adding that due to the non-availability of engineering wing serious
technical nature issues have emerged.

He stated that Director General (Design), Building Department, Government of
Sindh, is not authenticating the estimate of the hospital and technical sanction
of the estimates are not given by competent authorities which are must.

Dr. Javed requested to the Health Secretary to approach Communication & Works
Department Secretary either to depute an executive engineer/assistant engineer
at CMCH or to authorize XEN District Building Larkana and concerned
Superintending Engineer to extend technical support and supervise

civil works.

Also, he added, direct DG (Design) & Chief Engineer Building to authenticate
estimates and give technical sanction respectively to CMCH schemes in the larger
interest of poor patients.

BRIEF: Corwin union faces decertification

BYLINE: Jeff Tucker, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 217 words


Aug. 07--Employees at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center have filed petitions with
the National Labor Relations Board to decertify the one union at the hospital.

Hospital officials confirmed this week that petitions were filed to decertify
the Communication Workers of America's collective bargaining unit, which
represents about 73 positions in a number of the hospital's support departments.

Spokeswoman Rochelle Kelly Wristen said those positions are in the nutrition
services, environmental services, patient scheduling, maintenance and
facilities, clinical support, technical and technical support departments.

The hospital's three-year collective bargaining agreement with the union is set
to expire this year.

The petitions to decertify the union will require a vote of the entire unit.

But there's no date yet for that election, the hospital said.

In a statement, the hospital said: "We support their right and hope that our
employees have the opportunity to vote soon. The union has filed blocking
charges which will be investigated by the NLRB. Once the charges are resolved,
we believe the employees will get an opportunity to vote."

New nursing program: Associate degree in nursing now offered at Val Tech

BYLINE: Johnna Pinholster, The Valdosta Daily Times, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 554 words


Oct. 22--VALDOSTA  -- An associate degree in nursing is now available at
Valdosta Technical College.

The program enrolled its first 25 students who began class at the end of
September.

The degree was made available at Valdosta Tech through a partnership with
Southwest Georgia Technical College in Thomasville.

An open house on Wednesday introduced the medical community to the program and
its first batch of students.

Darlene Boyd, RN, MSN, a faculty member at Southwest Georgia Technical College,
said students will spend 18 months in the program.

The next class is tentatively scheduled to start in October of 2010, she said.

The program is accredited by the Georgia Board of Nursing and the National
League of Nursing Accrediting Commission.

The students will do clinicals at South Georgia Medical Center, Smith Northview
Hospital, Brooks County Hospital and Greenleaf.

"The intention is to have them stay in the community to serve," Boyd said.

The entire nation is experiencing a nursing shortage, with many hospitals,
including SGMC, having to hire traveling nurses to fill positions, she said.

Much of the equipment in the classroom was donated by hospitals. Students will
be working with IV simulators and iStan, life-size human models that function
much like a real person.

The college has two iStans, one man and a baby, that breath, cry, have a pulse
and tell patients where they feel bad, Boyd said.

"On these, students do simulations that we would not allow on a real life
patient," she said.

The class is served by a part-time instructor and full-time instructor Tamara
Bryant, RN, MSN.

Students who enter the program can take their required core courses at Valdosta
Tech and use HOPE and Pell grants to help cover the cost of the degree.

Before the program came to Valdosta Tech many students were taking their core
courses at the college then transferring to Southwest Georgia Technical College
or Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College to their associate nursing programs,
said Glenn Deibert, president of Southwest Georgia Technical College.

Student Kristin Harrington said the opportunity to be one of the first students
in the program is a great one.

"I love class. We get a good mix of lectures, videos and hands-on things as
well," Harrington said. "I'm looking forward to working with real people."

After she graduates Harrington hopes to work in psychiatric or drug
rehabilitation.

The students start clinicals in two weeks at Presbyterian Home in Quitman and
then head to SGMC in January, Bryant said.

To be an applicant for the program students must have an overall grade point
average of 2.5 and four core courses  -- two in biology, one in English and one
in math.

Prospective students must also pass a pre-admission test that costs $40.

25 operations delayed due to power cut at Dublin hospital

BYLINE: By EITHNE DONNELLAN

SECTION: CITY EDITION; HOME NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 311 words


A cancer patient who was about to undergo surgery at a Dublin hospital this week
had his operation put off for another two weeks after a power cut resulted in a
number of operations having to be rescheduled.

A relative said that the patient, who was only recently diagnosed, was all
"psyched up" for the surgery and is upset at the prospect of having to wait
another fortnight for his operation. He is also concerned about the clinical
consequences of the delay, the relative said.

A spokesman for St James's Hospital said 25 operations had to be rescheduled as
a result of technical difficulties which arose following a power cut at the
hospital on Monday. He stressed that any emergencies scheduled for the day were
carried out late on Monday evening as theatres stayed open for longer than
usual.

Furthermore, he said 14 patients' operations were rescheduled for yesterday.

He added that while the hospital could not comment on individual cases it
appreciated the patient's concerns in this case and was itself concerned that
anyone's operation had to be rescheduled.

The technical problems at the hospital occurred after electricity supplies were
restored and one of the internal electrical breakers failed to reset. This
internal fault disrupted services even though the hospital has its own
generator. A statement from the hospital said: "This caused a power outage to
one of the main patient service areas of the hospital for periods ranging from
one to three hours. The outage disrupted hospital services primarily in
theatres, radiology and cardiology.

"Arrangements are being made to address any consequential backlogs as speedily
as possible. There were no adverse patient clinical occurrences associated with
the outage".

It added the technical difficulties which occurred would be investigated to
ensure they did not happen again.

Saints Medical bond rating takes a hit from Moody's

BYLINE: Chris Camire, The Sun, Lowell, Mass.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 642 words


June 25--LOWELL -- Saints Medical Center's bond rating was downgraded by Moody's
Investors Services this week due to its high debt load, multiyear operating
losses and dwindling cash supply. The hospital has $51 million of outstanding
bonds issued by the Massachusetts Health & Educational Facilities Authority. The
hospital's cash on hand fell to 44 days. Moody's downgraded the hospital's
credit rating to "Ba3" from "Ba2." The hospital is highly leveraged with its
cash-to-debt ratio declining to 42.4 percent with debt-to-cash flow rising to an
unfavorable level of about 16 times, said Moody's Meanwhile, Saints is
negotiating with the federal government over a civil fine for apparently
violating a doctor-referral law that could see the hospital pay a penalty as low
as $785,000 or as high as $14.5 million.

The hospital released a statement expressing disappointment that a change
occurred in the long-term rating of its bonds. The rating will not have any
immediate impact on day-to-day hospital operations, according to Saints. "The
financial data on which Moody's decision is based, and which is included in the
Moody's opinion, is not new information beyond what was reported in May in
conjunction with the release of Saints' audited financial statements," said the
hospital. Stephen Guimond, Saints' interim CEO, and Gary Campbell, chairman of
the board of trustees, have emphasized that the civil fines the hospital may
face involve "no fraud, no abuse" but technical violations of the federal Stark
Law. The 1989 law adopted to ferret out fraud and abuse in the Medicare system
prohibits a doctor from making referrals to a health-care provider for certain
health services that are reimbursable by Medicare if that doctor has a
"financial relationship" with the health-care provider. Saints has not been
accused of wrongdoing but has -- on its own -- admitted to "technical omissions"
and "technical compliance violations" on contracts between doctors and the
hospital. The hospital said it is working with political leaders and its legal
counsel to resolve these technical compliance issues, which date back decades.
Moody's three-page report does contain bright spots for the hospital. It notes
that Saints is pursuing a strategy to capture a larger share of the
out-migration market that currently goes to regional community hospitals. To
build referrals for this market, Saints has expanded its employed physician
base, concentrating on placing primary-care physicians in offices in areas where
it seeks to grow market share. The employed physician group has grown to 36 from
only four in 2005 and includes 14 primary-care physicians, according to Moody's.
"As always, we remain committed to providing the highest quality community
hospital care in a compassionate Catholic setting," said the hospital. Saints is
in a very competitive market with Lowell General Hospital, which offers a
similar services, according to the Moody's report. Most specialists admit
patients to both hospitals, but in recent years several physicians in different
specialties, including obstetrics, were recruited away from Saints by Lowell
General. The report states that strategic capital spending is vital for Saints'
ability to compete with Lowell General, which is a larger hospital with more
services, having 214 beds to Saints' 108 beds. Lowell General captures 32.5
percent of the market share to Saints' 22.2 percent.

Skills certs for house keepers

                                November 4, 1999


HOUSEKEEPERS cleaning hospitals can now earn a Certificate of Competency (COC)
-a basic qualification they need to move up the skills ladder.

The certificate, issued by cleaning contractor UMC ServiceMaster after clearing
a new three-month course, will help open the door for housekeepers to sign up
for other training courses to upgrade their skills.

The qualification, which will be recognised by the Institute of Technical
Education (ITE), will lead to several benefits, said the firm's general manager
Lee Chin Thai yesterday.

These include enhancement of market value, making it easier for them to get new
jobs, promotion with current employers and greater earnings as team leaders.
Many housekeepers are women in their 40s with only primary education, he said.

The course was launched last month with 15 employees of the KK Women's and
Children's Hospital, Mount Alvernia, Changi and Singapore General hospitals
being trained at KK hospital.

Trainees are taught, among other things, how to clean carpets in hospital rooms
and provide services to patients.

UMC ServiceMaster is the first firm authorised by ITE to conduct COC training in
housekeeping operations in the health-care industry.

The Senior Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline Wong, who was
guest-of-honour at a ceremony marking the firm's status as the approved training
centre yesterday, described the award to the company as an example of the
tripartite partnership between the ITE, a restructured hospital and a public
company.

She said: "I hope to see more organisations in the health-care industry work
towards providing better services in other aspects of the industry as well.

"We cannot underestimate the importance of the need for Singapore to develop a
world-class health-care industry, as manpower remains an important economic
resource in our context, and the contribution of older workers becomes more
crucial to Singapore."

Fresh glitch crashes hospital lab s IT system

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 327 words


The latest fault in the system   which was crippled for several weeks last
August   occurred on Wednesday morning and brought the system down for most of
the day. IT staff responded immediately and managed to fully restore the system
by the evening.

But while the system was down, laboratory staff had to report results manually
and urgent tests were processed before those classed as routine or non urgent.

CUH management apologised to service users for any delays experienced,  the HSE
said last night.  Hospital management also extended their thanks to staff and
all parties who worked to urgently resolve the issue and restore the system.

The centralised computer system supports services at CUH, Kerry General, Mallow
General, Bantry General, and the Mercy Hospital s blood transfusion lab.

Last August the IT system was hit by a major technical fault which lasted
several weeks, forcing lab staff to process tests manually and work extra hours
to cope with the backlog.

The problems persisted until mid-September when it emerged CUH management had
been warned about the system s shortcomings two years earlier.

The HSE insisted last night however, that there have been no technical issues
since those experienced in September.

A spokesperson said additional monitoring was put in place at the time which has
worked well, and which helped identify Wednesday s technical issues at the
earliest opportunity .

The issue was identified by the additional monitoring arrangements in place in
CUH and the hospital s ICT department worked with the system supplier to restore
the system as quickly as possible. The system was fully restored by evening,
she said.

Contingency arrangements were put in place to continue to provide the required
essential diagnostic services to the hospital departments, GPs, and other
community services, all of whom were informed of the technical issues.

It is understood that the HSE has given approval to invest  400,000 in the
system.

ACE probes use of low quality material in Naurang hospital

SECTION: Vol. LXVII No. 216

LENGTH: 364  words


The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has launched probe into alleged use of
substandard construction material in the building of tehsil headquarters
hospital, Naurang.

A team of ACE paid a surprise visit to the hospital on Wednesday to check the
material used in its building. The probe was ordered by ACE provincial director
Ziaullah Toru, who had received complaints about the use of substandard material
in the hospital's building.

The ACE team, led by its technical officer in Peshawar Attique Farooq and Lakki
circle officer Shahid Adnan, inspected different portions of the hospital and
checked quality of work.

The team noticed that several portions of the building had developed cracks
while the doors and windows were made of low quality wood. It also checked the
material used in the foundation of the building and sanitary work carried out in
the hospital.

Mr Adnan told this correspondent by telephone that they visited the hospital
thoroughly for the second time during the last one and half month. He said that
ACE technical staff would assess losses inflicted on national exchequer owing to
use of substandard material in the hospital's building.

"In the light of the report of technical staff, ACE will initiate action against
the contractors and officials concerned of communication and works department as
per the law," he said.

TRANSFER: District Police Officer Ismail Kharak on Wednesday reshuffled eight
subordinate officers, including two SHOs, and removed two assistant
sub-inspectors (ASIs) for poor performance.

According to a notification, Lakki SHO Inspector Zafrullah Khan was transferred
and posted as Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station SHO. His predecessor SI Gul
Mohammad was posted as SHO of Lakki police station.

Likewise, additional SHO of Tajori Ghulam Mohammad and line officer ASI Ajmal
Khan were made heads of Shahbazkhel and Wanda Banochi posts respectively.

ASI Abdul Hakim, who was serving as naib court in district courts, was
transferred and posted at Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station.

Two ASIs including chief of Serai Gambila police post Farman Khan and head of
judicial complex post Habibur Rehman were directed to report to police lines.

HOSPITALS TRAVEL TO FIND NURSES

BYLINE: ROBIN WILLIAMS ADAMS The Ledger

SECTION: Life; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 944 words


Hospital officials appreciate Florida lawmakers' effort to help with the nursing
shortage, but they aren't sitting back and waiting for new laws to give them the
employees they need.

They're doing their own recruiting from a variety of sources -- as close as the
nearest middle school and as far away as the Philippines.

Winter Haven Hospital's nursing administrators are awaiting the arrival of 40
nurses that two of them traveled to Manila to interview.

These are nurses with four-year degrees who speak and understand English well,
says Susie Hart, divisional director of Regency Medical Center. They could work
at Regency, Winter Haven Hospital or Lake Wales Medical Centers.

Before being allowed to practice in the United States, she says, they will need
to pass a nursing competency exam required for people trained in foreign
countries to practice here.

Another seven are lined up as alternates, so the number could grow to 47, she
says.

Winter Haven Hospital found these nurses through Nurses to USA, a company
hospital workers heard about from Shands Hospital at the University of Florida
in Gainesville, which Hart says has recruited nurses in the same country.

"Nursing jobs there are scarce," Hart says. "There are waiting lines, because
they have so many nurses. It's just the opposite of what we have here."

Florida hospitals report an almost 16 percent vacancy rate for registered
nurses, the Florida Hospital Association says.

Lakeland Regional Medical Center recruits 20 percent to 30 percent of its nurses
from out of state, says Phyllis Watson, vice president and chief nurse
executive. The hospital also hired a number of nurses from Canada two or three
years ago, about half of whom stayed.

Much of its focus now, however, is on cultivating a greater supply of future
nurses closer to home. That includes a major emphasis on middle-school and
high-school students.

Working with the public school system, Lakeland Regional is sponsoring a
licensed practical nurse program for Lakeland High School. The first one from
LHS graduates this year, Watson says.

LHS students will take their licensed practical nurse classes at Traviss
Technical Center now, but hospital nurses hope ultimately there will be enough
interest to teach a class at the high school

A program to let students shadow health professionals throughout the academic
year was finalized this year, Watson says.

"We need to be recruiting our own people into health care," Watson says, adding
that middle school is the ideal time to interest students in health careers.

The success of these programs and others to persuade more people to become
nurses will determine the quality of care that patients receive in the future,
as many of today's nurses retire.

Polk Community College, hospitals, the school system and others are involved in
a Nursing and Allied Health Advisory Council to address what local health
providers need.

A subcommittee is working to better coordinate activities, such as school
visits, career days, scholarships, visits to PCC and overall marketing of
nursing and other health jobs.

"These activities, at least to some degree, have been going on for a long time,"
says Sharon Davis, the registered nurse who directs PCC's nursing program.

"The difference now will be that they will be coordinated, expanded, done better
and hopefully with more impact."

Billboards, countywide radio messages and pamphlets on health careers are some
of the unified approaches being considered, says Nat West, a Winter Haven
Hospital vice president, who heads the subcommittee.

In addition to schools, he says, hospitals and medical groups may recruit at
Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs, through church groups and through service groups,
such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Registered nurses aren't the only health speciality in short supply at
hospitals, nursing homes and other health facilities.

More licensed practical nurses are needed. So are certified nursing assistants,
particularly in nursing homes, which are under a state mandate to increase the
time employees spend doing patient care.

There are some hopeful signs that more people are considering health-related
fields.

Enrollment in PCC's two-year registered nursing program is increasing. About 50
enrolled in the January class, compared to 40 in the August 2001 class, Davis
says. She said she hopes the number will reach 55 or 60 this August.

Davis says she also hopes PCC will be able to hire a recruiter again to promote
nursing full-time.

Traviss Technical Center's LPN class, which starts in August, is full. Ridge
Technical Center will apply for state approval to start an LPN class there,
making the training available on both sides of Polk County, says Lisa Harden,
the Polk school system's director of career, technical and adult education.

Interest also is strong for the technical centers' other programs, she says.

Traviss trains students to become certified nursing assistants, phlebotomists,
health unit coordinators, dental assistants, optometry assistants and massage
therapists. Ridge trains people to be certified nursing assistants, massage
therapists and patient care technicians, a category that includes CNA,
phlebotomy and electrocardiogram aide. Students can take individual parts of the
patient care technician program, Harden says.

In another move that might make nurses' training more accessible, the community
college and technical centers are discussing ways to make training hours more
flexible.

Hospital moves into future .

SECTION: News

LENGTH: 299 words



PRINCESS Margaret Hospital in Swindon will move its entire operation two miles
east, to the Commonhead site of the new Great Western Hospital in 32 weeks.


Les Meaton, who is overseeing the project, has been drafted in as commissioning
co-ordinator of Swindon and Marlborough NHS Trust's redevelopment team.


He heads a team that has spent months putting together a timetable for the move.


He is working alongside Sheila Moakes, commissioning manager for United Medical
Services, a private company brought in to help facilitate the move.


He said: "Everything has to be worked out in the finest detail.


"You have to almost play devil's advocate to identify potential problems that
might arise," he said.


The move has been broken down into two main areas, technical and operational.


Under the technical heading are issues relating to ensuring the new hospital
building is up and running by November 5.


This includes making sure that every aspect of the new building complies with
building regulations, such as checking water and electricity supplies as well as
all medical gases fitted to every one of the hospital's beds.


Every test has to be witnessed by at least one other person before it can be
checked off the list.


The second stage of the technical commissioning process involves testing all the
large pieces of medical equipment, from scanners to computer networks.


Running alongside this are the preparations for the operational commissioning of
the hospital.


The new GBP 132 million Great Western Hospital at Commonhead will take 464
inpatient beds and 87-day case beds.


It will have 19 per cent more clinical floor space than Princess Margaret
Hospital and will be supported by a 60-bed rehabilitation unit.

Much-needed overhaul: Four hospitals across Punjab to be renovated

LENGTH: 354  words


At least four hospitals across the province are being revamped by the Punjab
government through technical support received from WHO.

The facilities are Jinnah Hospital Lahore, Allied Hospital Faisalabad, Benazir
Bhutto Hospital Rawalpindi and Children Hospital Multan.

Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Secretary Najam Ahmed Shah said
this while addressing a WHO delegation at his office on Tuesday.

"The main objective of this initiative is to resolve the administrative issues,
rectify deficiencies of infrastructure and improve cleanliness," he added

According to Shah, healthcare service delivery at teaching hospitals will be
improved and quality healthcare facilities would be provided to patients.

"[This is only possible] if gaps in medicine supply and storage system are
removed, a dynamic system for outdoor and emergency patients is developed and a
referral system is introduced for patients," he added.

Shah said the government is welcoming the technical cooperation of international
experts from WHO to revamp the tertiary care hospitals in Punjab.

According to Shah, the decision to revamp tertiary care hospitals and primary
and secondary hospitals has been carried out to minimise workload at teaching
hospitals, address difficulties faced by patients and improve performance and
efficiency at public sector hospitals.

"It would also stop the flow of patients towards tertiary care hospitals as
quality health services would be available at DHQ hospitals," he added.

Shah said the differentiation between OPD and emergency patients is also
essential.

"[This will help hospitals] pay proper attention [to them] and offer health care
to patients who are in critical condition," he said. "It is widely observed that
beds in emergency wards are often filled by patients who are suffering from
minor diseases."

Shah said referral system is being introduced for this purpose to reduce the
workload of tertiary hospitals by 30% or more.

"WHO experts would visit hospitals," he said. "They will submit their technical
recommendations to the secretary within a week after completion of their visit,"
the secretary added.

ICT Technical Cooperation Project (St. Kitts and Nevis)

LENGTH: 593  words


Region: Caribbean
Implementation Start Date: 2013/1/1
Implementation End Date: 2017/12/31
Approval Amount: USD1,500,000
Source of Funding: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan)


Project Description: Joseph N. France General Hospital (JNF Hospital) is St.
Kitts and Nevis main medical institution. At present, however, most of the
hospitals operating procedures involve manual processes, which are inefficient
and can result in inaccuracies; the only operations done electronically are
outpatient registration and the settling of accounts balance. Through this
project, authorities in St. Kitts and Nevis hope to introduce Taiwans abundant
technology and experience of providing ICT-based health care services to all
public institutions, thereby promoting the digitization and workflow automation
of medical management.
Project appraisal found that the main challenge faced in maintaining or raising
service quality at public hospitals is a lack of rigorous operating procedures
and of a systematic approach toward management, resulting in the ineffective use
of health care resources, and affecting the quality of medical services in turn.
The proportion of manual processes being carried out at the hospital is too
high, increasing the opportunity for errors to arise, and posing serious medical
risks.
In assisting St. Kitts and Nevis to improve the overall quality of health care
at public hospitals, the main components of this project will include: (1)
assisting in reforming procedures at the hospital, introducing Taiwans
experience of medical management; (2) building information systems for a range
of medical services and introducing standard operating processes; and (3)
improving the systems management, maintenance and operational capacity of
technicians sufficient to manage medical management information systems
independently.
Specific project work components will include: (1) analyzing the current status
of hospital operations and conducting business process analysis to provide
diagnostic reports and define gaps in processes, assisting in the integration of
processes by and between each hospital department; (2) building information
systems for a range of medical services, including patient registration,
consultations, accounts, pharmacy operations, storeroom operations, medical
histories, examinations, X-rays, blood bank operations and the management of
pharmaceutical inventories; and (3) training for three system maintenance
personnel so as to support the independent operation of the hospital information
system and eliminate technical obstacles.

Project Objectives: Assist St. Kitts and Nevis authorities in conducting
business process analysis and re-engineering in public hospitals, making overall
improvements to operations, introducing a fully functional hospital information
system and improving overall efficiency, thus enhancing the standard of hospital
services and meeting targets for public satisfaction.

Unqualified people working on JPMC technical posts

SECTION: Vol. 09 No. 239

LENGTH: 374  words


The administration of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC) has made a
nursing attendant in-charge of Main Kitchen on the post of dietician while
several other non-technical people are working on the technical posts in
institution. An official of JPMC told PPI that the hospital administration has
made a non-qualified employee as in-charge of Main Kitchen on the post
dietician. He said although qualified dieticians are available in the hospital
to run its kitchen in a better way but the management has appointed a nursing
attendant as the head of hospital kitchen. He said main responsibilities of a
dietician in public sector hospital are to make diet plan for malnutrition-hit
children, diabetic patients and other patients suffering from various diseases
but unfortunately a non-qualified person has been made in-charge of Kitchen.
Similarly, a leaser technician is working as the head of Operation Theater at
Ophthalmology Department while a dresser of Ward-16 is working as the Personal
Assistant (PA) of the head of department. He said interestingly, a sweeper of
Neurosurgery Department is working as an OT attendant in Neuro Operation
Theater. He said hospital administration is openly violating the rule of merit
and appointing favorite persons on key post despite the fact that qualified
people are present.

He said favoritism is on the peak in the healthcare as incumbent administration
has promoted seven senior medical officers of Grade- 17 to Grade-18 as deputy
directors without getting approval from authorities concerned of health
department of Sindh. Focal Person, JPMC, Dr Jawaid Akhtar Jamali, while talking
to PPI, said due to shortage of qualified people, non-qualified employees are
posted on some technical posts. He said about 900 posts are lying vacant
including professors, doctors, paramedical staff, nurses, pharmacists, nursing
attendants, sweepers and other administrative staff, which has badly affected
the smooth functioning of this major government-run healthcare facility. He said
the management is facing difficulties to run hospital due to the vacant posts.
He informed administration has assigned different responsibilities to some
educated sweepers or nursing attendants on purely temporary basis.

CDA Technical Committee approves three projects including Cardiac Centre at
Capital Hospital: Chairman

LENGTH: 252  words


The meeting of technical committee of Capital Development Authority was held at
CDA Headquarters on Tuesday. Chairman Capital Development Authority Mr. Maroof
Afzal presided over the meeting.

The committee approved three projects including construction of cardiac centre
at Capital Hospital, up-gradation and expansion of operation theatre at CDA
Hospital and matters related to Park Enclave Housing Project as per following
details.

The committee in today's meeting approved the construction of state of the art
cardiac centre at CDA Hospital. The cardiac centre will be constructed at a cost
of Rs. 190 million including cost of machinery, other allied equipment and
staff.

State of the art cardiac centre will be equipped with all latest facilities. It
was informed that CDA spends Rs. 25 million on cardiac patients who are referred
to other hospitals due to non availability of these facilities at CDA hospital.

So after the establishment of this modern cardiac centre CDA would not only save
Rs. 25 million but also earn a handsome amount by treating the non entitled
patients.

During the meeting it was further decided that operation theatre at CDA hospital
would be up-graded, expanded and modernized according to present time needs.

The technical committee in today's meeting also approved in principle to provide
all facilities to the allottees of Park Enclave Housing Project as committed in
the broachers at the time of auction / allotment. The PC-1 for Park Enclave
Housing Project will also be approved soon.

Excitement over new link-up with technical college

HOSPITAL chiefs have hailed a new technical college as 'ground breaking' and
revealed their  excitement over what it could mean for future employment.

Bosses from Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust revealed that it will
be one of several employers sponsoring the new Burton and South Derbyshire
University Technical College (UTC),  which is based in Waterloo Street, Burton.

In a report by Neil Pease, director of workforce management, he  announced that
the trust would be involved in 'curriculum development' and that he was pleased
with the 'clear focus' at the site that was based on securing a workforce for
the trust in the future.

He said: "It is clear that significant work has taken place over the summer,
both in terms of operational input as well and longer-term development work, all
with a clear focus on ensuring that we have a representative, skilled and safe
workforce for the immediate and longer term future of Derby Teaching Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust.

"The development of more formal focused partnerships with Derby College as well
as the Burton UTC will help us to ensure that we have a consistent supply of
staff with the skills we need, in the future.

"It is, however, to be noted that we must now focus on more immediate solutions
to the gaps in our existing workforce and the next report in October 2015, will
focus on workforce supply."

The new technical college, which  is based in new facilities next to Burton Town
Hall, in King Edward Place, was due to open later this month but it has been put
back 12 months due to a lack of students.

It will cater for students aged 14 to 19 who wish to study subjects such as
science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Janak Patel will be principal of the college.

How Queen's check-up became a royal BBC cock-up

BYLINE: Valentine Low

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 652 words


The BBC apologised yesterday after sparking internet rumours that the Queen was
dead. The rumours were started by a tweet from one of its journalists saying
that the Queen was being treated in hospital.

The corporation's embarrassment was compounded when initially it denied -
wrongly - that the journalist had sent out a tweet saying the Queen was dead.

However, the journalist responsible did send out a tweet saying: "Queen
Elizabeth has died."

It was deleted so swiftly that few people picked it up. The tweets were prompted
by a technical rehearsal for the broadcaster's future coverage of the Queen's
death.

In an apparent coincidence that compounded the embarrassment at the BBC, it
emerged soon afterwards that the Queen really had been in hospital for a routine
check-up.

"It is deeply weird," a BBC insider said. "It is like an episode of W1A."

The messages were posted on Twit-ter from the account of Ahmen Khawaja, a BBC
journalist who will now face disciplinary proceedings.

One tweet said: "Breaking: Queen Elizabeth is being treated at King Edward VII
Hospital in London. Statement due shortly."

That tweet was swiftly picked up and repeated by other news organisations,
including CNN and Germany's Bild newspaper. Ms Khawaja, a multimedia journalist
for the BBC's Urdu service, later deleted the tweets, apologising for what she
described as a "false alarm" and giving the impression that the message had been
sent by someone else. She tweeted: "Phone left unattended at home. Silly prank.
Apologies for upsetting anyone!" However, BBC sources suggest that Ms Khawaja
sent out the tweets because she believed that the rehearsal was real. When asked
if Ms Khawaja had also sent a tweet saying the Queen was dead, a BBC spokeswoman
said: "As far as I am aware there was no tweet saying that the Queen was dead."

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "I can confirm that the Queen this morning
attended her annual medical check-up at the King Edward VII's Hospital in
London. This was a routine, prescheduled appointment. The Queen has now left
hospital."

The BBC apologised for the tweet, which it said had been posted in error. It
said in a statement: "During a technical rehearsal for an obituary, tweets were
mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist saying that a member of the
royal family had been taken ill. The tweets were swiftly deleted and we
apologise for any offence."

The BBC regularly conducts technical rehearsals for the death of a member of the
royal family. Access to the rehearsals is tightly controlled, to ensure that
mistakes do not happen.

Two facts remained unexplained last night. The most serious was why the BBC was
able to tweet that the Queen was in hospital when she really was in hospital.
The possibility that the BBC knew she was in hospital seems unlikely. The Times
understands that not even the Buckingham Palace press office knew she was having
a check-up until it looked into the matter. It also seems unlikely that the BBC
decision to hold a technical rehearsal would be linked to the Queen's check-up.

A BBC insider refused to discuss the chain of events, but said: "It was just a
terrible coincidence."

The other unanswered question is why Ms Khawaja, who is not thought to have had
anything to do with the technical rehearsal, got hold of the information that
prompted her tweet - and believed it to be real. The journalist, a media student
until 2013, joined the BBC in April 2014.

The BBC said: "We have nothing further to add at this stage."

Much exaggerated BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth is being treated at King Edward 7th
Hospital in London. Statement due shortly @BBCWORLD "Queen Elizabeth has died"

Serving as an ambassador for career and technical education, Victoria L. Holbert
of Fitchburg, a recent graduate of Montachusett Regional Vocational Technical
School, was selected to join a group of national student leaders meeting
recently with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Assistant Secretary
Brenda Dann-Messier in Washington, D.C.

The purpose of the meeting was to speak in support of the proposed
reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, a
federal grant that supports career and technical schools throughout the country.

Miss Holbert, who is finishing her one-year stint as national president of
Skil-lsUSA, traveled to Washington for the meeting, accompanied by Karen E.
Ward, executive director of SkillsUSA Massachusetts.

Ms. Ward had high praise for the teen's presentation. "Victoria did a
spectacular job. She was well versed, articulate and on point. She drew praise
from Assistant Secretary Dann-Messier for how well prepared she was and for the
quality of her comments," she said.

She added that Mr. Duncan acknowledged Victoria's "thoughts on the issues of
concern within the bill."

"Victoria represented Montachusett Regional and Massachusetts career and
technical education in terrific fashion. It was amazing to see," Ms. Ward said.

Miss Holbert was awarded a full, four-year scholarship from the Naval Reserve
Officers' Training Corps to study political science this fall at Norwich
University in Northfield, Vt.

HealthAlliance Hospital recently hosted an Open House and Survivor's Day
Celebration at the newly renovated and expanded Simonds-Sinon Regional Cancer
Center in Fitchburg. The event brought together more than 200 community members
who wished to show their support for the battle against cancer.

The celebration honored cancer survivors, as well as the contributors to The
Capital Campaign for the cancer center.

Speakers included HealthAlliance Hospital President and CEO Patrick Muldoon,
Capital Campaign co-chairman John Clementi, American Cancer Society Area
Director of Health Initiatives Nanyamka Hales and Simonds-Sinon Regional Cancer
Center Medical Director Dr. Madhavi Toke.

Mr. Muldoon opened the program by acknowledging the survivors, donors, staff and
community members who gathered at the event. "Your attendance is a true measure
of your commitment to fighting the battle against cancer and to our cancer
center. Our new cancer center and patient-centered care programs are here for
everyone in our community and in our region: our survivors, our fighters, our
winners, our warriors and our champions."

A video was shown depicting both patient and employee testimonials of the cancer
center. The patients gave accounts of their personal experiences with the
disease, and the cancer center employees discussed their dedication to providing
care. The video may be viewed at www.youtube.com/everybodydeserves.

The Capital Campaign has raised more than $2.5 million or 65 percent of the
campaign's goal for the cancer center. An additional $1.45 million is needed to
reach the total $4 million dollar goal.

Dr. Mary M. Chiavaras, assistant professor of radiology at McMaster University,
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and musculoskeletal radiologist at Hamilton General
Hospital, has been awarded a one-year, $40,000 research seed grant from the
Radiological Society of North America Research and Education Foundation.

Originally from Lunenburg, Dr. Chiavaras received her medical degree at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester and her Ph.D. from
McGill University in Montreal. She now lives in Ancaster, Ontario, with her
husband and three children.

Brittany Champa, Caitlin Coleman, Ramneek Hoonjan and Jessica Lynch of
Fitchburg, Michael Carpentier of Gardner, Bryana Boudreau, Brian Cosimi, Sophia
El-Hayek, Katie Mazzeo and Anthony Sacino of Leominster, and Shannon Sweitzer of

After swachh survey, govt to rank its hosps

SECTION: BHOPAL

LENGTH: 395 words


Bhopal: After swachh ranking of cities and railway station, it's the turn of
government run-hospitals. Madhya Pradesh health department is gearing for a
survey and ranking of its hospitals.To begin with, four hospitals would be
surveyed to complete the national quality assurance standards (NQAS)
adherence.On June 1, the first of the assessment would be carried out at
Bhopal's JP hospital.Hectic activity is on at the hospital for the past week to
improve in sanitation. Other hospitals in MP that have been motivated to take
the test are -- district hospital Bhind, Satna, Icchawar and maternal health
facility in Jabalpur.NQAS has two components.

One is based on technical quality on which, usually service providers (doctors,
nurses and para-medical staff) are more concerned and has a bearing on outcome
or end-result of services delivered. Second is the service quality that pertains
to those aspects of facility based care and services, which patients are often
more concerned, and has bearing on patient satisfaction."Experts will evaluate
preparedness of JP hospital. Other hospitals administration has also been
invited. It is a handholding exercise with experts. Once they determine the
shortcomings, we will improve it ahead of NQAS," said national health mission
(NHM) joint director Dr Pankaj Shukla.Indications are that health centres like
district JP hospital will focus on improving processes and outcome. Many of
these hospitals lack the required infrastructure and are short of doctors and
other paramedical staff.The problem plagues much of the Madhya Pradesh health
sector. NQAS has been implemented in various other states over the last two
years. MP health department has been less than optimistic in getting its
hospitals and facilities evacuated, said sources. The inspection at JP hospital
would take place on Thursday. Results from the evaluation would be known within
a week. The team will also visit Satna and Bhind. BOXREALITY CHECKHospitals are
focussing on 'service quality' over 'technical quality'Most hospitals are short
staffed and lack modern infrastructure Technical Quality - Will be assessed by
clinical protocols, infection control, emergency responseService Quality - To be
assessed by service delivery and client satisfaction, privacy and dignity,
hygiene and cleanliness, and behaviour of staff

+ EDITOR'S NOTE: Due to a production error, the following items either missed
running or were not run in their entirety in Sunday's Hometown Citrus pages.

Three Citrus Memorial Hospital employees were among the first graduating class
from Withlacoochee Technical Institute's evening Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN)
course under the state-sponsored Nurses Now grant. Graduation took place on Feb.
26.

Janice Fulton and Melissa Slaght of Homosassa and Sherrie Kaneshige of Beverly
Hills worked full-time during the day, attended class three nights each week,
and did their clinical work every other weekend during the 18-month program.
WTI's other LPN courses, lasting 10 months, do not include night or weekend
work.

All three will be transferring as LPNs to into nursing units from their former
assignments: Fulton was in the insurance office, Slaght was in the lab and
Kaneshige was a patient care tech.

"The Nurses Now grant provided funding for the program's tuition, with Citrus
Memorial Hospital picking up the remainder for us," said Fulton. "Our uniforms
and books were also paid through CMH and the grant. We did not have to pay out
of our pockets for any of the essentials. Our whole class is proud of ourselves
because of how hard we worked," she said.

The hospital is also proud of the group.

"We were delighted to have employees in this program," said Chief Nursing
Officer Pam Moore. "We are always looking for ways to support the nursing
profession and increase our resources here at CMH, and "growing our own' is a
great way to do it."

Shirley Dibble and Liz Huxley, both registered nurses at Seven Rivers Regional
Medical Center, became Safe Sitter Instructors on March 11. They attended a
workshop in Tampa and are now qualified to teach the nationally recognized Safe
Sitter babysitting training program.

Safe Sitter is a medically accurate program that teaches 11 to 13 year-olds how
to be safe, nurturing babysitters. The goal of Safe Sitter is to reduce the
number of avoidable and unintentional injuries or deaths among children being
cared for by babysitters.

Over 350,000 young adolescents across the country have been trained by Safe
Sitter to handle life-threatening emergencies. Students get hands-on practice in
basic lifesaving techniques so they are prepared to act in a crisis. They learn
safety and security precautions, such as what to do if a stranger comes to the
door. They learn basic child development as well as the business aspects of
babysitting.

To successfully complete the Safe Sitter program, students must pass a rigorous
practical and written test to show that they have mastered the key concepts and
have the skills necessary to handle an emergency.

Seven Rivers Regional will host its first Safe Sitter program in May.

coordinator, at 352-795-8344.

Has it been 103 years? That's a big question for Inverness resident Velma
Anderson, who turns 103 today.

"How did I get here," exclaimed Anderson. "Am I really 103 years old?"

Yes, Velma, you are. And you've had a lifetime of wonderful adventures to prove
it.

Born Velma Estella Butler on April 4, 1902, in Galton, Pa., her family later
moved to Elmira, N.Y., where she met and married Harry Anderson in 1923.

In May 1970 the couple moved to Inverness. Mr. Anderson passed away in November
1997 after more than 72 years of marriage.

The couple had three sons and four daughters, all but one born at home. Son
Glenn Anderson of California has survived his two brothers, Walter and Arthur.
The four daughters are Joyce Tallbee of Elmira, N.Y.; Lois Anderson, who is Mrs.
Anderson's caretaker and lives with her; Betty Anderson, of Inverness and Mary
Jastrzebski, of Ocala.

Not only did Anderson give birth to seven children of her own, she opened her
home to numerous foster children over a 16 year period.

"I had about 100 foster children," explained Anderson.

She also enjoys crocheting and working jigsaw puzzles.

But more than anything she loves to sing her hymns accompanied by the piano.
Appropriately, for a person of such a sunny demeanor, her favorite hymn is There
is Sunshine in My Soul Today.

NGO takes up HIV+ outreach worker's cause

BYLINE: Aditi Gyanesh

SECTION: LUDHIANA

LENGTH: 572 words


LUDHIANA: One of the nine outreach workers designated in Ludhiana at an ICTC
(Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre) alleged that Dr US Sooch - project
officer (Ludhiana), AIDS Control - disclosed her identity in a discriminatory
statement to the media on January 31. This issue was brought up by an NGO -
Punjab Networking of Positive People Society - actively working against the
discrimination with HIV positive people, and for the rights of the affected
people, and awareness of AIDS.

On behalf of the outreach workers opposing this 'insensitive' step of Dr Sooch,
the NGO has written letters to Punjab health minister Surjit Kumar Jiyani,
Punjab State Human Rights Commission, and the National AIDS Control Society.
They will be submitting a memorandum to deputy commissioner of Ludhiana, Rajat
Aggarwal, on Monday, demanding legal action against Dr Sooch, and an inquiry
into the whole case. Meanwhile, Sooch has denied giving the statement. "I have
given no such statement anywhere. I know the rules, and I also know that if I do
not follow them, no one else will," he emphasized.

President of the NGO, Jagjit Singh Mann, while talking to ToI, said: "When it
comes to keeping the identity of the HIV positive patient confidential, there
are very minute things on which people need to focus, otherwise it can lead to
discrimination against them in society. Keeping in mind the guidelines, some
outreach workers or their family members are supposed to be HIV positive
patients. If Dr Sooch knew that the identity of the HIV positive outreach worker
was being discussed openly, then he should have been taken care to conceal it.
However, until now, none of the staff working with the outreach worker knew that
she was HIV positive. But after this disclosure, she is under threat of
discrimination at her workplace, and also where she lives."

The NGO also brought to light that there is shortage of technical staff in
Ludhiana at many places for the past one year, but there have been no
appointments made by the district AIDS control society.

Non-technical staff doing HIV tests in CMCH

According to present information, both the posts of lab technicians at the ICTC
of the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Ludhiana, are lying vacant
for about a year, and the lives of patients getting HIV tests done have been put
at stake with non-technical staff doing the tests.

It is to be noted that there are nine ICTCs in Ludhiana district - five of them
in the villages of Payal, Khanna, Jagraon, Raikot, and Samrala; and four of them
in the city at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Civil Hospital, and
two at the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). According to the
guidelines of the National AIDS Control Society (NACO), there should be a
counsellor, a lab technician, and an outreach worker at an ICTC, who can then
refer the HIV positive patient to an ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centre in the
city for treatment.

NGO head Mann said: "As the lab technician is not available, other non-technical
staff are asked to perform the task of technical staff. How can we depend on
such lax AIDS control services in the city? The condition is the same at some
other ICTCs also, where lab technicians are available." When Sooch was
questioned about this, he told ToI: "We are looking for lab technicians for the
two ICTCs at CMCH. Very soon, the appointments will be made."

                             May 12, 2016 Thursday

College plan can help with health of care

SECTION: SPORT:OTHER; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 504  words


A BID for a technical college to address a shortage of nurses in the county is
expected to be lodged with the government by this autumn.

Gloucester MP Richard Graham has highlighted the city's interest in a pilot
project that could see 1,000 new nursing associates trained.

The new role would be an alternative route to become a registered nurse,
bridging the gap between healthcare support workers, who have a care
certificate, and registered nurses with degrees.

The University of Gloucestershire is working with Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust to launch the bid for a University Technical College.

If the bid is successful, the aim will be to welcome the first intake of
students in September 2019.

Associate Nurses would study at universities with university technical colleges
essentially acting as secondary schools and can involve undertaking more
vocational qualifications.

Mr Graham, inset, said: "I've no doubt that if our university is approved to
offer pre-registration courses, and then run a major pilot scheme for Nursing
Associates in Gloucestershire, that would make a huge difference to the current
shortage of nurses in both city and county.

"Degrees aren't for everyone, so this higher apprenticeship will give everyone
the opportunity to get a qualification and work in the health sector, which is
our biggest employer in Gloucester."

NHS hospitals in Gloucestershire have launched drives to recruit new nurses.

The technical college plans come after the Government scrapped bursaries for
student nurses and midwives in England from 2017, who will have to apply for
loans.

University of Gloucestershire vice-chancellor Stephen Marston, , said: "Given
the importance of the health service, we are keen to work with the Hospitals
Trust and other NHS partners to help ensure they can recruit the staff they need
to provide excellent patient care.

"A technical college could provide a great way of enabling 14-18 year olds to
gain both an excellent education and a wider experience."

The role of nursing associates was created last year to bridge the gap between
registered nurses and senior healthcare assistants.

They will provide hands-on care, allowing nurses to spend more time on their
clinical duties.

They would be trained through on-the-job experience via an apprenticeship,
leading to a foundation degree.

A survey by the public service union Unison last year showed nine in 10 student
nurses would not have applied for a nursing degree without bursaries available.

A spokesperson for Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: "This is
an exciting and encouraging opportunity particularly for the young people of
Gloucestershire who in the future could be offered the chance of studying and
training locally with the prospect of full-time employment and a career in
healthcare at one of our two hospitals in Gloucester and Cheltenham.

"The national shortage of key healthcare professionals has been well documented.
This development has the potential to help address some of these issues."

According to a handout on Thursday, the principal in a statement said all kinds
of tests would be conducted in central lab now wherein doctors have better
facilities for research.

The central lab would be connected to all the wards and theatres in the second
phase of this project so that every doctor could watch lab reports on his or her
computer online. He said it would reduce the problems of attendants and the
culture of handwritten reports would also end.

The principal said PCR, DNA/RNA Extraction System Microarray, Total solution for
microbiology, Hematology, Histopathology, Chemical Pathology and Stem Cell can
now be examined in the upgraded lab. He said provision of best available medical
facilities to patients is the mission of LGH administration which can be well
served by a modern and well equipped test lab.

He said today is the age of research and only those nations are progressing
rapidly that are focused on research. He also PGMI is spending Rs 10 million in
the head of research annually and young doctors must utilise this facility at
the maximum as they posses best talent and capability to shine in the
profession.

Tevta: Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) Chairman
Irfan Qaiser Sheikh has claimed that an increase of 300 percent has been
observed in the enrolment of students in technical courses being offered by
Tevta.

Addressing a meeting of Tevta officials here on Thursday, Irfan Qaiser Sheikh
also observed that during last two and half years, there was massive increase in
the enrolment of students in courses of technical and vocational education at
Tevta institutes across the Punjab. He added when he took charge of the
Authority, there were only 60,000 to 65,000 students enrolled in these courses;
however, the number now has been increased up to 190,000. 'This increase is
around 300 percent which is record enrolment since the inception of Tevta', he
added.

He said our first target was to win the trust of parents and we had been
successful in this regard.

Another reason for increase in the enrolment was the demand-driven courses being
offered by Tevta as it started several courses which were the need of the market
and the industry, he added.

Emphasising the need of technical education, Tevta chairman explained that
reason behind Japan's major development was technical and vocational education.
Skilled people always play their vital role in the economic development of any
country, he said and added taking this concept on board, Tevta was offering
latest and updated courses for the students and will continue to add more
courses in the context of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Nursing that ambition

NURSING AWARDS

Courage, discipline and dedication are still the qualities that drive today's
Florence Nightingales

NURSES' DAY here came into its own this year with the inaugural President's
Award for excellence in nursing.

More than 350 dedicated nurses with outstanding service records were nominated
for the new accolade, but the Ministry Of Health shortlisted only seven for the
final round.

At the end of all that, three women -- Ms Catherine Chua of Woodbridge Hospital,
Ms Cher Sok Kew of KK Women's & Children's Hospital and Ms Tan Wee King of the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE) -- were saluted for their exemplary
contributions to health care in Singapore, and then feted at the Istana at an
awards ceremony on Tuesday, graced by President S. R. Nathan.

In separate interviews with Life! on Wednesday and Thursday, the three nurses
cited their supportive families as being instrumental in enabling them to pursue
their calling.

For theirs is a battle fraught mostly with emotional lows, waged daily as it is
with such non-negotiables as pain and disease.

Their only weapon? Courage of a quieter, deeper kind, the sort, says Ms Chua,
52, that steels latter-day Florence Nightingales to accept that a now-empty bed,
which had just recently been allocated, may mean that the patient has either
been discharged or deceased.

Ms Tan, 45, who teaches the National Certificate of Nursing course at ITE Bishan
says: "It is generally recognised that the rigorous discipline expected in
nursing is second only to that in the military."

The drop-out rate for the course she teaches used to be 50 per cent, she says.
But since the school of nursing moved from Outram Road to ITE in January this
year, more students have signed up to do nursing as an alternative course
subject.

The larger available pool of applicants, says Ms Tan, means that she is able to
select only those whom she thinks can make the final grade.

Thus far, the school's January 2000 student intake stood at 68 (dwindling later
to 62) and the July 2000 intake is holding firm.

Says Ms Tan: "We are so short of nurses in Singapore that the opening of many
new hospital wards is being held back till they recruit suitably-trained
nurses."

She adds: "Health-care planners should rope experienced nurses into their
discussions because it is the nurses who, after all, know best what makes a ward
tick and why."

NHTC all set to launch diploma course on BEE

BYLINE: HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE

LENGTH: 481  words


KATHMANDU: National Health Training Centre under the Ministry of Health and
Population is all set to begin a new diploma course on biomedical equipment
engineering in the country, .

The 18-month diploma in biomedical equipment engineering course will be run
under the academic authority of the Council for Technical Education and
Vocational Training. This will be first academic course on this subject in the
country. As many as 24 students have been selected for the year 2015-16. Various
three-month and eight-month trainings were conducted by NHTC to produce
biomedical technicians on this subject since 2005 and 138 technicians have been
produced so far.

MoHP will be launching the course amid a function on Sunday.

Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, Director at NHTC, said, "If all necessary services are
not available in one hospital, it refers patients to another hospital. But if
services cannot be provided due to technical problems in equipment, it is even
more difficult as medical equipment are not available everywhere. Even for minor
repair of equipment in rural areas we need to call technicians from urban
centres, which has been affecting patients."

"If we become capable of producing more capable and professional human
resources, patients in the rural areas will not have to face problems as the
technicians will deal with the equipment," he added.

Shrestha also stressed that detection, prevention, treatment as well as control
of health-related problems were entirely dependent on equipment in today's
world. "Delivery of health service will be badly affected when technical
problems occur," he added.

According to National Health Training Centre, various studies have shown that
more than 40 per cent of the equipment have not been installed in health
facilities in proper manner and users do not take preventive measures while
using the equipment. In some hospitals the equipment remain unused for a long
period of time once they face minor problems, said NHTC, adding hospitals and
users are not aware about the right use of the equipment because of which they
get damaged and remain unutilised.

Human resources produced from diploma in biomedical equipment engineering course
will be appointed as biomedical equipment technician. Till date, no government
posts have been created for BMET.

The Ministry of Health and Population and National Health Training Centre are to
hold discussions with the concerned bodies to create permanent position of BMET
in hospitals. BMET is a key person who takes care of equipment and instruments
used to diagnose and treat disease in a hospital.

According to NHTC, only 10 per cent of the equipment are fully functioning at
central hospitals, 39 per cent at regional/zonal hospitals and 30 per cent at
district hospitals. It stated that the country currently needs 11 biomedical
engineers, 143 BMET and 285 biomedical equipment assistant technicians.

CGTC, CSH partner for literacy, education programs

BYLINE: Alexander Cain, The Union-Recorder, Milledgeville, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 789 words


Sep. 11--The Milledgeville campus of Central Georgia Technical College and the
Central State Hospital campus are more than 10 miles away from each other -- but
a newly-formed partnership between the two will bring them closer together than
ever.

Located on the southside of Milledgeville, Central State, one of Baldwin
County's largest employers, and Central Georgia Technical College, located more
to the north of Milledgeville near the Highway 22/212 intersection, have come
together to provide additional opportunities for those in the Baldwin County and
Central Georgia area to access literacy and adult education classes.

"It seemed like there was a lack of literacy service in this area," Demetrice
Bryant, director of staff development and training for Central State Hospital,
said. "Now, if someone wants GED services they can come here."

CSH and CGTC have modified a former storage area in the Yarbrough Building on
the CSH property, turning the space into a classroom that will be used to teach
central Georgians in Adult Basic and Adult Secondary Education -- essentially,
literacy classes that will assist with earning a General Education Development
diploma, or GED, or to assist its current employees who have previous nursing
training in continuing and expanding upon those skills.

Basically, it means that if someone can't make it to the CGTC campus, or someone
is looking to improve and find a better job in Baldwin County, Central State
Hospital now has facilities on the property that can help.

And it's all free to the public, according to Sallie Devero, dean of the Adult
Education Program with Central Georgia Technical College.

"This is our partnership with Central State Hospital to provide adult education
classes to Baldwin County. Classes will begin October 1, and we are currently in
the initial phases of getting people oriented. People who attend the classes are
people who need to earn their GEDs, or build up skills or brush up on their
current skills to pass entrance exams," Devero explained.

Kimberly Boyer is employed as a team leader in the Central State Hospital
Housekeeping Division.

Boyer was among the nearly 100 CSH employees who visited an informational table
set up outside the Yarbrough Building Wednesday as part of a ribbon cutting
ceremony marking the partnership between the two entities.

"I'm looking into CNA and LPN orientation. I've got a lot of interest in the
field, and I really enjoy helping people. It all sounds like a good program,"
Boyer said.

A program that could have long-lasting benefits in Baldwin County, which already
has programs in place to increase its overall literacy rate and improve in areas
such as employment, graduation rates and overall job performances in its
industrial sector.

"A great number of Central State Hospital employees want to finish their
education but may have been out of school for a long period of time, and that
can be intimidating. We do train or provide certified services for CNAs here,
and those are usually free," Devero said.

Kenneth Daniels is an adjunct instructor for the Baldwin County Adult Education
Program run through CGTC, and was present for Wednesday's ribbon cutting
ceremony that introduced potential students to the new classroom at CSH.

"I'm an instructional coordinator, which means I help to train the teachers,"
Daniels said. "Most of what I do is make sure that the classroom is adequate,
supplied with software and I make sure that the teachers are in compliance for
adult education through the Technical College System of Georgia. I think what
they're doing here is a great idea. The expansion into the community is a great
benefit for the program."

For more information on the Baldwin County Adult Education Program or
information on the partnership between Central Georgia Technical College and
Central State Hospital, contact the CSH Staff Development & Training Department
at (478) 445-4425 or the CGTC Baldwin Campus at (478) 445-2230.

"We were looking at a way to serve our employees, but then it grew to looking at
ways to serve the community as well. We're hoping to get the community involved
through orientations and assessments held on campus. This is in part to help
find a way to work with individuals who need the services and couldn't get to
town. We're willing to work with anyone," Devero said.

The military medical system

BYLINE: Mac Savage, Vancouver Province

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A21

LENGTH: 307  words


Sara MacIntyre makes the following statement: "For example, members of the
Canadian Forces and the RCMP are not restricted to the public [health care]
system."

This is misleading, at least in the case of the military, which has its own
separate health care system! During my 36 years in the military, each base (camp
or station) had its own hospital staffed by military doctors, military nurses
and military technical support personnel who were also "deployed" when required.

About 10 to 15 years ago, base hospitals were closed and the place of employment
of the military medical personnel was moved to local hospitals. These military
medical personnel were integrated into civilian hospitals for general employment
and treat patients, with the clear commitment by the hospital that the treatment
of any military personnel took priority. While this was undoubtedly forced upon
the military by the financial cuts of successive federal governments, it is a
win-win situation for both sides.

The military pays to educate and train its doctors, nurses and technical support
personnel, thus it is not only logical but also right and proper that military
personnel are in a separate queue at those hospitals where this arrangement
exists. If they are referred to a private clinic, the same argument holds true.

The military has a constant and continuing external-to-Canada requirement for
military doctors, nurses and medical technicians for six-month (or longer)
deployments to foreign locations where medicine is not their only concern. They
could be with the navy in the Gulf, for example. Not many civilian practitioners
queue up to volunteer for these dangerous UN missions.

It cannot be the RCMP and the military who are providing the bulk of the
patients to private clinics. One is left with Workers Compensation Board
patients.

Hospital insists it is 'fire-safe'

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 255 words


Health board bosses have reassured anyone using the Queen Elizabeth University
Hospital that it is"one of the most fire-safe buildings in the country".

The move to boost public reassurance comes after NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde
brought in external technical advisers to give advice on fire safety.

This follows concerns arising about external cladding as a result of the
GrenfellTower fire in London that killed around 80 people in June.

A health board spokeswoman said:"As part of these further forensic checks, we
have identified a type of aluminium composite material on parts of the Queen
Elizabeth University Hospital of a similar type to, but not the same as,
Grenfell.

"Health Facilities Scotland and their national fire advisor have given us
renewed assurances that the hospital is an extremely safe building.

"The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has also provided further reassurance
that, as part of its regular risk based audit programme, it had carried out fire
safety audits within the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, which were found
to be satisfactory.

"As a purely precautionary measure, and to make sure the public, our patients
and our staff have full confidence in the safety of the hospital we have taken
the decision to remove the panels from the areas of the hospital affected.

"The panels that will be removed are present in three external sections of the
building and we are currently working with contractors and technical advisers to
assess how this work can proceed at the earliest possible opportunity."

organizations that are willing to contribute to projects, at "zero cost" and
assume the responsibility to share their knowledge, experience and best
practices. In this sense, there has been a strategic alliance with the Hospital
General de Medellín, Luz Castro de Gutiérrez E.S.E of Colombia, a high
complexity public hospital, which features renowned national and international
level.To take advantage of the knowledge of the Hospital General de Medellín,
the Minister of Finance, in his capacity of Governor of the Republic of
Guatemala to the IDB, has requested the Bank a non-reimbursable intra-regional
technical cooperation to provide financing to a mission of four officials who
will travel to Colombia in order to understanding in detail the operation of the
Medellín hospital and take the best practices that can be implemented at

Pakistan: Three-day national workshop on patient safety starts in PIMS

LENGTH: 433  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, June 02 -- A three-day national workshop on

expansion of Patient Safety Friendly Hospital Initiative (PSFHI)

commenced at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on

Monday.

Addressing the opening session of the workshop, Secretary

Health Khushnood Akhtar Lashari said the workshop had been organized

with an aim to raise awareness and capacity development of

clinicians, hospital staff and managers in the implementation of

the PSFHI.

He said the overall objective of PSFHI implementation in

Pakistan is to strive for accreditation with an internationally

acknowledged hospital standard and achieve the ultimate aim of

patient safety, trust and satisfaction in the health care system.

He said Patient Safety Centre in PIMS will serve to establish

its leadership role in the field of quality and safety in health

care. It is envisaged to act as a hub of PSFHI activities in

Pakistan through implementation of the standard protocols, he added.

He said it will also serve as a training and resource centre

to improve quality and safety of care in other tertiary and

secondary health care hospitals across the country.

Country head of World Health Organization (WHO) Dr. Khalif Bile

said that patient safety is a WHO strategy in which member states

are urged to develop national standards for patient safety, making

use of WHO technical guiding documents.

He added member states have been asked to formulate national

patient safety programmes in collaboration with the Regional Office

and the World Alliance for Patient Safety besides establishing

mechanisms to promote partnership between regional patient safety

institutions and national health care delivery systems.

He said Patient Safety Friendly Hospital Initiative aimed at

instigating and encouraging safe health practices in hospitals and

involves the implementation of a set of patient safety standards

in health institutions.

He said the patient safety initiative covers a wide array of

areas including leadership and management measures, patient and

public involvement measures, safe evidence based clinical practices

measures, safe environment measures and lifelong learning measures.

He added the major steps involved in the process included

assessment of current level of patient safety in the hospitals,

provision of technical assistance for improving the level of patient

safety, follow-up assessment to demonstrate improvement and

technical assistance to develop a national safety progra Published by HT

Clinic gives High Point doctors

BYLINE: AMELIA DAVIS

SECTION: NORTH PINELLAS TIMES; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 1027 words

DATELINE: LARGO



A medical clinic staffed by three physicians, a registered nurse and a
full-time receptionist opened this week in the High Point community.

The clinic, which will provide basic family care, means most residents will  be
within walking distance of a primary care facility.

"Our community has needed this for so long," said Fran Lever, a member of  High
Point Community Pride. "So many of our residents don't have  transportation."

The clinic, on the campus of the Pinellas Technical Education Center, is a
joint project of the Pinellas County school district and health department,  Sun
Coast Hospital and the Suncoast Family YMCAs.

Don Bitting, assistant PTEC director, said it is on the north side of the
campus in Building 17. The technical school is at 6100 154th Ave. N.

In addition to serving residents in the High Point neighborhood, staff  members
and their families at High Point Elementary and PTEC will use the  clinic,
Bitting said.

"We are so proud of this because it is a really nice facility," Bitting  said.
"We believe it will help us build a stronger partnership with the High  Point
community."

Ken Kniaz, director of clinic services for Sun Coast, said the hospital is
pleased to offer medical services within the High Point neighborhood, which is
between Ulmerton Road and Roosevelt Boulevard just east of Largo.

The High Point clinic is the hospital's fourth and the farthest from the  main
facility, an osteopathic hospital on Indian Rocks Road.

Clinic patients with special needs will be referred to Sun Coast  specialists,
Kniaz said.

Rotating doctors on staff at the High Point Clinic are Pamela Karasy,  Gregory
James and Larry Bunnell. Together, the three osteopathic physicians  have more
than 40 years of experience.

Mary Ponshock, a member of High Point Neighbors, said she has heard rumors
about the clinic and believes it will be a welcome addition to the
neighborhood.

"Now, I have to go quite a ways to go to the doctor," Ponshock said.

For the time being, clinic hours are from 1 to 5 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays  and
Fridays and from 8:30 a.m. to noon Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Kniaz said he hopes hours can be expanded once residents discover the  clinic
and begin to use it regularly.

"We are handing out fliers at the schools and in the mobile home parks,"  Kniaz
said. "Our goal is to have this explode in the community."

He said the clinic will accept patients on almost all insurance plans and  offer
sliding scale fees depending on annual family income to those without
insurance.

Residents are welcome to stop by to see the facility, he said.

Clinic gives High Point community its own doctors

SECTION: SEMINOLE TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 441 words

DATELINE: LARGO



A medical clinic staffed by three physicians, a registered nurse and a
full-time receptionist opened this week in the High Point community.

The clinic, which will provide basic family care, means most residents will  be
within walking distance of a primary care facility.

"Our community has needed this for so long," said Fran Lever, a member of  High
Point Community Pride. "So many of our residents don't have  transportation."

The clinic, on the campus of the Pinellas Technical Education Center, is a
joint project of the Pinellas County school district and health department,  Sun
Coast Hospital and the Suncoast Family YMCAs.

Don Bitting, assistant PTEC director, said it is on the north side of the
campus in Building 17. The technical school is at 6100 154th Ave. N.

In addition to serving residents in the High Point neighborhood, staff  members
and their families at High Point Elementary and PTEC will use the  clinic,
Bitting said.

"We are so proud of this because it is a really nice facility," Bitting  said.
"We believe it will help us build a stronger partnership with the High  Point
community."

Ken Kniaz, director of clinic services for Sun Coast, said the hospital is
pleased to offer medical services within the High Point neighborhood, which is
between Ulmerton Road and Roosevelt Boulevard just east of Largo.

The High Point clinic is the hospital's fourth and the farthest from the  main
facility, an osteopathic hospital on Indian Rocks Road. Clinic patients  with
special needs will be referred to Sun Coast specialists, Kniaz said.  Rotating
doctors on staff at the High Point Clinic are Pamela Karasy, Gregory  James, and
Larry Bunnell. Together, the three osteopathic physicians have more  than 40
years of experience.

Mary Ponshock, a member of High Point Neighbors, said she has heard rumors
about the clinic and believes it will be a welcome addition to the
neighborhood.

"Now, I have to go quite a ways to go to the doctor," Ponshock said.

For the time being, clinic hours are 1 to 5 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays and from 8:30 a.m. to noon Tuesdays and Thursdays. Kniaz said he hopes
hours can be expanded once residents discover the clinic and begin to use it
regularly.

"We are handing out fliers at the schools and in the mobile home parks,"  Kniaz
said. "Our goal is to have this explode in the community."

He said the clinic will accept patients on almost all insurance plans and  offer
sliding scale fees depending on annual family income to those without
insurance. Residents are welcome to stop by to see the facility, he said.

Colleges turning to lotteries for cash

BYLINE: ANDY MARSHALL

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B5

NAIT, SAIT hope to raise $ 1 million each for programs

Alberta's two technical colleges are launching a multi-million-dollar gamble
they hope will raise up to $ 1 million each for some of their programs.

Two homes in Calgary and Edmonton, valued at about $ 450,000 each, plus major
cash prizes are being offered by the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology
and its sister institute in Edmonton to support "continuing educational
excellence in technical training".

"We have more need for expenditures on equipment than we can otherwise meet in
the budget," SAIT board of governors chairman Bruce Libin said Wednesday. SAIT's
1995-96 budget was set at $ 93 million.

But, he also said raising money was only a third priority in the lottery
campaign which will include a mass mail-out to one million Alberta homes.

"This is an excellent opportunity to publicize technical training," he said. It
is also a chance to form a partnership with NAIT, and "demonstrate how we can
work together."

More details will be announced at a news conference today, but this is believed
to be the first-ever effort by post-secondary institutions to make money in this
way.

The lottery format is based on successful campaigns by the Alberta Children's
Hospital and the Foothills Hospital to make money for equipment to boost patient
care by selling $ 100 lottery tickets.

Another major lottery last year raised funds for a police patrol helicopter, and
three schools in Cochrane made more than $ 200,000 through a big-prize draw.

It is understood that five areas in the institutions have been identified for
help with the hoped-for lottery proceeds. The money will be used to buy or
upgrade equipment, or for new facilities.

Libin said he had no trouble with the idea of gambling proceeds supporting
technical education.

The lottery campaign will be in addition to SAIT's $ 3-million, community
fund-raising program.

A proposal to the board earlier this year suggested SAIT and NAIT could expect
to recoup at least $ 1 million from a $ 2.5-million lottery.

Despite the proliferation of lotteries in Alberta, a provincial gaming
consultant said "the market is not saturated, there is room for lotteries with
good prizes, and well-priced tickets."

SAIT and NAIT will own the lottery, to be run by a professional lottery manager.

Mount Royal College spokesman Hunter Wight said the lottery business was
attracting lots of success, but the college has never considered doing anything
similar.

Nursing, HA colleges press to scrap deal

BYLINE: Himalayan News Service

LENGTH: 324  words


KATHMANDU: The Forum for Health and Technical Sciences today urged the Council
for Technical Education and Vocational Training to scrap

the agreement reached in the past and allow admissions in the Proficiency
Certificate Level in Nursing and Health Assistant.

CTEVT and nursing college owners had reached an agreement in August 7, 2007 that
any nursing college

affiliated with CTEVT could coordinate with other hospitals for students'
practical classes till they finish

constructing their own 50-bed hospital.

The agreement has it that every nursing college should have its own hospital
within two years of signing the agreement and that the hospital should be in
operation by mid-July 2009. But, most of the colleges could not fulfill the
commitment, thereby resulting in the halt of admission for PCL staff nurse and
Health Assistance/ general medicine this year.

Representatives from FHTS demanded scrapping of the agreement citing hospital
construction was an expensive business.

"CTEVT needs to scrap the 2007 agreement because it was erroneous," said
Khagendra Adhikari, general secretary, FHTS. "With admissions halted, 1,640
students have been deprived of pursuing their staff nurse and HA/ general
medicine course."

According to Adhikari, CTEVT had halted admissions in 21 colleges with staff
nurse programme and 20 colleges with HA programme.

Other speakers stated that they were ready to coordinate with the government to
strengthen primary health centres and districts hospitals instead of
constructing own hospitals because it was costly.

In case government failed to listen to them and did not scrap the earlier
agreement, they would be forced to come to streets, they said.

Dr Devi Ghimire, vice chairperson, CTEVT said that he was positive about their
demands. "The private sector should be encouraged by allowing them to open
admissions on PCL in nursing but as it is sub-judice now, I cannot speak
anything on behalf of CTEVT," he said.

MAN IS HELD AFTER KNIFE ATTACK ON OAP

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 157 words


A PENSIONER is recovering in hospital after being stabbed in the back on a
Coventry street corner.

He was attacked at the junction of Gordon Street and Butts, near Coventry
Technical College, at 5.15pm yesterday.

The injured man, who is 66, has not been named.

His condition in Walsgrave Hospital today is described as stable.

Police say the pensioner was stabbed once in the back.

Paramedics called to the scene were initially so concerned about the man's
condition they alerted doctors and nurses at Walsgrave to be on standby.

Insp Kevin Kelsey said: "At one stage we were quite concerned about him, but he
is now comfortable on the ward."

A police spokesman confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping
inquiries.

He is being interviewed by officers at Chace Avenue Police Station.

Police are appealing for witnesses and have asked anyone who saw anything to
call them on 024 7653 9040.

3-MONTH CHILD HAS BRAIN BUG

BYLINE: Lynne Kelleher

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 217 words


A TINY child is battling the deadly brain bug meningitis - 24 hours after a
college student died from the disease in the same hospital.

The three-month-old baby was rushed to hospital in Portlaoise over the weekend
with suspected meningococcal meningitis.

The child was brought into the hospital on Saturday - a day after a 20-year -old
man lost his fight against the killer disease last Friday.

A spokesman for Portlaoise General Hospital said last night that the infant was
in a "stable condition".

But health officials last night insisted there wasn't a scare in the region over
the two cases.

A spokesman for the Midland Health Board said: "There was no social contact
between these two people. The two cases are totally unrelated."

The student at Carlow Regional Technical College died just hours after being
struck down with the disease.

Incidences of the illness have doubled in Ireland since 1994.

More than 500 cases were recorded last year, and 30 lives were claimed - most of
them young children.

Irish people are four times more likely to be hit than other Europeans.

The disease can easily fool sufferers as its early symptoms are like flu.

The most common symptoms of meningitis include severe headache, stiff neck and
dislike of bright lights.

Gasim determined to build state-of-the-art hospital in Maamigili

LENGTH: 287  words


Maamigili constituency MP and leader of the Jumhooree Party, Gasim Ibrahim has
said that he is determined to build a state of the art hospital in Maamigili.

Founder of the Villa Foundation, business tycoon Gasim Ibrahim made this remark
speaking at the ceremony held at Maamigili.

Gasim said that a technical team from Europe will be visiting Maamigili on
January 7 to initiate the technical works of the hospital. He said that they
will be finishing this work within 10 days. He said that after the work of the
technical team is concluded the construction works will begin according to the
counsel of the team.

Gasim said that the hospital will be managed by Europeon doctors. "I believe
that a thing can be fulfilled by the experts of that field. Therefore, this
hospital will be run with the partnership and assistance of professional doctors
from Europe," he said.

Gasim noted that the construction speed might not be as fast as hoped because of
the economic drawbacks that the world is experiencing today.

Meanwhile, Gasim was recently conferred with the degree of Doctor of
Entrepreneurship (honoris causa) by Open University Malaysia at their 13th
convocation held on 16th December 2012 at Merdeka Hall, Putra World Trade
Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The honorary doctorate award was  conferred on
to Gasim by the Chancellor of Open University Malaysia, Datin Seri Jeanne
Abdullah.

In his acceptance remarks, Gasim spoke about the lack of availability of
educational opportunities during his childhood in Maldives and that he felt that
this honour signifies that what one has learnt over the years can be measured in
broader terms of lifetime accomplishments as an alternative to a conventional
classroom attainment.

Health care helpers: 1st batch graduate

                                  May 24, 1993


THE first batch of certified health care assistants received their Institute of
Technical Education certificates yesterday.

For most of the 90, it was the end of a grind which saw them alternate between
looking after the sick and classroom activity for more than a year.

They will now work in private clinics or hospitals, and as medics with the
Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).

Dr Cheong Pak Yean, chairman of Healthcare Training Advisory Committee, ITE,
said: "The health care assistants will take over some of the duties of
registered nurses.

"This will enable the nurses to concentrate on their professional tasks."

At hospital level, the assistants will carry out duties such as bathing the
bedridden, attending to patients and taking a patient's height, weight,
temperature, and pulse and respiration rate.

They will act as receptionists, dispensers and laboratory technicians at private
clinics.

Many of the assistants, who received their certificates yesterday at the
Association of Private Medical Practitioners' annual dinner, are in their 30s
and have been in the nursing line for many years.

As part of their training, they spent 96 hours in the classroom and also
underwent supervised field training at their workplaces.

After this, they sat for a series of examinations which ended with the final ITE
test.

Fully equipped cardiac centre to be constructed at CDA hospital

SECTION: Vol. 13 No. 11

LENGTH: 262  words


The technical committee of CDA has approved three projects including
construction of cardiac centre, up-gradation and expansion of operation theatre
at CDA Hospital and matters related to Park Enclave Housing Project.

The meeting of technical committee of Capital Development Authority was held at
CDA Headquarters. Chairman Capital Development Authority, Maroof Afzal presided
over the meeting.

The committee approved the construction of state of the art cardiac centre at
CDA Hospital.

The cardiac centre will be constructed at cost of Rs190 million including cost
of machinery, other allied equipment and staff.

State of the art cardiac centre will be equipped with all latest facilities. It
was informed that CDA spends Rs25 million on cardiac patients who are referred
to other hospitals due to non-availability of these facilities at CDA hospitals.

After the establishment of this cardiac centre CDA would not only save Rs25
million but also earn a handsome amount by treating the non-entitled patients.

During the meeting it was decided that operation theatre at CDA hospital would
be up-graded, expanded and modernized according to present time needs.

In this regard it was decided that the operation theatre at CDA hospital would
be upgraded and expanded to enable it to conduct four operations simultaneously.

The technical committee also approved in principle to provide all facilities to
the allotees of Park Enclave Housing Project as committed in the broachers at
the time of auction / allotment. The PC-1 for Park Enclave Housing Project will
also be approved soon.

ITE: Students still keen on nursing

                            April 12, 2003 Saturday


THE Sars outbreak has not turned students off nursing, going by the number of
appeals for places on the Institute of Technical Education's (ITE) nursing
course.

Early last month, 444 O-level and N-level students applied for the two-year
course, which qualifies them to work as assistant nurses. This was four times
the number of places available.

Despite the Sars outbreak last month, about 150 students who were rejected have
appealed for places. And none of those accepted for the course has withdrawn.

Students currently doing the nursing course are just as keen. Those who are due
to go for their hospital attachments in July are keeping their fingers crossed
that it will not be affected.

ITE, like the polytechnics and universities, has remained open despite the Sars
outbreak. But the 186 nursing students who were attached to hospitals were
immediately withdrawn.

Second-year nursing student Shaffa Reny Saleh hopes her attachment to Singapore
General Hospital in July will not be affected.

The bubbly 23-year-old said: 'I can't wait to get back for more experience;
hopefully the situation will not be so bad by then.

'But even if it is, I would not mind going back. After all, this is the time
when nurses can do with the extra help.'

Even her first-year course mate Gan Thiam San, 34, who has a one-month-old son,
says he is not worried about his upcoming hospital attachment.

'I am more worried that I may not be able to go,' he said.

The former businessman, who gave up his cosmetic jewellery shop to join ITE,
said he has learnt about some of the more serious epidemics that have occurred
in the past.

'If you watch television and read the news, it is quite obvious that our poor
nurses and doctors are stretched. I would like to help, if I can.

'Watching them, I feel fortunate to have chosen the nursing profession.'

The Senior Minister of State for Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who
visited ITE's Bishan campus on Thursday, said he was glad to see that the Sars
outbreak had not scared off students.

He said ITE had done a good job in educating its 17,000 students on its 10
campuses out Sars and by putting in place precautionary measures.

Father of dead child leaves courtrooom after hearing of dangers Expert tells of
ventilator risk for babies

BYLINE: Bill Caven

SECTION: Pg. 9

LENGTH: 612 words


NURSING staff at a Glasgow hospital were unknowingly putting newly-born babies
at grave risk each time they placed them in a Sechrist ventilator, a technical
expert told a fatal accident inquiry yesterday.

The situation existed at the special baby care unit at the Southern General
Hospital for more than three years until the death of Danielle Gillogley last
year -- 13 hours after she was born.

Mr Alastair Plank, 30, a service engineer with a company which supplies and
maintains hospital equipment, confirmed that the Sechrist ventilator would not
be able to function properly if the medical air pressure exceeded a certain
level.

The result, he said, would be that the ventilator would not be able to deliver
pure oxygen as required, but only air.

Cross-examined by Mr Ian Sharpe QC, counsel for the family, Mr Plank agreed that
a child would receive as much oxygen and air from "an open window" as it would
from the ventilator in this unit.

Mr Sharpe continued: "If we can be clear about this, what you are telling us is
that every baby using this ventilator since 1989, and we are talking about a
considerable number of babies, was at risk, and a substantial risk at that?"

The service engineer nodded and replied: "Yes."

Seconds later, Mr Joe Gillogley, 30, whose daughter died in June of last year
after being born healthy, left the courtroom.

Earlier, Mr Plank told Sheriff Eric Galt that he had voiced his concern with the
hospital's technical staff after discovering that they had changed four-bar
probes to the older style seven-bar type.

He admitted that such a move was "extremely exceptional", adding that, on his
visits to nearly 70 hospitals, the Southern General was the only one operating
in this way.

The reason given, he said, was that the wall-mounted oxygen and medical air
pressure fittings only operated with seven bar fittings, although the actual
pressure was restricted to four.

The inquiry was told by Mr Plank that the pressures were clearly specified in a
document produced by the British Standards Authority. All respiratory equipment,
such as ventilators, operated on four-bar pressure while power tools required
the seven.

Asked by Mr Sharpe how he would react if it became known that a member of the
hospital's estates department was aware that the special baby care unit had been
operating on seven-bar pressure since 1981 despite the BS memo, the technical
expert admitted that he would be "outraged".

Mr Sharpe claimed that almost three months before Danielle's death an order had
been placed by the estates department for four-bar probes, despite knowing that
the existing air-oxygen pressure was being supplied at nearly twice this
requirement.

This was confirmed by Mr Gerald O'Hara, a technical officer at the Southern, who
said that an estates official had passed on this information during an internal
investigation to discover why the Sechrist ventilator appeared to be losing pure
oxygen levels.

Mr O'Hara, who is now at the Victoria Infirmary, said there had been little
contact between the medical physics department, who were responsible for the
equipment, and the estates department who looked after the oxygen-air pressure
pipes.

He agreed with Mr Sharpe when asked if it was a case of the "right hand not
knowing what the left hand was doing" -- "We never crossed over into their patch
and likewise," the technical officer said.

He admitted his total surprise on learning that the medical air and oxygen
pressures were substantially greater than that actually required by the
equipment.

The inquiry will resume at the beginning of January.

TAS teams with Lifeport to boost offerings for 'flying ambulances'

By AMANDA PEDERSEN Medical Device Daily Staff Writer

Imagine that near-fatal accident during rush hour in the middle of a heavily
populated city. An ambulance gets to the scene through heavy traffic, but it's
unlikely the vehicle would be able to get you to the nearest hospital in time.

The only alternative: an air "ambulance" is called in, a helicopter -- leaping
over all that rush hour traffic to save a life.

"Helicopters offer an unrestricted line of sight," Don Hubbard, a completions
manager at Texas Aviation Services (TAS; Fort Worth, Texas) told Medical Device
Daily. "The quickest way from point A to point B is a straight line -- that's
what you get with a helicopter."

TAS, a helicopter technical services company, said it is boosting its service
offerings to airborne EMS helicopter operations and hospitals.

It has teamed with Lifeport (Woodland, Washington) for new medical interior
configurations, expanding its technical workforce, and investing for broader
technical capacities at its Fort Worth facilities in order to take on more air
ambulance rotorcraft projects, the company said.

Hubbard said develops "flying ambulances" that are equipped with a wide array of
medical equipment for a range of life-saving offerings: multiple stretchers and
mounting devices, defibrillators and monitors. Added to this are communications
devices to allow the air medical crew to coordinate with the hospital about the
patient's status.

Besides responding to emergency scenes, the company's helicopters also provide
hospital-to-hospital transportation, Hubbard said.

TAS has performed 96 new "completions" for EMS fleet operators in the past 10
years, according to Tim Woodward, the company's president. He said the company's
most recent air ambulance helicopter was delivered to Omniflight (Addison,
Texas).

"TAS has over 20 years of experience in creating flying emergency rooms for air
medical customers," said Steve Townes, chairman of TAS and its parent company,
Ranger Aerospace and Aeronautics (Grapevine, Texas). "Our strategic teaming with
Lifeport, combined with Ranger's proven access to growth capital, means we can
focus even more on the unique needs of our air medical customers."

In other new ventures: BioReliance (Rockville, Maryland) said it has contracted
with Gentronix (Manchester, UK) to offer Gentronix's GreenScreen HC in vitro
assay as part of its portfolio of genotoxicity screening services.

GreenScreen HC, in conjunction with Ames II assays, is designed to allow
pharmaceutical companies to test for geneotoxic potential earlier in the
preclinical development process, using only a few milligrams of test compound as
opposed to the gram quantities required by current ICH regulatory tests,
according to the company.

GreenScreen HC is human cell-based genotoxicity screening assay that links the
regulation of human Growth Arrest and DNA Damage gene to the production of Green
Fluorescent Protein (GFP), the company said. Cells that have incurred DNA damage
upon exposure to a test compound express higher levels of detectable GFP.

The GreenScreen HC requires only 1 mg of "starting" material to demonstrate high
specificity, in contrast to other in vitro genetic toxicology assays that often
provide false positive results, according to Gentronix.

Gentronix develops tools for the drug-discovery field.

Safety device fails as two die

SECTION: Pg. 9

A LEADING Scottish psychiatric hospital, where four patients committed suicide
within eight weeks, last night admitted a special life-saving device failed to
prevent two of them taking their own lives.

The Royal Edinburgh Hospital admitted that special anti-suicide measures
installed around patients' beds had not worked. They said emergency work was
carried out yesterday afternoon and first thing this morning to rectify the
problem.

Edinburgh South MP Nigel Griffiths last night demanded an inquiry into why
curtain rails, designed to collapse under a weight of five stones or more, had
not done so and two patients had hung themselves from them.

A spokesman for Edinburgh Healthcare Trust, which runs the hospital, said the
victims had found a way round the safety device.

She added: "We needed to find technical solutions to this and work was carried
out yesterday and today. We carried out our own tests on the rails and they have
been shown to collapse but the victims managed to find a way round the safety
measures.

The spokeswoman said the "technical solutions" would be put in place in six
wards at the hospital.

It is believed the second suicide, around eight weeks after the first, was a
copy-cat. Mr Griffiths said questions must be asked over whether the second
death could have been avoided if the "technical solutions" had been put into
place earlier.

The other two suicides within the eight-week period were by patients who had
killed themselves while on passes from the hospital.

Mr Griffiths said he believed the poor conditions at the hospital and the lack
of adequate community back-up might have contributed to the deaths.

technical failures with our radiotherapy machines for the last couple of months

Hospital won't fight union issue

BYLINE: JENNIFER GOLDBLATT

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 222 words

DATELINE: BAYONET POINT



Officials from Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point say they do not plan to
challenge a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board that would uphold
employees' recent elections to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

"We just want to move forward and continue to provide the best possible health
care we can," said Kurt Conover, director of business development for the
hospital.

In October, the hospital's nurses and technical unit employees voted to join the
Teamsters. But the hospital filed unfair labor charges against the union on the
nurses' election, and the Teamsters challenged seven votes in the technical unit
election.

A hearing officer from the labor board has ruled that there was no merit to the
hospital or the union's objections and that the nurses' vote should be upheld.
The officer also ruled that the challenged votes for the technical workers
should be opened and counted. That election was 51-46 to unionize, so the votes
could change the outcome of the election.

Wednesday was the deadline to file objections to the hearing officer's findings.
The union filed no objections.

The hearing officer's ruling is a recommendation that will be submitted to the
labor board's Tampa office. Officials there will then decide whether to adopt
the ruling and certify the elections.

Fully equipped cardiac centre to be constructed at CDA hospital

SECTION: Vol. 16 No. 13

LENGTH: 262  words


The technical committee of CDA has approved three projects including
construction of cardiac centre, up-gradation and expansion of operation theatre
at CDA Hospital and matters related to Park Enclave Housing Project.

The meeting of technical committee of Capital Development Authority was held at
CDA Headquarters. Chairman Capital Development Authority, Maroof Afzal presided
over the meeting.

The committee approved the construction of state of the art cardiac centre at
CDA Hospital.

The cardiac centre will be constructed at cost of Rs 190 million including cost
of machinery, other allied equipment and staff.

State of the art cardiac centre will be equipped with all latest facilities. It
was informed that CDA spends Rs 25 million on cardiac patients who are referred
to other hospitals due to non-availability of these facilities at CDA hospitals.

After the establishment of this cardiac centre CDA would not only save Rs 25
million but also earn a handsome amount by treating the non-entitled patients.

During the meeting it was decided that operation theatre at CDA hospital would
be up-graded, expanded and modernized according to present time needs.

In this regard it was decided that the operation theatre at CDA hospital would
be upgraded and expanded to enable it to conduct four operations simultaneously.

The technical committee also approved in principle to provide all facilities to
the allotees of Park Enclave Housing Project as committed in the broachers at
the time of auction / allotment. The PC-1 for Park Enclave Housing Project will
also be approved soon.

SAfrica's University of Witwatersrand issues apology over Mandela "obituary"

LENGTH: 496 words


Text of report by South African newspaper Pretoria News on 21 June

[Report by Angelique Serrao: "Wits Sorry Over Obituary for Madiba"]

WITS University issued an apology yesterday after an obituary written on Nelson
Mandela became public. The university said it had prepared the document, for
when the former statesman died, and had hidden it on its system.

"However, a technical error made this available via the search function on
Google," Wits said.

The institution said that at no stage did it issue the obituary as a statement
or publish it on its website.

The obituary, titled "Hamba kahle Tata Mandela [Rest in Peace Mr Mandela]",
spoke about Mandela's history with the university, mentioning that he studied
there and received an honorary doctorate at the institution.

Wits apologised to "family members, friends, fellow South Africans and global
citizens" for the obituary making its way on to the internet.

It regretted the mishap and has launched an investigation to get to the root of
the technical glitch to find out which department was responsible for the
incident, it said.

This is not the first time Nelson Mandela's death has been announced mistakenly.

In April, the last time Mandela was in hospital with a respiratory infection,
DStv's Universal Channel ran a documentary, titled "Remembering Madiba
1918-2013".

The ANC was outraged at the broadcast, and branded it insensitive. Universal
Channel apologised for the broadcast, saying it had obituaries ready for major
statesmen. It also said the documentary was run owing to a technical error.

In December, again when Mandela was in hospital, e.tv was also forced to
apologise when it included file footage of Mandela's wife Graca Machel saying
the former statesman had lost his sparkle. The footage was in fact taken in 2009
and was not related to Mandela's hospital stay at the time.

eNCA news anchor Jeremy Maggs apologised to viewers that the file footage had
made its way into a news story.

Meanwhile, Mandela's wife Graca Machel yesterday arrived at the MediClinic Heart
Hospital in the city where Mandela is being treated for a lung infection.

Mandela's daughter Zenani Mandela-Dlamini, who is South Africa's ambassador to
Argentina, also visited with Madiba's grandchildren Zoleka and Zaziwe
Dlamini-Manaway. They were with Zaziwe's husband, US businessman David Manaway.

He was "doing very well", MandelaDlamini said while collecting get-well cards
outside the hospital on Monday.

ANC MP Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, also arrived at the hospital accompanied by
her daughter Zindzi.

The elderly statesman was spending his 13th day in hospital. Mandela, 94, was
admitted to hospital on June 8. The Presidency said he was in a "serious but
stable" condition.

Several close relatives of the antiapartheid icon have visited him daily.

Well-wishers have adorned the hospital's perimeter wall with get-well-soon
cards, bouquets of flowers, balloons, sculptures, and flags.

Lack of female technical staff in X-Ray departments , a perpetual sources of
nuisance for female patients

SECTION: Vol. 22 No. 198

LENGTH: 199  words


Lack of female technical staff in X-Ray departments in all allied hospitals at
Rawalpindi has caused embarrassment among female patients.

According to media reports, women are forced to undergo X-RAY tests in the
presence of male technical staff in all the three allied hospitals and this
state of affairs has given rise to reports of their harassment at the hands of
male technicians.

In  Benazir hospital, Holy family hospital and DHQ hospital Rawalpindi the ratio
of female staff stands next to nil. It has become a custom that no female
technician is employed and if any one is appointed she is not deputed in X-Ray
department. Due to this situation, the incidents of teasing and harassing the
female patients by male staff are on rise. If any female patient lodges
complaint against any male technician the matter is hushed up.

The poor female patients are forced to undergo X-Ray test in private
laboratories at inflated fee.

The citizens have demanded of chief minister Punjab to take notice of this
alarming situation and order for appointment of female technicians and if they
are not available then female helpers to stem growing incidents of harassment
and indecency in the allied hospitals.

Doctors Rule Out Cholera Epidemic

BYLINE: By Bronwyn McLaren

SECTION: No. 1487

LENGTH: 556 words


Staff Writer

Investigators have tracked down the source of the cholera bacteria that infected
a father and son, and there is no risk of a cholera epidemic in Moscow, the
chief doctor at the city's health inspection service said Thursday.

"Yes, it was an unpleasant incident, but I can now guarantee you that this
threat (of a cholera epidemic) remains in history," said Dr. Nikolai Filatov.

Moscow's first cholera victim of 1998 was hospitalized June 22, five days after
he fell ill. The second victim - the man's son - was hospitalized with the
disease a week later. The two men are Moscow's only registered cholera cases
this year.

Their infection raised fears of a citywide epidemic, and 548 people who came
into contact with the infected men were tested. Of these, only eight remain
under observation in Infectious Diseases Hospital No. 2, and all have tested
negative for the disease, a hospital spokesman said.

A city government commission established to find the source of the disease
presented its conclusions Thursday.

The source of the cholera was tracked down to Moskovsky Podshipnik, the ball
-bearing factory in southeast Moscow where the elder cholera patient, works. He
became infected after drinking unpotable "technical water."

Technical water is not purified to the same level as drinking water. It is
therefore cheaper and used only for industrial purposes, such as cooling.

Under Russian health regulations, technical water should remain completely
enclosed and should not be accessible through common household faucets.

A sign hung over the offending tap, warning workers not to drink the water. The
victim was the only one out of 6,500 workers at the factory to drink from the
tap, Filatov said.

The chief doctor said it is possible that criminal proceedings will be brought
against whomever is found responsible for allowing contaminated, technical water
to flow freely.

"All the results from our investigations have been handed over to Moscow's
prosecutor general," Filatov said.

The ball-bearing company could not be reached for comment Thursday.

Police, water-system workers and emergency personnel joined in the frantic hunt
for the cholera's source, which Filatov said cost "a colossal amount of money."

The commission carried out 2,500 cholera tests on food and water at a cost of 16
rubles ($ 2.60) each. The first patient, 65, remains in serious condition in
Infectious Diseases Hospital No. 2. He is suffering from a chronic kidney
disease that was exacerbated by the cholera. Doctors fear for his life. His son,
35, remains ill in the same hospital, but there is no longer any threat to his
life.

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by contaminated water. It is usually
found in Third World countries where sanitation is poor.

Although last year Moscow health authorities found rivers contaminated with
cholera bacteria in five places, this year, no traces have been found, Filatov
said.

Every year, Moscow experiences some five or six cases of cholera, brought into
the capital by visitors from other regions, Filatov said. He also said the
federal health inspection service has placed doctors at railway border crossings
and airports to check people coming from places like Kazakhstan and Dagestan,
where the risk is considered high.

Ambitious hopes for Health University Technical College

SECTION: AGENCY:MEDIA; Pg. 2-3

LENGTH: 362  words


GLOUCESTER could become home to a state-of-the art health university training
doctors and nurses to fill the county's skills gap.

The University of Gloucestershire, the NHS Gloucestershire Hospitals Foundation
Trust and MP for Gloucester Richard Graham announced the plan yesterday.

They will submit a bid in October to the Baker Dearing Trust for a new
Gloucestershire Health University Technical College based within the grounds of
Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

It will enable 14 to 18-year-olds to gain qualifications and experience in the
NHS.

The bid, a joint statement said, "reflects the vital importance and size of the
health sector in our county - almost 50,000 jobs in Gloucestershire - and
recognition that there isn't enough training for the skills needed at the moment
in the county".

Dr Frank Harsent, the outgoing chief executive of the hospitals trust, added:
"Much needs to be done to address this and a UTC focused on health futures, with
work experience in a variety of different institutions and roles, will make a
huge difference."

Mr Graham has led discussions exploring the potential for such a facility since
hearing from Lord Baker, chairman of the Baker Dearing Trust, which was set up
to explore the viability of new university technical colleges, about the new
West Bromwich Health Futures UTC.

Mr Graham said: "I thought there was enormous potential for a UTC based in
Gloucester, close to the city centre transport links, so that students could
come from all over the county."

Overseas recruitment drives for nurses to staff   hospitals have become a common
theme in recent years, with 200 Filipino nurses hired last March and many more
coming from Spain and Portugal.

University   vice-chancellor Stephen Marston said: "Given the importance of the
health service, we are keen to work with the hospitals trust and other NHS
partners to help ensure they can recruit the staff they need to provide
excellent patient care, particularly through increasing the supply of qualified
nurses."

Dr Harsent said Gloucestershire Royal was the right site: "We have the space
and, if the bid is successful, the  capital expenditure  from the Baker Dearing
Trust."

No technical guidelines issued

BYLINE: Muhammad Qasim

SECTION: Vol. 25 No. 353

LENGTH: 565  words


The district health department and the three teaching hospitals in town received
no technical guidelines from the government so far to check incidence of Zika
virus disease and to manage its cases in case they appear.

Ironical it is to hear from top health officials that the government issued no
directives so far regarding surveillance and treatment of Zika virus disease
because the incidence of the infection has not been reported anywhere in
Pakistan as yet.

Benazir Bhutto Hospital has not received any directives so far from the
government about management protocol of suspected patients with Zika virus
disease nor the hospital has any testing facility for confirmation of the
infection in a patient, said Medical Superintendent at BBH Dr. Asif Qadir Mir
while talking to 'The News' on Monday.

He added that the BBH can provide supportive medication to suspected patients of
Zika virus disease in case of its incidence as there is no medication available
for Zika virus disease around the globe.

To date, the District Headquarters Hospital has received no technical guidelines
on management of suspected patients of Zika virus disease nor has the hospital
administration been informed of availability of testing facility for
confirmatory tests in case of suspected patients, said DHQ Hospital chief Dr.
Khalid Randhawa while talking to 'The News'.

To a query, he however admitted that the situation is alarming as the breeding
of vector for dengue fever and Zika virus disease, 'aedes aegypti', could not be
controlled in the region.

It is important that the mosquitoes 'aedes aegypti' and 'aedes albopictus' are
considered as the main vectors for transmission of Zika virus disease like that
of dengue fever virus. Also it is important that there is no testing facility
available in Pakistan for confirmation of Zika virus infection in a patient.

Executive District Officer (Health) Dr. Arshad Ali Sabir, when contacted, said
the Punjab government has not issued any directives on measures to check Zika
virus disease as no case of the infection has so far been reported in the
country. Mode of transmission of Zika virus is same like that of dengue virus
and we are already working for elimination of mosquitoes 'aedes aegypti', he
said.

To a query, he said that no special precautions are needed at the time for
surveillance against Zika virus disease because the virus does not exist in
Pakistan. In case its cases are reported, what the health department can do is
to only work for controlling vector of the disease, he said.

Zika virus disease is not fatal; he said and added that it may only cause
congenital microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small
heads. For quarantine at airports, provincial governments can do nothing instead
the federal government should frame a national policy, he said while responding
to a query.

Zika virus infection is more alarming because it symptomatic in only about one
out of every five cases. When symptomatic, Zika infection usually presents as an
influenza-like syndrome, often mistaken for other arboviral infections like
dengue or chikungunya.

It is important that the government has done nothing so far for surveillance of
Zika virus disease even at international points of entry, ports and airports nor
the ports and airports are being monitored to ensure early detection of any
exotic mosquitoes from endemic countries.

Pounds 1m for Sligo hospital

SECTION: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY; IN BRIEF; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 124 words


A FORMER hospital in Sligo with planning permission to be converted into a
156-bedroom hotel, conference centre and holiday village has come on the market.
Denis O'Reilly of Gunne is quoting a guideline price of Pounds 700,000 to Pounds
1 million for the impressive three-storey over basement Victorian building,
which has about 90,000 square feet of space. There is a further 50,000 square
feet in other buildings at the rear. The former St Columba's Hospital is one
mile from the town and is opposite Sligo Regional Technical College. Gunne says
that in addition to a hotel, the buildings could be used for student
accommodation or could be converted into apartments, a nursing home, educational
institute or for leisure purposes.

Medical Equipment Lie Idle Sans Tech Staff

LENGTH: 313 words

DATELINE: BENGALURU


BENGALURU, Dec. 29 -- Medical equipment worth crores of rupees bought in the
last three years are lying idle in government hospitals across the State due to
shortage of technical staff to operate them.

The situation in some hospitals is so acute that doctors are doubling as
operators in the interest of patients.

This startling information was given in a written reply by Health and Family
Welfare minister UT Khader to Puttaranga Shetty of Congress in the Assembly
during the recent Belagavi session. He said that hundreds of crores of rupees
had been spent in the last three years to provide modern equipment for
government hospitals all over the state to improve the quality of medical
services for the poor.

The minster had admitted that posts of medical equipment operators and lab
technicians were vacant in many hospitals, including district hospitals in the
State. However, he said that measures were taken to fill these posts. "We have
started the recruitment process for filling 377 posts of lab technicians and 37
X-ray machine technicians. Personnel for operating scanning machines too are
being recruited," he said.

He stated that costly scanning machines were being operated by doctors
themselves in many places to ensure that the patients did not suffer due to
non-availability of technical staff. But this would be a thing of the past soon
as technical staff were being recruited, he assured the House.

The hospitals all over the State have been instructed to provide a list of their
demands for modern equipment to ensure that they are provided without any delay.
"We are committed to providing high class medical services to people even in
rural areas," he added.

Pakistan: PIMS patient safety initiative to be replicated across Pakistan

LENGTH: 485  words

DATELINE: Islamabad


Islamabad, June 03 -- Having been piloted at the Pakistan Institute of Medical
Sciences (PIMS), the Patient Safety Friendly Hospital Initiative (PSFHI) will
now be introduced at the national, regional and institutional levels,
participants of a three-day workshop held at PIMS to build the capacity of
clinicians, hospital staff and managers in implementation of the PSFHI were
informed.

The workshop is being attended by doctors from 12 hospitals from all over the
country including Mastung, Skardu, Muzaffarabad, Jhelum and Peshawar. Secretary
Health Khushnood Lashari was the chief guest at the workshop's inaugural
session. He was flanked by WHO Representative Dr. Khalif Bile, WHO EMRO trainer
Dr. Sameen Siddiqi, acting executive director of PIMS Professor Mehmood Jamal
and Joint ED Dr. Jehanzeb Aurakzai. The participants were informed that a
national network of trainers and surveyors for PSFHI will be developed, along
side a mechanism for communication with WHO country and regional offices. PSFHI
aims to encourage safe health practices in hospitals and involves implementation
of a set of patient safety standards.

The major steps involved in the process include assessment of current level of
patient safety in the hospital, provision of technical assistance for improving
the level of patient safety, follow-up assessment to demonstrate improvement;
and technical assistance to develop a national safety programme. Infection
control is a key prerequisite for attainment of patient safety, as it
contributes to a significant reduction in the burden of disease attributable to
health care-associated infections. Another challenge is to improve the safety of
surgical care in all healthcare settings.

Patient Safety is a WHO strategy in which member states are urged to develop
national standards for patient safety, making use of WHO technical guiding
documents; formulating national patient safety programmes in collaboration with
the Regional Office and the World Alliance for Patient Safety; and establishing
mechanisms to promote partnership between regional patient safety institutions
and national health care delivery systems.

PSFHI aims to instigate and encourage safe health practices in hospitals and
involves the implementation of a set of patient safety standards in these health
institutions. Patient safety standards and implementation guidelines have been
developed at Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (WHO/EMRO). The Patient
Safety Initiative covers a wide array of areas, which are divided into the five
section including 'Leadership and Management Measures', 'Patient and Public
Involvement Measures', 'Safe Evidence based Clinical Practices Measures', 'Safe
environment Measures' and 'Lifelong Learning Measures Published by HT

STAFF ROTATIONS

EXCITEMENT, nervousness, pride and relief after many years of study are emotions
running through 67 medical graduates who have begun work as interns at St George
Hospital and Sutherland Hospital.

During the year, the new doctors will work between the two hospitals, gaining
experience in various departments.

Five of the new interns come from the St George district, while another five
hail from the shire.

Addison He, of Bexley, attended Sydney Technical High School and Fort Street
High School before medical studies at the University of Sydney.

His first posting was to the aged-care department at Sutherland Hospital.

"Despite having learnt and undertaken similar processes at Westmead Hospital,
which was my clinical school, it is really different putting it all into
practice at Sutherland," he said.

"I was a bit nervous on my first day, but a lot more confident after that."

Laura Fitzgerald, of Brighton-Le-Sands, and Andrew Inglis, of Blakehurst, are
also working in aged care at Sutherland Hospital.

Dr Fitzgerald, who attended St Vincent's College Potts Point before studying at
the University of NSW, said she was "excited, but a bit nervous".

Dr Inglis's path to a career in medicine was unusual.

After attending Sydney Technical High School, he gained an engineering degree at
the University of NSW and a PhD in chemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology in Germany.

This was followed by medical studies at the University of Sydney.

"Engineering sets you up with a really good skills set and problem-solving
[ability]," he said.

"I had an interest in diseases and general health care, so I thought, 'Why not
put the two together?' "

Tim Duong, of Kogarah, who also attended Sydney Technical High School, obtained
a degree in pharmacy before studying medicine at the University of Sydney.

Along the way, he gained a diploma of paramedical science, and worked on
weekends as a paramedic at Port Botany, caring for people with workplace
injuries and, occasionally, medical conditions.

Dr Duong's initial work at St George Hospital involves 10 weeks of night shifts.

"It is a bit nerve-racking because there are fewer doctors at night, and you
have more responsibility, but it is exciting to be able to put into practice all
the things we have learnt over the last eight years," he said.

Andrew Tse, of Kogarah, attended Sydney Boys High School before medical studies
at the University of NSW.

His internship began in liver surgery at St George Hospital.

"Do you think young doctors get the support they need? Have your say at
theleader.com.au

"Forty-three interns were appointed to St George Hospital, and 24 to Sutherland
Hospital.

"During the year, they will rotate between the two hospitals, gaining experience
in various departments.

"A total of 980 medical graduates were given internships at NSW public
hospitals.

* Graduates are celebrating National Career and Technical Education Week this
week.

When Jamie Helms of St. Louis County enrolled in the veterinary technology
program at Jefferson College in Hillsboro, she had no idea about the exotic
internship awaiting her less than a year later.

What she knew was that she wanted to work with animals and help them stay
healthy.

"I didn't have a clue that I'd be working on a gorilla," she said. "Cats and
dogs don't compare."

Helms, now 29 and working for the Bridgeton Animal Hospital, found herself
cleaning the mouth of a sedated gorilla with a suction tube while preparing the
animal for some dental work when she worked as an intern at the St. Louis Zoo in
the summer of 2003.

She said such experiences at the zoo helped prepare her for her a job assisting
veterinarians at the animal hospital at 3148 McKelvey Road in Bridgeton.

"I love what I'm doing now," Helms said.

She noted that she primarily works with dogs and cats at the Bridgeton clinic.
"I'm basically a nurse to the veterinarians," she said.

Helms said the associate's degree she earned at Jefferson College helped her get
ready to care for animals large and small. It's a much more rewarding job than
the billing and title work she did for auto dealers before enrolling in the
veterinary technology program, she said.

Helms earned her associate's degree last May and started her current job in
June. She credited Jefferson College for lining up her zoo internship. The
program provided good, hands-on training for the working world, she said.

College officials said they viewed their role at a community college as giving
students both educational and practical job experiences. The college is joining
other schools in observing National Career and Technical Education Week this
week.

Jefferson College offers more than 20 technical education programs. In most of
them, students have the choice of pursuing either an associate degree or a
career education certificate.

College officials said they can find immediate jobs for almost all of their
technical education graduates.

"In most of Jefferson College's technical programs, we receive many more job
leads than we could ever fill," said Frank Thoendel, the dean of technical
education. "For students, this often results in a variety of job opportunities
to choose from."

A test of patience as new RAH stays empty until 2017

BYLINE: BRAD CROUCH MEDICAL REPORTER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 614  words


THE State Government must wait until at least September before it is handed the
keys to the $2.1 billion new Royal Adelaide Hospital and ongoing delays mean
patients will not move in before 2017.

Building consortium HYLC has briefed stakeholders and the State Government on
its latest technical completion target, telling them it now looks like
mid-September, but without a firm date. It has missed three target dates so far
this year.

These delays have repeatedly pushed back the opening date for patients and
Health Minister Jack Snelling says the new target means plans for a belated
November 30 opening will now likely be abandoned.

Technical completion is when the Government takes ownership for three months of
testing to ensure the complex is built to specifications.

This latest timeline, combined with the complexity of shifting from the existing
RAH to the new building, means the new RAH is not expected to be operational
until well into 2017. Mr Snelling is taking the latest target with a grain of
salt after HYLC repeatedly missed its earlier stated targets.

"That is the builder's date, they have not had a great track record of providing
accurate dates in the past so we are independently assessing whether it is
realistic or not," he told The Advertiser.

"If it was to be September, it would be unlikely that we would be in the new
hospital by the end of the year.

"My main priority is we move into the hospital when it is safe to do so and it
is not rushed." The builders do not face any penalty for the delay.

The latest delay means a saving for the State Budget - the Government does not
begin paying SA Health Partnership the agreed $1 million a day until after the
three-month testing period.

SAHP is the project consortium responsible for the financing, design,
construction, commissioning and facility management under a public-private
partnershipPrivate Partnership with a 35 year contract.

SAHP chief executive Duncan Jewell said builders HYLC - which is part of SAHP -
has submitted an updated Recovery Plan and Program which SAHP and the State
Government are reviewing.

"Until this review is complete and all parties agree, no updated technical
completion date for the new RAH can be set," he said.

"Technical completion marks the point at which the state can commence clinical
commissioning, scenario and staff training sessions that lead to Commercial
Acceptance, and ultimately the handing over of the facility to the state.

"As the project nears completion, additional resources continue to be employed
on site, and will do so until technical completion is achieved, with every
effort to progress the works in a timely and safe manner." Meanwhile, the
troubled EPAS system will "go live" at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital on June 29.

Central Adelaide Local Health Network chief executive Julia Squire has told
staff the $422 million electronic patient record system will be 'a major
improvement to how we deliver care.' "The hospital will be the first Central
Adelaide Local Health Network site to 'Go-Live' with EPAS and the eighth site to
be activated across South Australia," she told staff in a memo seen by The
Advertiser.

Opposition health spokesman Stephen Wade said EPAS was an ongoing fiasco. "EPAS
is a slow moving train wreck threatening patient care and the state budget," he
said.

"EPAS is currently $200 million overbudget. It was meant to be operating in 10
metropolitan hospitals two years ago - it is currently only operating in two.

"The QEH will be first large hospital to receive EPAS and doctors have expressed
alarm at the risks - this is the biggest test that EPAS has faced yet."TIMELAPSE

NEWS BRIEFS School to expand medical programs

SECTION: EXTRA; Section G; Page 2

LENGTH: 585 words


Chattahoochee Tech is adding three new medical technology programs this fall,
pending final budget authorization from the state for equipment.

The new programs would be diplomas in respiratory therapy and surgical
technology and an associate degree in biomedical engineering technology. The
programs would expand the technical institute's health care curriculum, which
includes medical assisting programs and practical nursing.

The new programs were recently authorized under the school's 1994 budget, which
includes seven new faculty positions. Chattahoochee Tech officials planned to
meet this week with representatives from Cobb Hospital and Medical Center and
Kennestone Hospital to discuss course curriculum.

"Through feedback from area hospitals, it became very clear that there is a
shortage of medical technicians," Harlon Crimm, president of Chattahoochee Tech.

Smyrna cracks down on holiday DUIs: Smyrna police say they put an early end to
Independence Day partying for about 25 people whom they cited for driving under
the influence. Chief Stanley Hook said that 15 DUI citations for a weekend is
average. Part of the crackdown involved a sobriety check roadblock on Spring
Road east of Atlanta Road for several hours late on July 4. Lt. Mike Brown, head
of the traffic enforcement program, said the holiday crackdown was in response
to the weekend's history of auto crashes, injuries and fatalities. "Last year,
there were 14 fatalities in Georgia over the July Fourth weekend," the
lieutenant said. "We wanted to do our part to cut down on that."

GED ceremonies tonight at North Metro: Graduation ceremonies for approximately
300 students who have earned GEDs at North Metro Tech will be at 7 tonight in
the Economic Development Building on the North Metro campus in Acworth.

GEDs are awarded to students who have completed courses of study that are
approximately equivalent to the course work required to receive a high school
diploma. The commencement speaker will be Edward F. Meehan, general manager of
the Learning Concepts Group, a vocational training group based in Atlanta.

Writing workshop lined up at Southern Tech: High school students can learn how
to sharpen their writing, spelling and grammar skills by attending a summer
workshop at Southern Tech in Marietta.

The program will run July 19-23 and July 26-30 from 1 to 5 p.m. in Southern
Tech's Academic Building. The programs will be designed for individual needs.
Susan Morrow, a language arts con sultant for the Cobb County school system,
will critique assignments daily to monitor students' progress.

The cost is $ 150. For information, Call 528-7240.

Rainwater to succeed Traylor on Austell Gas board: Grant Rainwater has been
appointed to the board of Austell Gas Co., replacing J.L. Traylor, who is
resigning for health reasons. Current members R.E. Long Jr. and Hank Floyd were

N$9,4 Million Plot for Hospital in Katutura

BYLINE: Shinovene Immanuel

LENGTH: 557 words


PLANS to set up a private health centre in Katutura suburb in Windhoek went a
step forward after the municipality approved the sale of a N$9,4 million plot
for the construction of the hospital.

The plot which measures about 27 000 square metres has been sold to Otjomuise
Hospital Property Limited which is co-owned by well-known medical practitioners
Thomas and Puleinge Ihuhua.

The two doctors are part of a six-member team that has decided to set up a
private health centre at the plot situated on Katutura's Claudius Kandovazu
Street. The other co-owners are Alugodhi Kanyama, Ingrid Muhenye and Zimbabwean
nationals Orippa Madziwa and Daniel Bengesai.

The Development Bank of Namibia approached the council in 2011 about the
proposal to set up the Otjomuise Hospital on behalf of the six medical
practitioners.

The council decided last week to sell the plot that has an estimated market
value of N$11,4 million.

Although the initial application for the development of the hospital was made in
2011, the matter was referred back by the council after it informed the
applicants that there was need to get an input from the municipality technical
team since the plot had overhead power lines which affected the erven. According
to council documents, the technical team was also worried about the lack of
access to the road although provision for this could be made.

The municipality earlier said that the issue with regard to the negative impact
the power lines have on the erven has hampered the evaluation and eventual sale
of the erven.

The municipality thus proposed that the 118,971 square metre plot be divided
into two - A and B erven. The estimated value of the two plots were N$9,4
million and N$11,4 million.

"The subdivisions that is now proposed indicates how the power lines can be
accommodated and thus solves the problem," the municipality expert team said.

As a result, the technical team proposed that portion B be sold for the
development of a hospital.

The municipality recommended "that all the utility services, including the
street, be extended to portion B and that it is considered that the cost thereof
be subtracted from the set price [N$9,4 million]".

The plot is centrally located with several schools in the immediate vicinity and
also in close proximity with the Katutura State Hospital.

The department of infrastructure, water and technical services also gave the
green light for the sale as a sewer connection is available and water supply
services to the area are adequate.

The urban planning and property management department wanted clarity on where
the hospital will fall as it is seen as a 'business entity', recommending that
the council considers this as a private treaty sale because Windhoek has a
shortage of hospitals.

According to the property management team, road extension or improvements should
be done while provisions should also be made to improve intersection of Bondel
and Hans-Dierich Genscher Streets to accommodate transport to and from the
hospital.

The management committee made about 30 recommendations, one of which is for the
Otjomuise Hospital to finalise the sale within 18 months from the date of the
council resolution otherwise the sale will be canceled and the plot re-sold.

Other conditions are a reverting clause and restrictive resale conditions to be
registered in favour of the council.

Also unnoticed

LENGTH: 271 words


PROFESSOR R. Beal in his letter "Unnoticed" (The Advertiser, 13/1/94) did not go
far enough in expressing his gratitude for the health service provided during
the Christmas period.

Not only do a few hundred hospital scientists and pathology technical staff go
unnoticed but also unheard and unrewarded. The public should be told that
donated blood cannot be released for use until thoroughly tested by Red Cross
technical and scientific staff.

Nor can blood be transfused (unless an extreme emergency) before tranfusion
staff perform compatibility testing in SA's major hospitals. This is to avoid
transfusion reactions.

Hospital scientists and the technical staff under their direction are the silent
providers of accurate patient specific information in the pathology areas of
microbiology, haematology, chemistry and histopathology.

It is this information on which the doctors rely in order to make approriate
clinical decisions. Without such information, we, the public would not only
observe but also experience a far more ineffective and inefficient health
system.

The research undertaken by hospital scientists in our major hospitals today will
directly enhance the provision of a service of excellence tomorrow.

However, no one hears of these tireless, dedicated scientists, who the
Department of Labor denies recognising with an appropriate award, because they
get on with supporting the quality of life we all expect.

Not only should we praise and support donors of a scarce resource, doctors and
nurses but also all those involved in providing patient care 365 days of the
year.

Legislator pushing for Camden campus

BYLINE: Gordon Jackson, The Brunswick News, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 482 words


Jan. 06--WOODBINE -- Obtaining funding for a new technical college campus in
Camden County is the No. 1 priority for state Rep. Jason Spencer when the
General Assembly convenes for its annual legislative session Jan. 13.

Spencer, R-Woodbine, said he and Sen. William Ligon, R-St. Simons Island, will
work together to make a technical college a reality in Camden County.

Funding for the $16 million campus at a 31-acre site in Kingsland off Interstate
95 at Exit 7 was pulled unexpectedly last year after concerns were raised about
the simultaneous construction of new Altamaha Technical College campuses in
Brunswick and Kingsland.

The city of Kingsland and the Camden County Joint Development Authority have
already spent an estimated $500,000 to build the infrastructure needed to
support a campus at the site.

Spencer said he will ask for funding for the Kingsland campus and for
improvements to a technical college in Waycross that will be part of the merger
between Okefenokee and Altamaha technical colleges. The two colleges will be
named Coastal Pines Technical College after the merger goes into effect in July.

"It really looks good this year," Spencer said of the possibility of funding for
a technical college in Kingsland.

Spencer said he will be among a group of elected officials to introduce
legislation to prohibit the state from implementing the Affordable Health Care
Act. Spencer, a physician's assistant, said his proposal is to ask for
legislation that will prevent the state from using resources to support the
federal health care act.

"This will break the bank," Spencer said of Obamacare.

He will also introduce legislation to revise how hospital authorities are
managed and how members are appointed.

Spencer said the court resolved his concerns with the St. Marys Hospital
Authority this year. But the debate over how the proceeds from a nursing home
should be spent led him to discover other concerns.

"We've got problems across the state," he said.

Spencer said he plans to ask for approval for the St. Marys authority to change
its name to the St. Marys Senior Citizens Service Authority. He expects the bill
for the name change and mission statement will be approved by fellow
legislators.

He wants to encourage physicians to volunteer more often by introducing
legislation that will reduce the risk of malpractice lawsuits if they provide
indigent health care.

Spencer also wants to make it more difficult for voters to raise taxes.

He plans to ask for legislation requiring 60 percent of voters to approve any
Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax in the future.

Apollo & Medanta in race

BYLINE: Shuchismita Chakraborty

LENGTH: 399  words


Apollo and Medanta have emerged as the prospective private players who would be
awarded the work of constructing super-speciality hospital at Jaiprabha
Hospital's land.

The representatives of both the hospital groups on Thursday submitted the
technical bid documents to the health department.

Commissioning of a super-speciality hospital in the state is one of the most
ambitious projects of the state government as the state does not have a single
such hospital at present. Though the state-run hospitals have many
super-speciality departments but none of them is fully equipped. So far as
private hospitals are concerned, the state only has multi-speciality hospitals,
which have limited number of departments unlike a super-speciality hospital
which has department of all disciplines.

Pankaj Sinha, investment officer, International Finance Corporation (IFC), the
agency playing the role of consultant in the project, said: "Of the six groups
which took part in the pre-bid meeting, only two noted groups have submitted
their technical bid document on Thursday - Medanta and Apollo. The rest - Asian
Institute of Medical Sciences (Faridabad)), Glocal Healthcare Systems Private
Limited (Calcutta), Narayan Hrudayala (Bangalore) and Abengoa (a Spanish
multi-national company) - did not submit their technical bid documents."

Pankaj added that the financial bid of the project would be opened after a week
and based on its evaluation, the health department would decide about the
private player, which has to be handed over the project. "The department wants
to clear out the uncertainty about the private player's name, whom the project
has to be awarded, within this month only," he added.

Sources said that according to plan, a 500-bed super-speciality hospital has to
be developed by a private player on Jaiprabha Hospital's seven-acre land. The
private player would be given the land of Jaiprbha Hospital on a 30-year lease.
The total expected expenditure on this project is something around Rs 300 crore.

Bihar Health Services Association general secretary Ranjit Kumar said the
government should first strengthen its existing hospital, then it should think
about taking up these kinds of projects.

"The state government has opened super-speciality hospital for eye. There is
also a super-speciality hospital for orthopaedic disorder but none of these
meets the international standard," he said.

Student 'doctors' heal kid's toys

SOURCE: Yomiuri

SECTION: Pg. 23

LENGTH: 454 words


The mobile hospital where high school students repair broken toys free of charge
has become a popular enterprise among residents of Toyama Prefecture.

Students of Tonami Technical High School in Tonami established the workshop in
1998, and have opened it a few times a year ever since.

"I'm so happy," said Risako Tamaru, a 9-year-old girl of Fukunomachi, while
holding a toy that had just been repaired at the hospital.

She brought a tape recorder with a microphone to the students, who operate out
of a six-square-meter tent set up in a shopping mall in the city.

According to Risako's mother, Atsuko, 39, the girl bought the machine seven
years ago. Even though it broke a few years later, Risako insisted on keeping
it, so they brought it to the hospital in August.

"This toy is old, and I thought it wouldn't work anymore, so I'm really grateful
to the hospital," Risako said.

The hospital already has opened three times this year. Its last opening for the
year will be in Shogawamachi as a part of a festival in November.

Students who belong to the prefectural high school's engineering club work as
"doctors" at the hospital. Among the 50 members of the club, a group of 10 to 20
students who take courses in mechanics and electronics volunteer at the
hospital. The students sometimes receive up to 30 orders at a single event and
work on a wide variety of toys, including model trains and keyboards.

"Most of the toys are easy to fix. Sometimes it's just a matter of wiring," said
Satoshi Tomita, 43, a teacher at the high school and the club's adviser.

The students are very serious about repairing toys that children are deeply
attached to--carefully soldering wires together on internal substrates and
checking mechanics.

The students repaired 20 toys in August.

"I felt nervous when I couldn't understand why the toys didn't work. But I was
really happy when the kids said thank you," said Yuji Takata, a second-year high
school student studying electronics.

Tomoyuki Akahoshi, also a second-year student in electronics, who had joined the
hospital for the first time, said with a smile: "I really enjoyed it. The work
is satisfying."

Through the activity, the students are given the opportunity to meet the members
of their community. The way students explain why the toys did not work to
children and passersby has gained them trust within the community.

From time to time, the club receives letters thanking the students for their
work.

Vice Principal Naoki Ikeda, 50, said: "Students in the club learn about the joy
of creating things, and at the same time, they discover the rewards of
thoughtfulness for others. So this activity assists in the children's
education."

Zoo hospital non-functional for a decade

BYLINE: FAIZA ILYAS

SECTION: Vol. LXIX No. 229

LENGTH: 562  words


Though injury and disease have claimed the lives of many zoo animals over the
past decade, there has been no effort on the part of the Karachi Metropolitan
Corporation (KMC) to hire technical staff and make the zoo hospital functional,
it emerged on Wednesday.

A visit to the facility showed that renovation of the quarantine, part of the
hospital, which has been ongoing for about two years at an exorbitant cost of
Rs20m, has been suspended while the hospital equipment is in a state of disuse.

The zoo staff on condition of anonymity told Dawn that it was almost nine years
since an animal had been treated at the hospital and that too by a visiting vet.

Presently, the zoo with more than 800 mammals and birds has only one
veterinarian and three zoologists, two of them hired on contract basis in recent
years.

Top zoo officials, the director and the additional director, have no academic
qualification in zoology or professional experience in animal care. Besides,
there has been no move by the KMC to upgrade the status of animal-keepers who
spend most of the time with animals.

The KMC hires both zoo-keepers and sweepers in grade one and their posts require
no specific training or qualification except that they should be healthy
individuals.

There has been no new induction of zoo-keepers since 1997, though many have
either retired, left the job or passed away. The other upsetting thing is that
most zoo employees have been awaiting promotion for a long time, revealed a zoo
staff.

To support his point, he gave the example of a senior colleague, Karamat Masih,
who recently retired as zoo-keeper in grade one after serving the facility for
30 years. Same was the case with Deen Mohammad, who retired as a gardener last
year after 40 years of service.

According to sources, the KMC has no practice of providing technical training to
its staff posted at facilities for captive animals. Two members of the zoo
staff, however, received training in handling foot-and-mouth disease cases in
May this year. The training was organised by the Food and Agriculture
Organisation as part of a national project.

This happened for the first time in decades. We want to learn and polish our
skills. Unfortunately, there are no avenues, another zoo official said.

In the absence of technical staff, lack of training and funding constraints,
it's not surprising that the zoo has failed to perform its basic purpose -
conservation of wildlife species. With high mortality and injury rates, the zoo
has no breeding programme for endangered species to boast of while many animals
die after spending a solitary life.

We don't have the technical staff to run the health facility. Diseased and
injured animals are treated in their cages since renovation of the quarantine
isn't complete yet, said assistant director of the zoo Dr Aamir Ismail.

He refused to show the mortality data book of the zoo, arguing that no zoo in
the world would do so.

Additional director zoo Syed Aqeel Tazeem Naqvi, who holds a foreign diploma in
gardening, admitted that the zoo lacked technical staff and said that requests
for the same had been made to the authorities.

If technical staff is hired, given financial powers and a long tenure to serve,
there is no reason that the zoo can't show progress, he said, adding that the
relevant officials had also been informed about the need to make the hospital
functional.

Bouygues secures contract to build two buildings at Hautepierre Hospital in
France

LENGTH: 256 words


To be designed by Ingerop and developed by Groupe 6, the project includes
construction of two buildings, out of which one will be a regional cancer
institute and the other a medico-technical and locomotor facility.

Both the buildings will be connected to each other and to an existing structure
through underground passages and pedestrian bridges.

Occupying a surface area of 30,000m², the eight-storey regional cancer institute
will house a radiotherapy unit equipped with seven bunkers for particle
accelerators, a nuclear medicine unit, a 122-bed conventional hospital block, a
38-bed specialist hospital unit, and 72-bed oncology and haematology day
hospitals.

The 11-floor medico-technical and locomotor facility will be built on an area of
around 41,000m².

This building will feature an arrivals area, logistical platform, a central
sterilization unit, a 164-seat lecture theatre equipped with conference rooms,
an area for external consultations in disciplines not covered at the facility,
and an extension of the site's imaging unit.

Also, two surgical units with 15 and 17 theatres respectively, a 30-bed
day-surgery hospital, a continuous monitoring unit with 16 beds, six
conventional hospital units each with 28 beds, and associated offices and
support services will be available at the facility.

Pertuy Construction will oversee structural work, walls and covering, drywall,
finishing work, roadways and infrastructural networks.

Work on the site is slated to begin in early July 2014 and is expected to take
42 months to complete.

Arunachal to get first private university

SECTION: GUWAHATI

LENGTH: 450 words


ITANAGAR: Arunachal Pradesh is all set get its maiden private university -
Indira Gandhi Technical & Medical Sciences University - which will start
functioning at Ziro, headquarters of Lower Subansiri district, from next month.
Chief minister Nabam Tuki will formally inaugurate the varsity on July 6 next,
official sources informed here on Wednesday.

The first private university of the state, set up in the
public-private-partnership (PPP) mode, is the outcome of an act passed by the
state legislative assembly in March this year.

P R Trivedi, chancellor of the varsity, who along with director Arvind Kumar
Das, called on the chief minister at his office here last evening, informed Tuki
of the proposed inaugural function that would commemorate the Dree celebrations.

All the formalities, including placement of the endowment fund of Rs 3 crore,
have been completed in accordance with the act. Besides, a site measuring 150
hectare has been acquired for establishment of the university, which was donated
voluntarily by the villagers of Hong in the picturesque Apatani valley. Trivedi
requested Tuki to facilitate adoption of the Ziro District Hospital by the
university under a joint-venture project with a view to strengthen rural and
urban medical facilities.

He said once the hospital is adopted by the varsity, it would be equipped with
all necessary equipment and modern facilities and cater to the needs of patients
from all the neighboring districts, particularly Kurung Kumey and Upper
Subansiri.

He said the hospital would be equipped with the latest medical gadgets and
equipment like a CT scanner and an MRI scanner besides ultrasound, blood
chemistry and parametric machines.

Trivedi further said that the varsity has decided to immediately launch
bachelor's and master's degree programmes in the fields of medical laboratory
technology, nursing, optometry, radiology, imaging technology, hospital
management, hotel management, catering technology, information technology,
business administration, disaster management etc.

There are also plans to launch the first batch of BTech and MTech in
hydro-electric and power engineering from the next academic session. The
university has already submitted a proposal to the Medical Council of India
(MCI) to start MBBS course.

On a query of the chief minister, Trivedi assured him that maximum benefit would
percolate down to the locals by way of employment as well as technical
education.

Tuki appreciated the promptness of the varsity authorities in clearing the
formalities as per the norms laid down in the act and expressed optimism that
the institution would fill the void in technical education in the state.

Peshawarites suffer as protest causes logjams on roads

SECTION: Vol. 70 No. 323

LENGTH: 534  words


The roads in Peshawar city witnessed the worst traffic mess when non-technical
employees of health department went on strike to demand professional allowance.

The members of Paramedical Association (Class-IV) belonging to different
districts gathered at Jinnah Park from where they marched towards the provincial
assembly building. The protest caused logjams on all roads in the city.

Later, Provincial Minister for Finance Muzaffar Said met the protesting
employees and accepted their demand of granting them health professional
allowance. The protest ended after people faced great hardships on roads for no
fault of theirs.

The government employees are in the habit of coming on roads for petty matters,
without thinking about ensuing problems for the people visiting the provincial
capital from all over the province.

Minister promises health dept employees allowance

Bumper-to-bumper vehicular traffic also made it difficult for the ambulances to
pass by.

Addressing the protesters, Nabi Ameen, president of the association, said that
19,583 staffers of health department had been left out of the allowance. He said
that they were also at risk like other employees and deserved to be given the
allowance.

"There is growing unrest among the non-technical employees including IT
technicians, maintenance staff, electricians, ward orderlies and sweepers. They
are part and parcel of the hospitals and demand equal rights for all the
employees," said Mr Ameen.

He said that the minister had assured them of granting them health professional
allowance within a week. He said that they would again take to the streets if
the minister didn't fulfil his promise.

Mr Ameen said that they also risked their lives while performing duty.
Deprivation of Class-IV employees of the allowance had created unrest among the
members of the association. He said that they were ready to render any sacrifice
for getting the allowance. "However, we called off the strike after the
assurance of the minister," he added.

Enraged by the road blockade, the commuters and motorists cursed the protesters
and also criticised government for its failure to prevent people from creating
obstacle in smooth flow of traffic. Patients in local hospitals also faced
inconvenience owing to absence of technical staff but operation theatres,
laboratory, radiology and emergency departments operated as usual.

In teaching hospitals, attendants themselves shifted their patients on
stretchers from OPD to wards and operation theatre. They also worked as ward
orderlies and gatekeepers in the hospitals during the course of the protest.

Senior officials said that the non-technical staff didn't fulfil prescribed
criteria for entitlement to health professional allowance. They said that only
doctors, nurses and paramedics were entitled to the allowance as they came into
contact with all sorts of patients and were vulnerable to infections.

However, the protesters believed that they would get something out of the
protest. In the past, the building of provincial assembly had seen similar
protests by doctors, nurse and paramedics to be able to get health professional
allowance. The Class-IV employees have taken the same path to get the allowance.

CDA technical committee gives nod to three projects

LENGTH: 427  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


The technical committee of Capital Development Authority (CDA), which met here
on Tuesday, gave nod to three projects including development of Park Enclave and
expansion and upgradation of cardiac centre and operation theatre of the
CDA-owned Capital Hospital.



The committee during the meeting chaired by Chairman Maroof Afzal approved the
construction of state-of-the-art cardiac centre at CDA Hospital. The cardiac
centre will be constructed at a cost of Rs190 million including cost of
machinery, other allied equipment and staff. State-of-the-art cardiac centre
will be equipped with all latest facilities. It was informed that CDA spends
Rs25 million on cardiac patients who are referred to other hospitals due to
non-availability of these facilities at CDA Hospital. After the establishment of
this modern cardiac centre, CDA would not only save Rs25 million, but also earn
a handsome amount by treating the private patients. The meeting also decided
that operation theatre at the CDA Hospital would be upgraded, expanded and
modernised according to present time needs.

In this regard it was decided that the operation theatre at CDA Hospital would
be upgraded and expanded to enable it to conduct four operations simultaneously.


The technical committee in Tuesday's meeting also approved in principle to
provide all facilities to the allottees of Park Enclave Housing Project as
committed in the brochures at the time of launch of the housing scheme. The
Rs3.68 PC-1 for development of the Park Enclave would also be approved soon.

It may be pointed here that former chairman Nadeem Hasan Asif had ordered to
exclude many attractive features of the project with directives to reduce the
PC-1 from Rs3.68 billion to Rs1.7 billion.

Meanwhile, on the directions of CDA Chairman Maroof Afzal, CDA has launched a
special campaign against the non-confirming use of residential areas in
different sectors of Islamabad.

Responding to the complaints of Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry
different trade associations, the CDA chairman has constituted a team to launch
this operation. The team consists of Director Municipal Administration (DMA),
Assistant Commissioner (City) ICT, Deputy Director Building Control Section
(BCS) and Deputy Director Trade License DMA.

The spokesman further said that this team has started working from Tuesday and
visited F-6 and F-7 sectors to serve notices to all violators.

The CDA chairman has directed the team to take action across the board without
any fear or favour. This operation will be extended to the whole city.

More St. Joseph Hospital workers vote to unionize

BYLINE: By Aaron West awest@times-standard.com Technical workers at St. Joseph
Hospital in Eureka voted to unionize late last month, amid concerns that their
benefits were being unfairly cut and their best i

SECTION: NEWS; Local

LENGTH: 790 words


The vote, which passed among the hospital's 84 tech workers by a 4-to-1 margin
on Nov. 20, according to a National Union of Healthcare Workers release, follows
a similar decision made last April when more than 200 of the hospital's service
employees voted in favor of joining a union.

And the reasons that drove the service workers' vote last spring   having a
voice at the table, negotiating wage increases and receiving fair benefits   are
the same as now, according to pharmacy technicians at the hospital, as well as
Charlie Ridgell, chief negotiator for St. Joseph's union negotiations in Eureka.

"If you don't have a union, an employer can do whatever they want," Ridgell
said. "It's you as an individual bargaining with a big company, and you don't
have any leverage. As an individual, what are you going to do? You can say, 'If
you don't give me a big raise I'm going to quit,' and the employer will ask you
which door you'd like to use."

Ridgell said that typically both the service and technical divisions would
unionize at the same time   like they're currently discussing at Redwood
Memorial Hospital in Fortuna   but when the service workers voted last spring,
the technical workers couldn't quite garner the support. Then, after a
system-wide memo stating employees who weren't part of a union would have
certain benefits cut was sent out, Ridgell said more technical workers got on
board.

"In August, (the hospital) imposed unilateral cuts on anyone who didn't have a
union," he said, specifying that the hospital eliminated certain benefits
surrounding the amount of paid time off employees received, as well as
post-retirement benefits and extended sick leave.

"When they imposed the cuts the employer put out a memo that said 'anyone who
doesn't have a union   you're getting these cuts,'" he said.

Tech workers at the hospital include positions like pharmacy techs and X-ray
techs. Service jobs include positions in housekeeping and food service.

On the hospital's part, St. Joseph and Redwood Memorial hospitals President
David O'Brien said the benefit cuts were carefully studied and made in
accordance with larger changes in the health care system.

"There were some benefit adjustments across the health system, and the ones that
were done here came after a review of benefits across the country," O'Brien
said. "(The cuts) didn't involve pay reductions or loss of medical benefits, and
I don't want to minimize it, but fortunately we haven't had to make major
changes in other areas."

In regard to unions, O'Brien added that the hospital administration would prefer
to deal with its employees directly, but that it supports the employees'
decision.

"Our preference is to have a direct relationship with our employees whenever
possible," he said. "But we respect our employees' rights to be represented by a
union, and if that's their choice we respect that and we'll work positively and
collaboratively going forward."

For the pharmacy technicians, that may involve getting some of their benefits
back   which Ridgell said could be part of future negotiations once a contract
is signed   as well as wage increases.

Adam Dozier, who has worked for the hospital for six years, described wage
increases there as "minimal."

"When I got hired, they told us there would be no wage increases for a number of
years and that was just kind of the status quo." Dozier said. "I can't speak for
all departments, and I don't know how it was elsewhere, but for me, the wage
increases over the past six years have been minimal. I'm from a place where you
can go to the boss and say 'Hey I've been working hard for a couple years,' and
they at least think about the request. Here we haven't even been given a chance
for a fair evaluation."

Information on how many raises hospital technicians have received over the past
six years wasn't immediately available, but the most recent raise   a 2 percent
wage increase   came in October, Dozier said.

"To me a 2 percent raise doesn't really help me out a lot," he said. "If I'm
making 20 bucks an hour, I'm getting what, like 45 cents more? If I was going to
go to my boss and ask for a raise I'd ask for at least a dollar more, if I
deserved it. It just doesn't seem employees are evaluated on their actual
skills."

O'Brien said the hospital values its employees and that he'd worked side-by-side
with cafeteria staff, as well as attended nearly 40 workshops in the past few
months, in order to discuss the hospital's mission and the purpose of its work.

"I've done quite a bit of job shadowing and working in various departments,
spending time with people." O'Brien said. "We have some of the best people
working for us. I'm very proud of them and the work that they do."

Boy dies, sister injured in flats fire in Dublin

BYLINE: By ALISON HEALY

SECTION: CITY EDITION; HOME NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 331 words


Three-year-old Clayton Maher, has died and his twin sister, Kim, is in a
critical condition, following a fire in a flat in Dublin city centre early
yesterday morning.

Garda and fire investigation officers were still trying to establish the cause
of the fire last night but early indications were that it was accidental.

The emergency services were alerted at 4.20 a.m. when the fire broke out in a
bedroom of the three-storey flat in Ross Road, close to Christchurch in Dublin
8.

The three-year-old twins were rescued from the flat in a critical condition and
taken to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. Clayton died at about
1 p.m. yesterday. Kim remained critically ill last night.

Their six-year-old sister, Chelsea, was taken to Temple Street Hospital
suffering from smoke inhalation and serious injuries.

The children's 24-year-old mother, Ms Tracey Maher and their babysitter were
taken to St James's Hospital, also suffering from smoke inhalation.

Neighbours tried to rescue the family before six units of the Dublin Fire
Brigade arrived.

Fire fighters brought the blaze under control in about two hours.

One fireman received facial injuries during the incident and needed medical
treatment.

The scene was preserved for a technical examination yesterday. A fire brigade
spokesman said investigators were examining the scene to determine the cause of
the fire.

Forensic officers from the Garda Technical Bureau were also investigated the
scene.

While foul play was not ruled out, nothing was found to indicate suspicious
circumstances.

The fire did not spread to other flats in the building.

Meanwhile, garda in Newbridge are still investigating the cause of the fire in
which Newbridge Courthouse was burned down last week.

Samples of the debris have been removed from the scene and are being examined
for traces of accelerant.

A Garda spokesman said it could be several days before the cause of the fire was
determined.

State award to reroof on Colonial Park

- The state has awarded the Brimfield Housing Authority $225,000 to put a new
roof on the Colonial Park apartments behind Town Hall.

The grant from the state Division of Housing and Community Development was
announced yesterday by area legislators. State Rep. Reed V. Hillman,
R-Sturbridge, said a visit last month by the division's director, Jane Wallis
Gumble, paid off for the 56-unit complex for elderly and disabled tenants.

Two in critical condition after I-84 crash

STURBRIDGE -- Two men in a pickup truck involved in a two-vehicle accident
Monday on Interstate 84 were listed in critical condition yesterday at UMass
Memorial Medical Center, University Campus, according to a nursing supervisor.

State police yesterday released the names of the men: Seong Keat Chen, 25, and
Song Ken Chin, 31, both of New York City.

A language problem had caused a delay in reaching the next of kin of the men.

The crash closed the highway for about five hours. The men were passengers in a
Nissan pickup driven by Meng Foo Chai, 41, also of New York City. Mr. Chai was
treated at Harrington Memorial Hospital in Southbridge and released.

Samson D. Yohannes, 22, of Waltham was listed as the driver of a Ford Probe that
collided with the truck. He also was taken to UMass, according to Trooper John
Puccia, investigating officer. A hospital spokesman, however, said there was no
record of Mr. Yohannes receiving any treatment.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.

Grant commissioners trying to keep EMS service available to county residents -
Part Two: Hospital can no longer afford to provide the service

BYLINE: Mona Ridder, Cumberland Times News, Md.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 631 words


Jun. 29--Editor's note: This story is the second in a three-part series on West
Virgnia medical services.

PETERSBURG, W.Va. -- In 1975, the West Virginia Legislature passed a bill
obligating county commissions to provide emergency ambulance service to all
residents of the county unless there is no money to provide such service.

The counties had five options:

--To provide service directly through their agents and employees.

--Through private enterprise.

--By contracting with individuals, groups, associations and corporations.

--Through an authority.

--Do nothing.

In response to the legislation, counties throughout the region began looking at
how they could provide service.

A number of counties, including Mineral and Grant, chose to create an ambulance
authority.

Mineral County continues to operate seven volunteer emergency medical services
squads through its authority funded by an excess levy that generates about
$172,000 for the authority. Only one of the eight squads uses any paid
personnel. The squads also bill for services.

Grant County formed its authority in early 1978. At some point shortly after
that, it was reported that the authority was disbanded by the county commission.
Without evidence to support that report, the authority still exists legally,
according to a Technical Assistance Team Report provided to the county in early
2007.

While other counties in the state are looking at how to provide service
utilizing more paid personnel because of the reduced number of available
volunteers in recent years, Grant County's paid personnel are faced with losing
their jobs because their employer, Grant County Memorial Hospital, can no longer
afford to provide the service.

A technical assistance team was formed by the West Virginia EMS Technical
Support Network on behalf of the state Department of Health and Human Resources
to study the history, current status and future of Grant County's EMS efforts.

The team made several suggestions, including to maintain the status quo, which
hospital officials say is not an option and doing nothing, which the county
commissioners said is not an option.

Hospital representative Sandy Michaels said the cost of maintaining the service
is too great.

"There was a (hospital) board vote that the county take over the service or
reimburse the hospital $300,000 a year," she said.

County Coordinator Cindy Whetsell said the county commission does not have the
money to fund the service and an excess levy is not likely an option for voters
in the county.

County commission president Charlie Goldizen said the commission recognizes the
service is an essential one and the county officials want to find a way to make
the service available to county residents.

He also said he does not want to ask citizens to pay more through a levy.

One option the county is looking at is contracting with providers for the
service.

Jim Cosner, manager of the Fraley Ambulance Service in Moorefield, Hardy County,
said the Grant County commissioners approached the service informally to see if
it would be interested in expanding into the Maysville/Petersburg area.

He said Fraley's is a combination paid/volunteer squad that serves most of the
western portion of Hardy County. He followed up by calling a meeting and
inviting people who might be interested in serving with an expanded squad.

Human, technical errors to blame for Afghan hospital strike: NYT

LENGTH: 488  words


US forces who launched an air strike on an Afghan hospital last month intended
to attack a nearby Taliban-controlled compound, military officials told American
media, citing an investigation set to blame human and technical error for the
deadly strike.

The October 3 air raid on a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hospital in the
Taliban-held northern city of Kunduz killed at least 30 people, sparked an
avalanche of global condemnation and forced the French charity to close the
hospital.

Two military officials told the New York Times Tuesday that a combination of
human and technical errors meant that a Special Operations AC-130 gunship
aircraft hit the hospital instead of an Afghan intelligence compound hundreds of
feet away that was thought to have been commandeered by Taliban fighters.

The gunship's crew relied on location information relayed to them by US and
Afghan special forces rather than their aircraft's instruments, according to the
officials, who discussed the report on condition of anonymity ahead of its
formal release.

The findings will be officially announced by US General John Campbell at Nato
headquarters in Kabul at 7:00pm on Wednesday (1430 GMT).

The officials' account as quoted by the NYT does not address why the attack
which lasted more than one hour  was not halted despite frantic telephone calls
from MSF staff, nor why US ground forces failed to intervene when they saw the
wrong building being hit.

One official told the Times the crew did not receive a full preflight briefing
that would have told them the Kunduz hospital was protected under the Geneva
Convention.

The US military also failed to follow its own rules of engagement for calling
air strikes  that American or Afghan troops must be in extreme danger  while the
Special Operations Forces did not positively identify that the area targeted was
legitimate, the paper said.

"There was certainly some confusion over what they were shooting at," an
official told the Wall Street Journal, which received a similar briefing. "If
there wasn't, then this wouldn't have happened."

The US military offered a series of shifting explanations for the bombing raid
before President Barack Obama admitted in a call to MSF chief Joanne Liu that
the strike was a mistake and apologised.

A Nato statement released hours after the attack on Saturday, October 3 would
not confirm the hospital was targeted, characterising it instead as "collateral
damage" as Afghan forces came under fire. The next day the US confirmed the
hospital was hit directly, but did not offer further details.

Later General Campbell suggested that Afghan forces had called in the strike,
before offering a fourth account in four days admitting US special forces had
been in touch with the aircraft.

Nato and the Afghan army are conducting their own investigations. MSF has called
for an independent international investigation, saying the attack could be
determined to be a "war crime".

Penrose-St. Francis Hospital is one of 45 hospitals in Colorado that is
participating in the "5 Million Lives Campaign," a nationwide effort designed to
curtail practices that lead to patient injuries and death.

To support the nationwide effort, designed by the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement, the Colorado Trust has given participating Colorado hospitals and
support groups grants totaling $3.9 million.

The 45 acute-care hospitals received grants averaging $40,000 to participate in
the campaign. An additional $255,000 will provide resources for staff at
participating hospitals to attend learning and networking events throughout the
18-month campaign. Additionally, $5,000 grants from The Colorado Trust are
available to the state's 29 other hospitals to participate in educational
programs and technical assistance training.

The Colorado Hospital Association will receive $90,000 to work with
participating hospitals' CEOs and boards of directors to provide professional
development and leadership training.

The Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, the state's health care quality
improvement organization, will receive $535,000 to share knowledge among the
hospitals and provide technical assistance support to the hospitals. As
components of this technical assistance, the Colorado Rural Health Center will
work with participating hospitals to address rural patient safety issues and
help hospitals develop communications that support the spread and sustainability
of interventions among staff and patients.

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement will receive $120,000 to support
professional development for hospital front-line providers and quality
improvement directors focused on the science of improvement.

The campaign will implement systems and safeguards that prevent problems such as
hospital-acquired infections, adverse drug events, surgical errors, pressure
ulcers and other complications.

The effort is to prevent 5 million incidents that could cause patient harm or
death during a two-year period.

The grants build on the success of the 100,000 Lives Campaign, the institute's
first effort to assist hospitals with patient safety protocols by instituting
six improvement practices within hospitals. The campaign exceeded its goal -
participating hospitals across the country saved an estimated 122,300 lives by
implementing changes in patient care recommended by IHI and other initiatives.

In Colorado, the trust supported 62 hospitals during the campaign, representing
96 percent of all hospital beds in the state.

The new campaign will add six improvement practices, including the first
non-clinical intervention focused on greater trustee engagement and
accountability for reducing medical harm.

Hospitals adopt 12 interventions to improve care, with the goal of protecting
patients from 5 million incidents of harm.

The interventions include rapid response at the first sign of patient decline,
making certain that patients receive the right medications at every transfer
point in care, adherence to best practices known to prevent heart attacks and
ventilator-associated pneumonia, reduction of infections and drug-resistant
staph, reduction of bed sores and incorporating hospital leadership into patient
safety efforts.

Aetna provides cost information

In the age of increased transparency in health care, one insurance company is
providing more information about the costs of several surgical procedures.

Aetna has a Web-based resource that allows members to compare the cost ranges
for services provided at specific facilities.

The site shows a range for the costs of more than 30 common procedures -
including colonoscopies and hysterectomies - from admission through discharge.
This includes the facility charges, physician fees and any supplementary charges
such as anesthesia services.

Aetna started offering physician-specific pricing information two years ago.

Research shows that consumers vastly underestimate the cost of health care. For
example, the average consumer believes that a day in the hospital costs a little
more than $1,000 - the actual cost is three times that amount.

Surveys also show that the majority of Americans are demanding specific cost
information, with more than 80 percent indicating that hospitals and physicians
should be required to disclose the cost of medical services to the public.

The Web site also provides physician-specific clinical quality and efficiency
information, as well as price transparency.

Partnership's bid for nursing college moves a step forward

SECTION: AGENCY:MEDIA; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 393  words


A BID for a  technical college   to address a shortage of nurses in the county
is expected to be lodged with the Government by this autumn.

Gloucester MP Richard Graham has highlighted the city's interest in hosting  a
pilot project which  could see 1,000 new nursing associates trained in
Gloucestershire.

The new role would be an alternative   route to become a registered nurse and
aims to bridge the gap between healthcare support workers, who have a care
certificate, and registered nurses with degrees.

The University of Gloucestershire is working with Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust to launch the bid for a University Technical College.

If the bid is successful, the aim would be to welcome the first intake of
students at the technical college in September 2019.

Mr Graham, pictured,  said:  "I've no doubt that if our university is approved
to offer pre-registration courses and then run a major pilot scheme for nursing
associates in Gloucestershire, that would make a huge difference to the shortage
of nurses in both city and county.

"Degrees aren't for everyone, so this higher apprenticeship will give everyone
the opportunity to get a qualification and work in the health sector which is
our biggest employer here in Gloucester."

NHS hospitals in Gloucestershire have launched drives to recruit new nurses this
year.

The technical college plans come after the Government scrapped bursaries for new
student nurses and midwives in England from 2017. They will  have to apply for
a student loan.

Stephen Marston, the University of Gloucestershire's vice-chancellor, said:
"Given the importance of the health service, we are keen to work with the
hospitals trust and other NHS partners to help ensure they can recruit the staff
they need to provide excellent patient care.

"A technical college could provide a great way of enabling 14 to 18-year-olds to
gain both an excellent education and a wider experience."

Nursing associates  will be drafted in to provide hands-on care allowing nurses
to spend more time on their clinical duties.

They would be trained in a more vocational way through on-the-job experience via
an apprenticeship leading to a foundation degree.

A survey by the public service union Unison last year showed nine out of  10
student nurses would not have applied for a nursing degree without having
bursaries available.

supervises the Lakeland effort.

Cindy Sternlicht, public relations director for Lakeland Regional, said the
hospital is "committed to having a factual and informational campaign."

Employees have the right to choose, she said.

The technical category includes licensed practical nurses, radiologic
technologists, CT technologists, vascular technologists, catheterization lab
technologists, ultrasound technologists, nuclear medicine technologists,
radiation therapy technologists, respiratory care practitioners, registered
respiratory therapists, operating room technicians, cytology technicians,
histology technicians, medical laboratory technicians, physical therapy
assistants, paramedics, biomedical equipment technicians and biomedical
equipment control technicians.

In April 1997, registered nurses approved having the union represent them in
collective bargaining. They approved a two-year contract in November 1998.

While the union was organizing registered nurses, union supporters distributed
fliers outside the hospital. This time, no outside demonstrations are planned.

The union is being allowed to provide information in the cafeteria from 7 a.m.-7
p.m., Sternlicht said. Both sides predict an election in April.

Sternlicht and Harris said the current campaign won't become a referendum on how
the union represents registered nurses.

"It's not going to be as adversarial as it was," Harris said. "It's going to be
a somewhat friendly campaign."

Tarakais set up hospital, college in Swabi

LENGTH: 165  words

DATELINE: PESHAWAR


PESHAWAR, Sept. 17 -- The Tarakai family has established a welfare hospital and
a technical college in Swabi for the poor residents of the district and both the
projects would be inaugurated on Monday.

According to MPA Javed Khan Tarakai, the Liaqat Tarakai Welfare Trust has
established the hospital at a cost of Rs80 million to treat poor patients while
Rs20 million had been spent to construct a technical college for imparting
professional training to local youth.

"During my election campaign, I had made three promises with the people that
included winning status of subdivision for the area, setting up of a charity
hospital and a technical college. I have fulfilled two of my promises while
efforts are being made to achieve subdivision status for my area, Razar," said

Patients - a real virtue in biomedical innovation; Research Monthly; Business
Spinoffs

BYLINE: JENNY GRISTOCK

LENGTH: 600 words


Government science policies focus on developing links with industry but that is
not the only place fruits of academic research can be applied. Jenny Gristock
reports

A hidden research network based on United Kingdom hospitals that could be as
important for innovation as collaborations between business and academia has
been uncovered by researchers Diana Hicks and Sylvan Katz of the Science Policy
Research Unit.

Hicks and Katz call this web of links, neglected by analysts and in government
policy, the biomedical innovation system. Within it, collaborative partnerships
involving UK hospitals, medical research institutes, non-profit organisations
and research councils stimulate exploitation of the science base.

The duo developed a database, using information from co-authored papers to track
research links in science. By looking at patterns of co-authoring in papers
published in the 1980s, they have found two groups of sectors that collaborated
with each other more than expected. In the first group, researchers from
government, industry and universities were seen to be working together. In the
second, authors from hospitals, some medical research institutes, non-profit
organisations and research councils collaborated.

The researchers say that companies, as 'sites of application' of research, seek
to link up with sources of technical opportunity - universities and government
laboratories. Similarly, hospitals make connections with sources of biomedical
technical opportunity: non-profit organisations, certain research institutes
(special health authorities and institutes of the former British Postgraduate
Medical Federation Institutes), research councils and universities.

The researchers distinguish between hospitals and universities, despite the fact
that many hospitals are attached to universities, because 'doctors can't be
trained from textbooks and blackboards alone'. The crucial element of patient
contact gives hospitals a separate identity, which defines them as both users
and sources of technical opportunity.

'Most analyses of interactions between users and sources of technical
opportunity examine only industrial collaborations,' says Katz, a senior fellow
at SPRU. 'This is unfortunate because the biomedical system is quite different:
hospitals contribute more substantially to the science base than companies, and,
of course, biomedical research needs access to patients.'

Hicks and Katz point out that while hospitals use research results to improve
treatment, universities rarely apply the results of their research internally.

They illustrate this using a parallel with engineering departments. 'Sometimes
engineering training is said to be inadequate. But if engineering departments
were intermingled with companies to help their students solve real-world
problems, those companies would not become universities,' say Hicks and Katz.

Hospitals, special health authorities and postgraduate medical institutions are
responsible for approximately a quarter of all British scientific output. The
SPRU research indicates that the hidden biomedical research network to which
they belong stimulates the innovative application of British science, but their
contribution to the UK's capacity to innovate is not well understood. 'The 1993
white paper, Realising Our Potential, doesn't even mention them,' says Katz. And
yet, he points out, the role played by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori in
causing stomach ulcers, a major surprise in recent medical discovery, was
uncovered by a medical doctor working in a hospital.

   Emergent Group Inc. (Emergent) is the parent company of PRI Medical
Technologies, Inc., its wholly owned and primary operating subsidiary (PRI
Medical). PRI Medical is a provider of surgical equipment on a fee for service
basis to hospitals, surgical care centers and other healthcare providers. PRI
Medical serves both large and small healthcare providers, including smaller
independent hospitals and physicians, and larger, well-financed hospitals. PRI
Medical also provides its technicians to support hospital-owned surgical
equipment on a fee for service basis. In May 2009, the Company acquired New York
Cryosurgery Equipment LLC, which provides mobile cryosurgery equipment and
technicians to hospitals for treatment of prostate and renal cancer.

   PRI Medical makes mobile surgical services available to its customers by
providing mobile lasers and other surgical equipment on a per procedure basis to
hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, and physician offices along with
technical support and disposable supplies required to utilize the equipment. PRI
Medical' s mobile surgical services focus on primarily surgical care. Physicians
perform surgeries at hospitals or surgery centers by renting PRI Medical' s
laser or other equipment and receive PRI Medical' s technical support and
capabilities that is provided with the equipment. As of December 31, 2009, PRI
Medical had approximately 800 active accounts in 16 states. The market
encompasses many disciplines, including general surgery, orthopedic surgery,
otolaryngology, urology, obstetrics, gynecology, podiatry, dermatology, and
plastic/cosmetics. It has acquired the assets of Surgical Services Division (the
Services Division) of PhotoMedex, Inc. The Services Division provides mobile
laser services in 11 Northeast, Middle Atlantic and Southeast states, serving 18
individual local markets, expanding PRI' s geographic coverage to a total of 16
states.

   PRI Medical' s technicians provide surgical equipment and related technical
services support to physicians and operating room personnel in hospitals,
surgical care centers and other health-related facilities on a per-procedure
basis. Mobile surgical services are ordered from 24 hours to several months in
advance of surgery, and re-confirmed with the customer the day before the
medical procedure by PRI Medical' s scheduling department. Upon arrival at the
customer site, PRI Medical' s technician set up the equipment, posts required
warning notices outside the operating room, issues safety equipment to the
operating room staff, provides any disposable materials needed, and supplies
equipment certifications and/or documentation required for hospital record
keeping. Technician-only services are also made available to hospitals and
surgery facilities.

   PRI Medical' s equipment encompasses carbon dioxide (CO2), neodymium yttrium
aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), pulse dye, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)/YAG,
diode, Greenlight HPS, holmium YAG, lithotripsy and cryosurgery technology. PRI
Medical also provides its customers with disposable products and/or ancillary
equipment that are needed for a given medical procedure. The revenue from
disposable products is primarily related to laser and cryosurgery equipment
rentals requiring fibers, probes, and disposable kits proprietary to a specific
manufacturer' s equipment.

   The Company competes with Healthtronics.

Human, technical errors to blame for Afghan hospital strike

LENGTH: 462 words

DATELINE: Kabul


Kabul, Nov. 26 -- US forces who launched an air strike on an Afghan hospital
last month intended to attack a nearby Taliban-controlled compound, military
officials told American media, citing an investigation set to blame human and
technical error for the deadly strike.

The October 3 air raid on a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hospital in the
Taliban-held northern city of Kunduz killed at least 30 people, sparked an
avalanche of global condemnation and forced the French charity to close the
hospital.

Two military officials told the New York Times yesterday that a combination of
human and technical errors meant that a Special Operations AC-130 gunship
aircraft hit the hospital instead of an Afghan intelligence compound hundreds of
feet away that was thought to have been commandeered by Taliban fighters.

The gunship's crew relied on location information relayed to them by US and
Afghan special forces rather than their aircraft's instruments, according to the
officials, who discussed the report on condition of anonymity ahead of its
formal release.

The findings will be officially announced by US General John Campbell at NATO
headquarters in Kabul at 7.00 pm today (1430 GMT).

The officials' account as quoted by the NYT does not address why the attack -
which lasted more than one hour - was not halted despite frantic telephone calls
from MSF staff, nor why US ground forces failed to intervene when they saw the
wrong building being hit.

One official told the Times the crew did not receive a full preflight briefing
that would have told them the Kunduz hospital was protected under the Geneva
Convention.

The US military also failed to follow its own rules of engagement for calling
air strikes - that American or Afghan troops must be in extreme danger - while
the Special Operations Forces did not positively identify that the area targeted
was legitimate, the paper said.

"There was certainly some confusion over what they were shooting at," an
official told the Wall Street Journal, which received a similar briefing. "If
there wasn't, then this wouldn't have happened."

The US military offered a series of shifting explanations for the bombing raid
before President Barack Obama admitted in a call to MSF chief Joanne Liu that
the strike was a mistake and apologised.

A NATO statement released hours after the attack on Saturday, October 3 would
not confirm the hospital was targeted, characterising it instead as "collateral
damage" as Afghan forces came under fire.

The next day the US confirmed the hospital was hit directly, but did not offer
further details.

Nonga move a big worry

BYLINE: By GRACE TIDEN

SECTION: HOME NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 203 words


A LEADER in East New Britain Province has called on authorities to speed up the
relocation of Nonga General Hospital due to the continuous ash fall from
volcanic Mt Tavurvur.

Toma/Vunadidir Local Level Government president David Piamia also questioned
when a technical team would be established in the province to organise the
relocation of the hospital.

An initial funding of K9 million had been made available for the relocation of
the hospital to the Toma/Vunadidir LLG area under the National Government s
Supplementary Budget.

The ENB provincial executive council had made the decision some years ago to
relocate the hospital due to the continuous spewing of ash and dust from Mt
Tavurvur.

The hospital has been subjected to corrosion and rust.

It is costly to maintain and the present location was also regarded as risky for
patients.

The ENB Health adviser Bernard Lukara had said they were still waiting for a
technical task force at the Department of Health level to be set up.

Mr Piamia said his people were ready to sell their land to the provincial
government for the building of the hospital.

He called on the Health Minister Sasa Zibe and his secretary to immediately set
up a technical team so work could start.

Partnership's bid for nursing college moves a step forward;
HEALTH NHS and uni working together to fill skills gap

BYLINE: Matt Discombe

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 390 words


BID for a technical college to address a shortage of nurses in the county is
expected to be lodged with the Government by this autumn.

AGloucester MP Richard Graham has highlighted the city's interest in hosting a
pilot project which could see 1,000 new nursing associates trained in
Gloucestershire.

The new role would be an alternative route to become a registered nurse and aims
to bridge the gap between healthcare support workers, who have a care
certificate, and registered nurses with degrees.

The University of Gloucestershire is working with Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust to launch the bid for a University Technical College.

If the bid is successful, the aim would be to welcome the first intake of
students at the technical college in September 2019.

Mr Graham, pictured, said: "I've no doubt that if our university is approved to
offer pre-registration courses and then run a major pilot scheme for nursing
associates in Gloucestershire, that would make a huge difference to the shortage
of nurses in both city and county.

"Degrees aren't for everyone, so this higher apprenticeship will give everyone
the opportunity to get a qualification and work in the health sector which is
our biggest employer here in Gloucester." NHS hospitals in Gloucestershire have
launched drives to recruit new nurses this year.

The technical college plans come after the Government scrapped bursaries for new
student nurses and midwives in England from 2017. They will have to apply for a
student loan.

Stephen Marston, the University of Gloucestershire's vice-chancellor, said:
"Given the importance of the health service, we are keen to work with the
hospitals trust and other NHS partners to help ensure they can recruit the staff
they need to provide excellent patient care.

"A technical college could provide a great way of enabling 14 to 18-year-olds to
gain both an excellent education and a wider experience."

Nursing associates will be drafted in to provide hands-on care allowing nurses
to spend more time on their clinical duties. They would be trained in a more
vocational way through on-the-job experience via an apprenticeship leading to a
foundation degree.

A survey by the public service union Unison last year showed nine out of 10
student nurses would not have applied for a nursing degree without having
bursaries available.

Public Comment Request Pages 41315 - 41316 [FR DOC # 2016-14952]

LENGTH: 1135  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:



  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Resources and Services
Administration Agency Information Collection Activities: Proposed Collection:
Public Comment Request AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration,
HHS. ACTION: Notice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY:
In compliance with the requirement for opportunity for public comment on
proposed data collection projects (Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1995), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
announces plans to submit an Information Collection Request (ICR), described
below, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Prior to submitting the ICR
to OMB, HRSA seeks comments from the public regarding the burden estimate,
below, or any other aspect of the ICR. DATES: Comments on this ICR must be
received no later than August 23, 2016. ADDRESSES: Submit your comments to
paperwork@hrsa.gov or mail the HRSA Information Collection Clearance Officer,
Room 14N-39, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
CONTACT: To request more information on the proposed project or to obtain a copy
of the data collection plans and draft instruments, email

paperwork@hrsa.gov or call the HRSA Information Collection Clearance Officer at
(301) 443-1984. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: When submitting comments or
requesting information, please include the information request collection title
for reference. Information Collection Request Title: Small Rural Hospital
Transition Project (SRHT) OMB No. 0906-xxxx--New. Abstract: Under Section 330A
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254c(e)), the Federal Office of
Rural [[Page 41316]] Health Policy (FORHP) funds grant programs supporting
expanding access to, coordinating, restraining the cost of, and improving the
quality of essential health care services in rural and frontier communities.
Small rural hospitals are facing many challenges in the new health care
environment, including the concurrent need to better measure and account for
quality of care in all settings; improve transitions of care as patients move
from one care setting to another; the evolution of new payment approaches such
as value-based purchasing; and, new approaches to care delivery such as
accountable care organizations (ACO) and patient-centered medical homes. Success
in this new environment will require bridging the gaps between the current
system and the newly emerging system of healthcare delivery and payment. Because
little is known about how these new models might impact rural communities, there
is a need to help hospitals understand and consider those factors that would
make them logical participants in health care systems that focus on value. The
SRHT, also funded by Section 330A, will assist small rural hospitals facing
these challenges. The purpose of the project is to provide on-site technical
assistance to nine small rural hospitals residing in persistent poverty
counties. Technical assistance will be provided in the areas of: (1) Financial
assessments, (2) creating a quality-focused environment, (3) aligning services
to community need, and, (4) to the extent that financial and quality core areas
have been stabilized, provide assistance to help recipients of technical
assistance consider factors that would make them logical participants in health
care systems that focus on value (for example ACOs, shared savings programs,
primary care medical homes). Need and Proposed Use of the Information: SRHT
includes a deliverable to design processes for developing, receiving, reviewing,
and scoring hospital applications for participation in the SRHT project. The
processes will ensure that the selection of applicants is consistent with
established criteria and hospitals' readiness or ability to implement
consultants' recommendations. Specifically, the application form will be
designed to solicit information that will be scored and ranked to aid in the
selection of nine small rural hospitals to receive on-site technical assistance.
Likely Respondents: Small rural hospitals located in a rural community, as
defined by FORHP, persistent poverty county or a rural census tract of a metro
persistent poverty county and have 49 staffed beds or less as reported on the
hospital's most recently filed Medicare Cost Report. Hospitals may be for-profit
or not-for-profit. Burden Statement: Burden in this context means the time
expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, disclose or provide the
information requested. This includes the time needed to review instructions; to
develop, acquire, install and utilize technology and systems for the purpose of
collecting, validating and verifying information, processing and maintaining
information, and disclosing and providing information; to train personnel and to
be able to respond to a collection of information; to search data sources; to
complete and review the collection of information; and to transmit or otherwise
disclose the information. The total annual burden hours estimated for this ICR
are summarized in the table below. Total Estimated Annualized burden hours:

ROLLING TO VICTORY;
WHEELCHAIR TEAM SHOWS AIKEN STUDENTS HOW GAME IS PLAYED

BYLINE: By Krista Zilizi South Carolina Bureau

SECTION: SC NEIGHBORS; Pg. O01

LENGTH: 252 words


Tony Waters was quick on the basketball court, even though he couldn't move his
legs.

The 36-year-old was one of more than 40 players who strapped themselves into
wheelchairs Thursday for an exhibition basketball game at Aiken Technical
College.

The game marked the final day of Disability Awareness Month.

The game, dubbed Rolling In Their Shoes For A Day, was designed to show Aiken
Tech students the hardships people in wheelchairs face.

"It's hard to shoot because you can't jump," said 18-year-old Jessica Bailey, a
softball player at Aiken Tech. "The chair doesn't move with your body. It made
me respect my legs more."

For Mr. Waters, the chair is his life. He was born paralyzed from the waist
down.

At 15, he wanted to play basketball and said he's been shooting hoops ever
since.

Today, Mr. Waters and six other disabled athletes play for the Walton Blazing
Bulldogs, a competitive wheelchair team sponsored by Augusta's Walton
Rehabilitation Center. The team placed second in Division 2 of the Carolina
National Wheelchair Basketball Tournament last year.

"You constantly have to be doing laps on a track, and you have to do
weight-lifting to keep up your strength (to play basketball)," Mr. Waters said.

Aiken Tech Athletic Director Bruce Caper said his able-bodied team didn't stand
a chance against the Blazing Bulldogs. The Blazing Bulldogs won the game.

"We'll leave here still trying to maneuver the wheelchairs," he said.

Widespread 'wasta' used for overseas healthcare - Need to curb favoritism: Audit
Bureau

LENGTH: 388 words


KUWAIT CITY, Jan 22: Recent statistics of State Audit Bureau (SAB) indicate that
6456 citizens received overseas treatment from Jan 2014 and Jan 2015 via 'wasta'
and interference of some MPs and other personalities. It called for relevant
steps to avoid the repetition of such incidents, while limiting the phenomenon
of favoritism, reports Al-Seyassah daily.

In response to the observations of SAB, Ministry of Health said overseas
treatment is a completely technical issue determined after health check by the
relevant committee. However, SAB indicated many cases referred to the technical
committee were rejected more than once before their approval, which confirms the
interference of some influential people in changing previous decisions of the
committee.

It pointed out that many cases were referred directly to the committee with
signatures of the Minister of Health and the Undersecretary of Health. This
reveals the extent of inequity in the issue of sending patients for treatment
abroad that led to suspicions of embezzlement and forgeries in documents.

Meanwhile, the ministry stressed that patients are given more than one chance
with the technical committee, indicating patients have the right to go for
another checkup even if the initial request is rejected, because the supreme
committee may have a different opinion.

Report indicated reservations on the part of some health offices that rejected
advance payments since the process prevents supervision and audit of hospital
receipts and impedes financial monitoring. It stressed the importance of
limiting dealings with the hospitals that accept financial guarantee and avoid
hospitals that require advance payment.

In response, Ministry of Health said the technical committee has considered the
recommendations of the medical offices taking into account the quality of
medical services offered to patients to facilitate their recover.

It suggested the development of an integrated automatic system connecting
different directorates of the Health Ministry with the adoption of TPP system
that connects concerned directorates with the Overseas Treatment Directorate and
other health offices abroad, indicating the ministry is waiting for response of
the Ministry of Finance and approval of necessary budget for that purpose.

Bosses who go under the bonnet;
Technical knowledge can improve the credibility of a chief but good management
skills are much more important, writes Hannah Prevett

BYLINE: Hannah Prevett

SECTION: APPOINTMENTS;FEATURES; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 1001 words


If you want to lead a company, do you need to be an expert in what it does? For
nearly a decade Amanda Goodall has focused on the premise that "successful
leaders are those who have a deep understanding of the core business of their
organisation". The senior lecturer at Cass Business School argues that technical
experts will more easily establish credibility with employees, and they will
have a better understanding of the culture of the organisation and its sector.

One sector she has looked at is hospitals. Goodall found that while the number
of them headed by doctors has declined, those that are led by doctors are often
more financially successful.

The Cleveland Clinic in Ohio has been managed by physicians since its inception
in 1921. There is a clear correlation between the institution's leadership
principles and its continued success, said James Stoller, chairman of the
Education Institute at the clinic. "[Doctors] have an ... intrinsic appreciation
of the front-line experience of clinicians and therefore are more sensitive to,
and mindful of, the realities of those, as opposed to being channelled into a
bottom-line, ROI [return on investment] orientation alone," he said.

That's not to say all doctors are ready for management, said Mark Alexander,
consultant radiologist and director of medical education at Luton & Dunstable
Hospital. "Although they may have led their departments ... and they may be very
good in technical realms, clinicians often aren't skilled as managers - and
that's a skill they need to be effective leaders."

This may explain the scarcity of hospital bosses from a clinical background,
added Alexander. "There's a very small number of expert clinicians who have gone
on to be chief executives. Some of them perform very well and they are often
sought out for failing hospitals. But they are a tiny number." The Cleveland
Clinic Academy was established in 2002 to address this skills gap. As well as
providing leadership training for the Cleveland Clinic's own nurses, doctors and
administrators, it now caters for clinicians turned managers from 18 nations.

There are other sectors to which Goodall's theory can seemingly be applied.
Francis Griffiths is the European head of National Instruments, a Texas
technology company with customers in the science and engineering sectors. He
studied electrical and electronic engineering at university, and this has stood
him in good stead.

"It helps to have management and leadership that really understand our vision
and our technology because that's a big differentiator for National Instruments.
We combine hardware and software, so having senior people in the organisation
who understand that is very, very important."

His technical training also makes an impression on staff and customers, he
added. "When you are trying to inspire and lead an engineering-based
organisation, being able to demonstrate that you understand the technology - and
that you understand and can connect with the customers, who are also engineers
and scientists - gives you a tremendous amount of credibility."

However, for Simon Hayward, chief executive at Cirrus, a leadership consultancy,
being able to demonstrate technical ability is just one part of the jigsaw. "A
certain amount of expertise is important to understand the dynamics of an
organisation. Whether it's a hospital, a large digital company or a fashion
brand, knowing the nuances of the operating model is important if you are
leading the organisation and technical experience can help with that. But we
would put much more emphasis on leadership attributes."

There are several examples of leaders who have moved seamlessly between sectors,
bringing to each a fresh pair of eyes, said Hayward. Angela Ahrendts, the former
Burberry chief, will soon join Apple to head its retail division. "She [will
bring] a different perspective from that of people who have been with Apple for
a long time. That can be hugely beneficial. You see the organisation from a
different perspective. It's easier to see it objectively and to understand its
strengths and weaknesses," Hayward said.

Yvonne Sell, director at Hay Group, a management consultancy, predicted that it
will become harder for individuals to be expert leaders as organisations grow
ever more diverse and projects call for collaboration between many departments
and businesses.

"An example of this is the marrying up of cognitive scientists and IT
technicians to create iPhones," she said. "One person can't be an expert in all
of those things, and as organisations get more global, it's going to mean that
it will be close to impossible at any of those big businesses for the chief
executive to be an expert in everything."

The credentials of the board as a whole may need to come under scrutiny, as
opposed to solely those of the chief executive, said Hayward. "Does a chief
executive or a leader need to come from a technical background to be a good
leader of an organisation? No, clearly not, because the majority of leaders
don't come from a technical background.

"But they do need to surround themselves with people who understand the nuts and
bolts of each part of the business."

Sure grip on his tyres

John McNaught, UK managing director of the tyre company Bridgestone, has spent
35 years in the industry. Having earned his stripes in all areas of the
business, he is trusted by colleagues and customers alike.

"I spent 18 years in distribution and I have now worked 17 years for a
manufacturer. Having experience on both sides means that when I visit customers
at their premises, I know what's happening within that business," said McNaught.
"When I first joined Bridgestone 12 years ago, there were a lot of people
involved in the business who had no distribution experience. This meant that
they had a manufacturing viewpoint but they didn't really understand the
industry they were trying to sell into.

"I was able to come in and complement their knowledge, and over a period of time
we became a far better organisation."

Patients reel under heat as power cut hits SMS Hospital

BYLINE: TIMES NEWS NETWORK

SECTION: TIMES CITY

LENGTH: 348 words


Amid intense heat, the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital witnessed power failure on
Sunday afternoon. Patients were literally left under the weather with many
stepping outside the hospital premises to find relief.

As per officials, due to some technical fault, electricity supply remained
affected for over one-and-a-half hour.\x93There was no fault in SMS hospital's
electricity supply but some technical fault in the feeder of discom led to the
power cut,\x93 hospital's additional superintendent Dr Ajit Singh said.

Around 2pm, the power supply was disrupted. Attendants and some patients
admitted to the wards came out in the open. But those who could not come out
remain inside the wards, sources said.

After the power cut, the hospital administration immediately supplied
electricity to emergency , ICUs and also in operation theatre. However, other
units in the hospital, which are not connected to generators, faced
difficulties.

\x93At a time when the tempe

rature is hovering over 40 degrees, it is difficult to stay in ward. My patient
is admitted to trauma ward, as he has undergone surgery . The fans and coolers
are not working. There is intense heat inside,\x93 Babulal, attendant of a
patient said, who came to meet him on Sunday .

Not only the main building, but other parts of the hospital including cottage

wards and Bangar block where patients with heart and neuro diseases are
admitted, were affected by power cut. The hospital administration claimed that
the discom officials resolved the problem to ensure proper electricity supply in
the hospital.

In 2012, a major power failure had affected SMS Hospital's emergency services.
Patients on ventilators in ICU on the ground floor were shifted

to ICUs on the first floor. Some parts of the hospital had witnessed total
blackout.

After that incident, the hospital administration had repaired all the
electricity cables and made arrangement for backup power supply . However, on
Sunday , power failure was due to technical fault in feeder of discom, which has
nothing to do with hospital's arrangement of uninterrupted power supply .

LOTS OF BOUNCE FOR BABIES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 154 words


STUDENTS who bounced to raise money for Walsgrave Hospital's special baby care
unit have promised that their cheque won't do the same.

Twelve second-year nursery nurse students along with members of staff from
Coventry Technical College in the Butts, Earlsdon, spent seven hours jumping up
and down on a bouncy castle yesterday.

The teenagers were asked to organise a fund-raising event as part of their
coursework, and devised the bounce-a-thon because they felt a sponsored walk
would be "too boring."

Student Sue Cowley said: "We hope to raise as much money as possible.

"We all took turns on the castle throughout the day but we promise the cheque
won't bounce as well!"

Course tutor Sharon Broer said: "Everyone was messing around and having a lovely
time, although the ground did feel very strange afterwards."

The students hope to present a cheque to hospital staff in the next two weeks.

HSE server failure delays lab results

BYLINE: Louise Roseingrave

SECTION: IRELAND; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 418 words


A breakdown in the HSE South's IT server system is resulting in delayed access
to patient pathology results in five Munster hospitals.The five hospitals,
including Cork University Hospital (CUH), have reverted to accessing handwritten
laboratory results due to problems transmitting information across computers and
electronic devices such as smartphones.

Technical difficulties with the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
are causing delayed access to patient records affecting CUH, Mercy University
Hospital, Bantry General, Mallow General and Kerry General in Tralee.

The laboratory service in HSE South uses LIMS as a regional system to provide
prompt access to patient pathology results.

Ward theatres and GPs are experiencing significant delays, as laboratory staff
have resorted to hand-writing results and are relying on "less than satisfactory
means" to deliver results, according to a hospital source.

It is understood a server system failed last Saturday, and continued efforts to
fix the problem have failed.  Blood transfusions The situation is of particular
concern for medics treating patients requiring blood transfusions as "there is
no or very limited access to patient's historical blood requirements," according
to an informed source.

Responding to a request for comment, HSE South confirmed problems with the LIMS
system and said efforts to rectify the issue were ongoing.

"Some technical difficulties have occurred in the Laboratory Information
Management System at CUH and the hospital's Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) Department is working with the suppliers of the system to
correct these technical issues as quickly as possible," it said in a statement.

The laboratory service has implemented "contingency arrangements" to continue to
provide "essential diagnostic services to the hospital departments, GPs and
other community services".

The HSE said its laboratory service was working extended hours as the problem
continued.

"All urgent samples are being prioritised but some delays are being experienced
for the results of samples classed as routine or non-urgent due to the system
reverting to a manual process until the IT issue is resolved," the HSE said.

"CUH management wish to extend their thanks to staff in CUH for their efforts
and all parties are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible."

Pathology services carry out investigations on specimens from patients and are
therefore central to the diagnosis, management and treatment of disease.

NURSING undergraduates at the University of Canberra may think themselves lucky
when they visit the History of Nursing Museum which has just opened in the
School of Nursing.

For one thing, they may well be relieved that pay rates have increased from 10 a
year since the early 1900s.

They may also appreciate that uniforms no longer have to be starched and that
much of the hospital equipment has been revolutionised many times over.

According to UC Senior Lecturer in Nursing Carmel O'Meara, the museum (planning
for which began over 18 months ago), will give students a historical overview of
their profession.  "They will know how far we have come and I'm sure the
perspective will enhance their education," Mrs O'Meara said.

With artifacts ranging from 1950s and 1960s Royal Canberra Hospital uniforms, an
old metal hospital bed and rather gruesome mortuary table, cane baby scales, and
a myriad of technical but old-fashioned looking instruments, the museum succeeds
in taking observers back through the decades.  Old nursing guides and manuals
which suggest nursing is a suitable career for a married woman to have  and
medical books are also on display.

Much of the material collected for the exhibition  which is a permanent display
  comes from the Warren-Newman collection from the Royal Canberra hospital and
from regional hospitals.

Janet Newman and Jenni Warren wrote Royal Canberra Hospital: An Anecdotal
History of Nursing  1914 to 1991.

According to Mrs O'Meara, "Nursing is still very much a vocation where you need
to be a people person who enjoys caring for other." Yet the fact that registered
nurses now need a university degree is a major difference.

"Nurses are now very highly trained and much of the course is science-based, "
she said.

Yet according to Mrs O'Meara the biggest change to the profession has been the
entry of males, who now make up 15 per cent of the UC undergraduate intake.

"Fifty year ago that would have been completely unheard of," she said. - EMMA

High school students get prepared for working world;
Interns paired with pros at restaurants, hospitals, banks

BYLINE: ERIN KOURKOUNIS; Tribune staff

LENGTH: 559 words



HIGHLIGHT: Each summer, a couple hundred Hillsborough County high-school
students enrolled in career and technical programs land internships with local
businesses. In addition to internships in the finance, maritime, agriculture and
health services industries, new this summer are culinary internships. Many of
the companies, like Sun Coast Credit Union, end up hiring some interns full time
once they turn 18.


TAMPA - More than 150 students who attend Hillsborough County high schools are
getting a taste of what it's like to be in the working world this summer.

Depending on their field, the teens are working in internships alongside
professionals at local establishments such as restaurants, hospitals and banks.
Internships are required of students enrolled in career and technical programs
at their schools.

Career and technical education is all about preparing the student to go into the
workforce, said Chris Jargo, the school district's assistant director for career
and technical education. The school-based experience is important to give them
basic skills, but the work-based experience is just as important.

The summer programs help students get a feel for whether they would enjoy a
career in the field in which they are interning.

So maritime interns work at the Port of Tampa, and finance interns work in banks
and credit unions. Those studying agribusiness work in seed stores or as
farmhands. Health science students are doing clinical internships in hospitals.

New this year is a short-term internship program for about 25 culinary students.
Those students spend up to two weeks rotating through jobs in local eateries
such as the Columbia Restaurant and Mise en Place.

If they do a great job, sometimes they get hired, Jargo said.

Suncoast Credit Union hired 11 interns out of 30 candidates from Jefferson,
Brandon and Armwood high schools this summer. For six weeks, the students work
40 hours per week at the administrative office on Hillsborough Avenue,
collecting a paycheck and attending weekly training sessions.

The credit union's internship program is more than 10 years old. The students,
who are paid $9 per hour, are halfway through their internships.

Johnathan Navarro, who will be a senior at Jefferson High in the fall, is in the
learning and development department at Suncoast. He has taken classes through
Jefferson's finance academy since his freshman year.

The internship isn't his first job, but it is the first one that has made him
feel like a professional adult with a career, he said.

He starts off the workday at 8:30 a.m. with a cup of coffee before checking
emails at his desk. He spends the rest of the day working on projects he's been
assigned.

His latest assignment is photographing historical documents for a collage that
will be displayed in the credit union's boardroom.

I've always wanted to get into the financial world, he said. I didn't think I'd
be so involved coming into an internship. I'd expect to do grunt work. I feel
I've been placed perfectly.

After high school, Johnathan plans to study film production and business in
college.

Working for a company that's this big, established and successful will only help
me in the long run, he said.

Shameka Archer, 33, was an intern in the credit union's accounting department as
a senior in Jefferson's finance academy in 1998. In May, she began working there
again, but this time as a recruiter in human resources.

From her intern days, Archer remembers getting a foundation in professionalism
and working as part of a team. Now, she encourages this year's interns to learn
from their experience there.

The opportunity gave me a good idea of how to learn what I wanted to do for my
future, she said.

Scrutiny of technology inadequate, study says   Hospitals accused of not
considering costs

BYLINE: CHRISTIE McLAREN; GAM

LENGTH: 358 words

DATELINE: Toronto ONT


BY CHRISTIE McLAREN
Health Policy Reporter
  TORONTO
 New technology, considered a major cause of soaring health-care costs
around the world, is welcomed into most Ontario hospitals with very little
scrutiny, a new study has found.

Hospital managers often fail to consider potentially expensive factors
such as long-term operating costs when they decide to buy complex new
medical equipment, Raisa Deber, author of the study and a professor of
health administration at the University of Toronto, said yesterday.

Although hospitals spend millions of dollars annually on new
technology, few of them have a formal system to evaluate whether the new
equipment works, whether it is needed, and how it will affect tight
hospital budgets, Ms Deber told the Canadian Conference on Health
Economics in Toronto.

That kind of scrutiny "is virtually non-existent," Ms Deber told the
gathering of about 200 economists and hospital and government officials.

Ms Deber surveyed 120 Ontario hospitals, 415 key hospital managers and
74 official hospital forms used by staff to request new pieces of
equipment.

Ontario hospitals are spending an average of about $2-million each in
capital costs per year, with the range from $4,000 to $45-million, she
said. Half of this money is spent on medical equipment and technology.

Yet most hospitals rely on what could be considered biased information
when deciding whether to purchase new equipment, according to the survey.

The vast majority - 82 per cent - get their information about new
technology from the doctors or other employees who are demanding it. More
than 70 per cent said they get information from the manufacturer, and just
over half say they look at written assessments of the technology prepared
by technical experts.

Hospital committees making these decisions usually consist of
administrators and physicians, and rarely include staff nurses, whose
working conditions are often the most affected by new equipment, or
technical experts, Ms Deber noted.

She called it "rather striking" that a third of them ask only the
purchase price and fail to ask whether extra employees and supplies will
be necessary to operate a new piece of equipment.

Dedicated team leads drive for cleanliness

The Architects Design Group (ADG) has set up a dedicated team to support its
growing client base in the healthcare sector.

Adg Healthcare, led by group director Phil Burgess, pulls together a range of
health-related expertise within the Plymouth-based architectural practice and is
recognition of its growing stature in the healthcare market.

ADG has already carved out a national reputation for its work in creating
disinfection and sterilisation units across the UK for the private healthcare
Nuffield Hospitals group and the NHS is now showing interest in this area of
expertise.

ADG has also recently been appointed as technical adviser to the Torbay NHS Care
Trust for a planned healthy living centre in Paignton in Devon that will bring
together a range of health and community care services under one roof.

And ADG's planning and regeneration team was appointed earlier this year by the
Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust to provide planning consultancy services for a
range of potential projects in and around Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.

Mr Burgess, a Fellow of the Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estate
Management, said: "ADG Healthcare brings together all these disciplines, from
planning consultancy and design to highly specialised technical advice. It's a
market where we are seeing significant growth so we wanted to structure our
business in a way that best suits the needs of our clients."

ADG has a strong track record in the healthcare sector ranging from GP and
dental surgeries to hospital extensions, operating theatres and sterilisation
units. Most recently the practice celebrated the completion of an extension to
the Nuffield Hospital in Plymouth, including new operating theatres.

Mr Burgess added: "Our role extends far beyond the design process. Increasingly
we are being asked to advise on a range of technical and compliance issues for
clients in the public and private sector because the rules governing healthcare
facilities are becoming increasingly stringent."

ADG Healthcare has extensive knowledge of the Department of Health's Health
Building Notes, which govern best practice in the planning and design of
healthcare facilities, and its Health Technical Memoranda which set specific
standards for healthcare building features like windows and sanitary ware, and
the design and operation of engineering services like medical gas installations
and fire safety systems.

A particular area of expertise is offsite disinfection and sterilisation units.
These are centralised facilities serving a number of local hospitals to clean
surgical instruments after operations and have stemmed from new EU regulations
introduced in 2006.

With infection control very high on the Government's agenda, and the first new
guidance in 10 years on this issue only published last year, the private sector
has taken the lead in developing new units that can handle millions of
instruments a year.

ADG Healthcare has designed six such centres for Nuffield Hospitals in Devon,
Hampshire, Warwickshire, Cambridgeshire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, three of
which are already up and running. The centres will serve 39 hospitals between
them once completed.

It has also carried out a study for a sterilisation centre for an NHS Trust in
the South West and has designed a centre for a group of independent hospitals in
central London.

ADG Healthcare's experience includes adult mental health, audiology, cardiology,
critical care, dental, endoscopy, hydrotherapy, diagnostic imaging, laser
treatment, ophthalmology, pathology, pharmacy and physiotherapy, together with
reception and waiting areas, records, administration, training and outpatient
treatment.

Dialysis center made functioning by orders of Punjab CM

LENGTH: 305  words


On the special directions of the Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif,
the dialysis center has been made functioning by the district administration of
Sialkot. The said dialysis center had been lying out of use for the last one
month at Government Allama Iqbal Memorial DHQ Hospital due to some undisclosed
technical faults in the machinery and prolonged non-availability of any
qualified urologist, technical assistants and paramedics there.

Sialkot DCO Zahid Saleem Gondal visited the dialysis center and told the newsmen
that the said dialysis center has been brought in working order. As the new
blood filtration plants and new related machinery has been replaced there with
the help of the local philanthropists. He said that now a qualified urologist
and technical staff have also been deputed there.

DCO said that the Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif has taken very
serious notice of the news item published in national dailies regarding the lock
up of said dialysis center. The CM ordered immediate functioning of this
dialysis center in the larger interest of the local kidney patients, in this
regard.

It was the only facility at the above-mentioned DHQ hospital for the kidney
patients from Sialkot district's all the four Sialkot, Daska, Sambrial and
Pasrur tehsils.

Instead of making some practical efforts, the administration of Govt. Allama
Iqbal Memorial DHQ Hospital Sialkot had finally locked up this dialysis center,
putting the poor kidney patients at the mercy of the private hospitals and
clinics.

Three years ago, the Punjab government had established this dialysis center for
providing the better and advanced treatment to the deserving and poor kidney
patients. Since then, no qualified urologist and technical assistants had yet
been appointed there by the provincial health department there

centre will be constructed at a cost of Rs190 million including cost of
machinery, other allied equipment and staff. State-of-the-art cardiac centre
will be equipped with all latest facilities. It was informed that CDA spends
Rs25 million on cardiac patients who are referred to other hospitals due to
non-availability of these facilities at CDA Hospital. After the establishment of
this modern cardiac centre, CDA would not only save Rs25 million, but also earn
a handsome amount by treating the private patients. The meeting also decided
that operation theatre at the CDA Hospital would be upgraded, expanded and
modernised according to present time needs.

In this regard it was decided that the operation theatre at CDA Hospital would
be upgraded and expanded to enable it to conduct four operations simultaneously.

The technical committee in Tuesday's meeting also approved in principle to
provide all facilities to the allottees of Park Enclave Housing Project as
committed in the brochures at the time of launch of the housing scheme. The
Rs3.68 PC-1 for development of the Park Enclave would also be approved soon.

It may be pointed here that former chairman Nadeem Hasan Asif had ordered to
exclude many attractive features of the project with directives to reduce the
PC-1 from Rs3.68 billion to Rs1.7 billion.

Meanwhile, on the directions of CDA Chairman Maroof Afzal, CDA has launched a
special campaign against the non-confirming use of residential areas in
different sectors of Islamabad.

Responding to the complaints of Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry
different trade associations, the CDA chairman has constituted a team to launch
this operation. The team consists of Director Municipal Administration (DMA),
Assistant Commissioner (City) ICT, Deputy Director Building Control Section
(BCS) and Deputy Director Trade License DMA.

The spokesman further said that this team has started working from Tuesday and
visited F-6 and F-7 sectors to serve notices to all violators.

The CDA chairman has directed the team to take action across the board without
any fear or favour. This operation will be extended to the whole city

IT glitch at hospitals causes major test result delays

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 303 words


The problem arose last weekend, and some patients attending Cork University
Hospital who are awaiting test results described the situation as "chaotic".

One man, who did not wish to be identified, said a relative with cancer had
treatment held up as they waited for blood test results. Another patient said
diabetics attending an outpatient clinic were told to go home and return another
day.

The HSE confirmed that problems arose last Saturday in the Laboratory
Information Management System at CUH and that its ICT department was "working
with the suppliers of the system to correct these technical issues as quickly as
possible".

It is a centralised IT system which supports services at CUH, Kerry General,
Mallow General, and Bantry General, as well as the Mercy Hospital's blood
transfusion lab.

GPs have already been notified by the HSE and asked not to send samples for
testing to the hospitals. Urgent cases are being "prioritised", the HSE said.
However, it added that "some delays are being experienced for the results of
samples classed as routine or non-urgent due to the system reverting to a manual
process until the IT issue is resolved".

The HSE said the lab service had implemented contingency arrangements "in order
to continue to provide the required essential diagnostic services to the
hospital departments, GPs and other community services", all of whom have been
informed of the technical issues. The lab service is working extended hours at
this time.

A HSE spokeswoman said the technical issues did not mean pathology tests were
not being carried out, but that results had to be written up manually. She said
they were "working around the clock" to resolve the problem.

She said a number of the lab IT systems are being restored on a phased basis and
it is hoped to be fully restored in the coming days.

Commentary: Another reason to check your medical bills

BYLINE: David Donovan

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 223  words


Apparently the phrase "Okay, fine, you caught me" is not in hospitals'
vocabulary.

Last December, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina implemented a new policy
concerning how it would reimburse the "technical component" of certain
outpatient radiology procedures. The "technical component" refers to things like
checking in a patient, providing a gown and doing prep work -- things that are
typically done only one time no matter how many scans are performed. Hospitals
were routinely billing BCBSNC for technical components on every scan. In other
words, they were billing multiple times for services only performed once. The
new BCBSNC policy sought to end that practice.

In response, the North Carolina Hospital Association sent a complaint letter
(Really? Not an apology letter?) to the North Carolina Department of Insurance
asking it to block the new policy. In a ruling issued Nov. 14, common sense
prevailed. Although DOI rulings make Business Court decisions read like a John
Grisham novel, the thrust of the decision was that BCBSNC could implement the
policy right away.

We have to ask ourselves, what important legal right did the hospital
association think it was standing up for? The right to bilk customers? The right
to get paid multiple times for a task only performed once?

ASYLUM PROBE AT HOSPITAL;
 EXCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPERTS READY TO ASSESS SITE

BYLINE: Peter Collins

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1,2

LENGTH: 301 words


HOPES that Sully Hospital would be removed from the list of sites that could
become centres for asylum seekers have suffered a setback.

Planning consultants for the Home Office have confirmed that they will be
carrying out further "technical evaluations" of the former psychiatric hospital
in Sully.

But John Smith, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, says he remains confident that the
Sully site will be rejected once the technical studies are completed.

A spokesman for the MP said Mr Smith had explained to Lord Rooker, Minister for
Citizenship and Immigration, that there were severe technical difficulties
involved in the use of Sully Hospital as a centre for refugees. These are now
being investigated by the Home Office.

At a full meeting of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, leader Coun Jeff James said
leading councillors and officers were seeking an urgent meeting with the Home
Office.

He said Rob Quick, the Vale council's director of environmental and economic
regeneration, had already written to the Home Office outlining "the widespread
opposition to the proposal".

A council spokesman said: "The council has already voiced major concerns about
the proposal.

"The authority feels that the site is not suitable or safe for the asylum
seekers, particular as the former hospital was closed, at least in part, because
of health and safety concerns at the site."

Sully Hospital is on a shortlist of eight sites in the country, which are under
consideration by the Home Office. Four will be chosen as centres for asylum
seekers.

Brian Harwicke, a member of the Sully Residents Action Group, set up to oppose
the proposal, told the Echo: "We will press ahead with our campaign.

We want to see the hospital used as a children's hospital or a convalescence
centre."

Boys basketball

* Hawks' Koger out of hospital Riverton sophomore guard Matt Koger, who was
hospitalized last week because of a mysterious infection in his left hand and
forearm, was discharged Saturday from St. John's Hospital.

Matt's father, former Riverton head coach Jeff Koger, said Sunday that the
problem finally was diagnosed as a staph infection caused by a small cut on
Matt's left thumb. Matt was admitted to St. John's on Tuesday, and he was kept
on intravenous antibiotics until the swelling in the hand and arm subsided.

There is, however, still a small lump on the arm, and Matt is taking an oral
antibiotic for that. If the lump isn't reduced sufficiently by Wednesday, it
probably will be removed surgically.

Matt is scheduled to be back in school today, when he can resume basketball
conditioning. If the lump is reduced enough by Wednesday, he can rejoin the team
and prepare for Friday's game against Nokomis and Saturday's home showdown
against Quincy Notre Dame.

Matt missed the 13-3 Hawks' wins over Illini Central and Athens last week, and
he'll miss Tuesday's game at Petersburg Porta. But he said he wasn't surprised
by the team's performance. That includes the effort of fellow sophomore Richie
Combs, who has started during Matt's absence.

"I hate missing the games, but I knew the guys would step up, especially
Richie," Matt said. "It got pretty boring in the hospital, being in bed all day.
I watched a lot of ESPN."

Matt said the team visited him at St. John's on Wednesday night. He also got a
phone call from another Sangamo Conference player who, unfortunately, will be
out of action the rest of the season with a knee injury: Buffalo Tri-City senior
Walter Patton.

"Walt Patton called me at the hospital, just wondering what was wrong," Koger
said. "That was pretty nice of him. I feel bad for him, especially since he's a
senior."

* Technical difficulties for Mount Olive

It was merely the consolation championship game of the Macoupin County
Tournament. But Virden's 71-70 win over Mount Olive Saturday at the Virden gym
was a thriller that wasn't decided until the Bulldogs' Tyler Lewis hit an
18-footer with about 6 seconds left.

Doug Zehr just wishes he could've been there to see it.

Zehr, the Mount Olive head coach, spent the last 7 minutes of the game in the
locker room after a series of technical fouls caused him and his volunteer
assistant coach, Mike Favre, to be ejected from the game. Zehr had received a
technical earlier in the game, and then Favre got two "T's" about a minute into
the fourth quarter.

Favre's double-technical meant he was ejected from the building. As the head
coach, Zehr had to leave the gymnasium because a total of three technicals had
been given to the Mount Olive bench. That left two other assistants, Al Downing
and Tim Rhymer, to coordinate things the rest of the way.

It reminded many of the scene in "Hoosiers" when the head coach, Gene Hackman,
is ejected, leaving Dennis Hopper to run the show for Hickory. But Zehr, who
cited several differences he had with Saturday's officiating, said the real-life
situation was unfair to Downing and Rhymer.

"It's not a situation you'd want to be in," Zehr said. "Al was uncomfortable,
and I can understand that. We talked afterward, and there might have been a few
things I would've done different. But the kids also coached themselves quite a
bit.

"I think the kids really came together under some tough circumstances. We had a
discussion in the locker room afterward, and we told them it was just a lesson
in life."

Favre, formerly the head coach for the Wildcats, will have to sit out Tuesday
night's game against Mulberry Grove because he received two direct technicals.
But Zehr will have his whole staff back Friday when the Wildcats play host to -
you guessed it - Virden.

* Warrensburg, Miners on collision course

The marquee matchup for the Riverton Subway Shootout Feb. 15 is the 7:30 p.m.
game between Warrensburg-Latham and Gillespie.  The odds are increasing that it
will be a battle of unbeatens.

The Cardinals (16-0) probably have a tougher schedule than the Miners (18-0)
between now and Feb. 15. Assuming Warrensburg plays three games in the Okaw
Valley Conference Tournament Jan. 31-Feb. 7, the Cardinals have seven more
contests before coming to Riverton.

Warrensburg has a potential title-game matchup against Monticello (16-2) in the
OVC Tournament, and the Cardinals also face Maroa-Forsyth (12-5) Feb. 11.

Gillespie, meanwhile, has four games prior to the Riverton Shootout: Tuesday
against Roxana (6-11); Friday at home against Piasa Southwestern (14-5), which
lost to the Miners 76-60 in the Macoupin County title game Saturday; Feb. 4 at
Carlinville (6-11); and Feb. 7 at home East Alton-Wood River (6-16).

The Gillespie-Warrensburg game also could be a preview of the Shelbyville
Sectional semifinals. Gillespie is assigned to the Raymond Lincolnwood Regional,
while Warrensburg plays in the Mount Pulaski Regional. Winners of those two
regionals will meet at Shelbyville.

* COMING THIS WEEK: The January tourney schedule is winding down, but the 75th
annual A-C Central Invitational will be in full swing in Ashland. Top-seeded
Auburn meets improving Pittsfield at 6:30 p.m. today, followed by No. 2 Calvary
Academy against Franklin, an upset winner over Winchester on Saturday. An Auburn
win tonight would send the Trojans to a semifinal against Athens at 6:30 p.m.
Thursday. Auburn beat Athens 61-49 for the Waverly Holiday Tournament
championship. A Calvary win tonight would mean a semifinal date against White
Hall North Greene at 8 p.m. Thursday. The championship game is set for 4 p.m.
Saturday. ... Class A coaches meet one week from today to seed the regional
tournaments.

Girls basketball

* Bluffs gets rare win over Rushville

Brian Bettis has coached some very good girls basketball teams at Bluffs over
the last eight years. But the Lady Bluejays never could solve one of the
traditional Class A toughies of west central Illinois: Rushville.

That finally changed a week ago, when Bluffs - which co-ops with Meredosia -
traveled to Rushville and came away with a 56-41 victory. Rushville was No. 4 in
The State Journal-Register Class A area ratings, while Bluffs was not ranked in
the top 10.

Bettis said the victory was especially pleasing because his team was without one
of its key players, freshman forward Rene Evans, who was ill.

"We played exceptionally well, even though we didn't have Rene," Bettis said.
"We've probably had some other years where we should've beaten (Rushville), but
we really were hitting on all cylinders this time.

"I think we might have beaten them back in 1989 or '90, before I was coach."

Calling out for radio volunteers;
The Royal Oldham Hospital station Radio Cavell is looking for new recruits

BYLINE: By Ruhubia Akbor

LENGTH: 231 words


A hospital radio station is searching for new volunteers to help out on the
airwaves.

Radio Cavell at The Royal Oldham Hospital has a number of positions up for grabs
from presenters to technical support.

Director Graham Nelmes said: "We're always looking for fresh blood.

"The main role on offer is being a presenter.

"You can either be part of a team or for those who are a little more keener you
can run your own show.

"We're also looking for people who may be able to help us on the technical side,
those who may have worked in telecommunications or with satellite dishes and
those who know their way around a computer."

Administrative and support roles are also available and full training will be
given.

Graham added: "There really is a job for everyone. It's an invaluable service
for patients and they love getting their requests played.

"It's not a lot of fun to be in hospital but we provide something that will lift
the boredom a little."

Radio Cavell was launched in 1972 but the hospital has had a radio service since
the 1930s when a matron used to use the tannoy system to entertain patients at
the Boundary Park Hospital every Friday afternoon.

The station is licenced to broadcast on the hospital grounds but hopes to also
stream online to target even more people.

Anyone who would like to volunteer their services is asked to email
volunteer@radiocavell.co.uk or call 0161 628 4106.

NEW QUESTIONS POSED ABOUT TAPES IN INQUIRY ON MONTEFIORE ASSAULT

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

SECTION: Section B; Page 3, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 597 words


New questions emerged yesterday about two tape recordings that have become the
focal point of an investigation into an attempted murder of a Bronx hospital
administrator.

A Bronx assistant district attorney said in court that Acting Justice Archie A.
Gorfinkel of State Supreme Court, who unsealed the tapes, had reported having
technical difficulties in listening to one of them.

The assistant district attorney, Steven R. Kartagener, said the technical
problems experienced by the judge had raised questions about ''the integrity of
the tapes'' and whether they had been altered before being turned over to the
judge. Mr. Kartagener said that the judge had called the District Attorney's
office and reported '' 'something is not working properly with the tapes.' ''

Mr. Kartagener said the technical problems that the judge said he had
experienced ''raises the question of the integrity of the tapes.''

Tapes Made on Jan. 3

Later, outside the court, Mr. Kartagener said: ''There is a possibility some
interested party could have altered these tapes. At the very least the grand
jury has the right to know if the tapes are pure and pristine.''

The tapes were made on Jan. 3 by Dr. Richard G. Rosen, a surgeon at Montefiore
Hospital and Medical Center, who has been identified by the Bronx District
Attorney's office as the ''primary suspect'' in the near-fatal hammer beating of
his assistant, Clara Vanderbilt. She was found unconscious in Dr. Rosen's office
across the street from the hospital in the North Bronx on New Year's Eve.

Mrs. Vanderbilt, who is 41 years old, was reported in satisfactory condition
yesterday at the hospital. She has been unable to identify her assailant, but
she has said she did not believe the 51-year-old Dr. Rosen was responsible for
the attack.

Mr. Kartagener raised the tampering issue before the Appellate Division of the
State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He said that on Feb. 1, Justice Gorfinkel, the
first judge to examine the tapes, telephoned the District Attorney's office's
and said: ''I need some assistance, something is not working properly with the
tapes.''

Found Irrelevant to Inquiry

Justice Gorfinkel - without citing any technical problems in hearing the tapes -
ruled on Feb. 3 that the tapes were irrelevant to the investigation and that
District Attorney Mario Merola of the Bronx had no right to examine them.

Justice Gorfinkel, reached by telephone yesterday, declined to comment on the
statements by Mr. Kartagener.  Dr. Rosen's lawyer, Jonathan Rosner, told the
five-member court there was no evidence to support the suggestion that the tapes
had been altered.

Dr. Rosen, the vice chairman of the hospital's department of surgery, has
refused to turn over the tapes, citing constitutional and other legal grounds.

Mr. Merola has described the tapes as ''oral suicide notes'' made by Dr. Rosen
after he had learned that Mrs. Vanderbilt would recover. The District Attorney's
office has said that Dr. Rosen, who is married, a nd Mrs. Vanderbilt, who is
divorced, were romantically involved and that the tapes are ''essential'' to the
investigation.

The appellate court, which now has the tapes, gave no indication when it would
rule. Both sides said they would appeal an unfavorable decision to the state's
highest court, the Court of Appeals.

Agency selection for setting up super-specialty hospital

LENGTH: 293 words

DATELINE: Raipur


Raipur, Oct. 6 -- The Directorate of Medical Education (DME) will select a
Technical Agency for establishing super-specialty hospital at Dau Kalyan Singh
(DKS) Bhawan by the end of October 2014.

The Request for Proposal (RoP) for selection of the Technical Support Agency
(TSA) has been issued by DME and the process will be completed by the last week
of this month, sources said.

The proposed super specialty hospital will provide services in six disciplines
including Renal Sciences, Neurosciences, Endocrinology, Pediatric surgery,
Burn-plastic and Reconstructive surgery besides setting up of an Infertility
Treatment Centre. It will also have a 20 bed emergency ward.

The DME has decided to establish a super specialty hospital with a capacity of
250-300 beds at DKS Bhawan after the Secretariat was shifted to Mahanadi Bhawan
in Naya Raipur.

The Directorate of Medical Education has invited RoP for selection of agency
while the pre-bid meeting is scheduled on October 10. The bids will be opened
and the Technical Agency will be selected on October 21.

DME has mentioned that the work for establishing the super-specialty hospital
will start from December 1, 2014 and the work will be completed in one year. It
has been planned that the super specialty hospital will start providing services
from January 2016.

The TSA will have to set up a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the DKS Bhawan to
deliver the services. It will also have to depute a two-member team comprising a
doctor with experience in hospital administration and a professional in hospital
management.

Dedicated team leads drive for cleanliness;
The Architects Design Group (ADG) has set up a dedicated team to support its
growing client base in the healthcare sector.

BYLINE: David Wilcock

SECTION: Pg. 11

LENGTH: 589 words


Adg Healthcare, led by group director Phil Burgess, pulls together a range of
health-related expertise within the Plymouth-based architectural practice and is
recognition of its growing stature in the healthcare market.

ADG has already carved out a national reputation for its work in creating
disinfection and sterilisation units across the UK for the private healthcare
Nuffield Hospitals group and the NHS is now showing interest in this area of
expertise.

ADG has also recently been appointed as technical adviser to the Torbay NHS Care
Trust for a planned healthy living centre in Paignton in Devon that will bring
together a range of health and community care services under one roof.

And ADG's planning and regeneration team was appointed earlier this year by the
Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust to provide planning consultancy services for a
range of potential projects in and around Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.

Mr Burgess, a Fellow of the Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estate
Management, said: "ADG Healthcare brings together all these disciplines, from
planning consultancy and design to highly specialised technical advice. It's a
market where we are seeing significant growth so we wanted to structure our
business in a way that best suits the needs of our clients."

ADG has a strong track record in the healthcare sector ranging from GP and
dental surgeries to hospital extensions, operating theatres and sterilisation
units. Most recently the practice celebrated the completion of an extension to
the Nuffield Hospital in Plymouth, including new operating theatres.

Mr Burgess added: "Our role extends far beyond the design process. Increasingly
we are being asked to advise on a range of technical and compliance issues for
clients in the public and private sector because the rules governing healthcare
facilities are becoming increasingly stringent."

ADG Healthcare has extensive knowledge of the Department of Health's Health
Building Notes, which govern best practice in the planning and design of
healthcare facilities, and its Health Technical Memoranda which set specific
standards for healthcare building features like windows and sanitary ware, and
the design and operation of engineering services like medical gas installations
and fire safety systems.

A particular area of expertise is offsite disinfection and sterilisation units.
These are centralised facilities serving a number of local hospitals to clean
surgical instruments after operations and have stemmed from new EU regulations
introduced in 2006.

With infection control very high on the Government's agenda, and the first new
guidance in 10 years on this issue only published last year, the private sector
has taken the lead in developing new units that can handle millions of
instruments a year.

ADG Healthcare has designed six such centres for Nuffield Hospitals in Devon,
Hampshire, Warwickshire, Cambridgeshire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, three of
which are already up and running. The centres will serve 39 hospitals between
them once completed.

It has also carried out a study for a sterilisation centre for an NHS Trust in
the South West and has designed a centre for a group of independent hospitals in
central London.

ADG Healthcare's experience includes adult mental health, audiology, cardiology,
critical care, dental, endoscopy, hydrotherapy, diagnostic imaging, laser
treatment, ophthalmology, pathology, pharmacy and physiotherapy, together with
reception and waiting areas, records, administration, training and outpatient
treatment.

Dedicated team leads drive for cleanliness;
The Architects Design Group (ADG) has set up a dedicated team to support its
growing client base in the healthcare sector.

Adg Healthcare, led by group director Phil Burgess, pulls together a range of
health-related expertise within the Plymouth-based architectural practice and is
recognition of its growing stature in the healthcare market.

ADG has already carved out a national reputation for its work in creating
disinfection and sterilisation units across the UK for the private healthcare
Nuffield Hospitals group and the NHS is now showing interest in this area of
expertise.

ADG has also recently been appointed as technical adviser to the Torbay NHS Care
Trust for a planned healthy living centre in Paignton in Devon that will bring
together a range of health and community care services under one roof.

And ADG's planning and regeneration team was appointed earlier this year by the
Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust to provide planning consultancy services for a
range of potential projects in and around Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.

Mr Burgess, a Fellow of the Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estate
Management, said: "ADG Healthcare brings together all these disciplines, from
planning consultancy and design to highly specialised technical advice. It's a
market where we are seeing significant growth so we wanted to structure our
business in a way that best suits the needs of our clients."

ADG has a strong track record in the healthcare sector ranging from GP and
dental surgeries to hospital extensions, operating theatres and sterilisation
units. Most recently the practice celebrated the completion of an extension to
the Nuffield Hospital in Plymouth, including new operating theatres.

Mr Burgess added: "Our role extends far beyond the design process. Increasingly
we are being asked to advise on a range of technical and compliance issues for
clients in the public and private sector because the rules governing healthcare
facilities are becoming increasingly stringent."

ADG Healthcare has extensive knowledge of the Department of Health's Health
Building Notes, which govern best practice in the planning and design of
healthcare facilities, and its Health Technical Memoranda which set specific
standards for healthcare building features like windows and sanitary ware, and
the design and operation of engineering services like medical gas installations
and fire safety systems.

A particular area of expertise is offsite disinfection and sterilisation units.
These are centralised facilities serving a number of local hospitals to clean
surgical instruments after operations and have stemmed from new EU regulations
introduced in 2006.

With infection control very high on the Government's agenda, and the first new
guidance in 10 years on this issue only published last year, the private sector
has taken the lead in developing new units that can handle millions of
instruments a year.

ADG Healthcare has designed six such centres for Nuffield Hospitals in Devon,
Hampshire, Warwickshire, Cambridgeshire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, three of
which are already up and running. The centres will serve 39 hospitals between
them once completed.

It has also carried out a study for a sterilisation centre for an NHS Trust in
the South West and has designed a centre for a group of independent hospitals in
central London.

ADG Healthcare's experience includes adult mental health, audiology, cardiology,
critical care, dental, endoscopy, hydrotherapy, diagnostic imaging, laser
treatment, ophthalmology, pathology, pharmacy and physiotherapy, together with
reception and waiting areas, records, administration, training and outpatient
treatment.

Health technical wing set up

SECTION: Vol. 71 No. 03

LENGTH: 304  words


After facing criticism about the lack of expertise in the health sector, the
Ministry of Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) has finally
established the Health Technical Wing (HTW) to provide input on matters relating
to the health sector in the capital city.

Through the new unit, CADD will be able to interact with international
organisations and donor agencies on issues of health and population.

The head of the wing will be appointed from outside while experts already
available with CADD will be transferred to it.

After the 18th amendment, the health sector was devolved to provinces. However,
hospitals and other health institutions in the federal capital were placed under
CADD.

As CADD had no expertise to run the health department, proposals were flouted
that the healthcare institutions should be placed under the Ministry of National
Health Services.

An official statement issued on Monday said the new wing would work under the
chief/director general health, a grade-20 officer, who would be responsible for
scrutinising the proposals and recommendations presented to CADD on the health
sector.

'The technical wing, which was established on the directions of the minster for
CADD Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, will augment CADD's ability to administer health
services in a professional manner.'

The wing will perform development, monitoring and evaluation of technical
matters of all hospitals, matters relating to the quality assurance of services
provided by the hospitals and their planning and public health projects.

The wing will also oversee matters relating to the cooperation and coordination
with international agencies besides participating in international seminars and
workshops.

Furthermore, the wing will also provide input in matters relating to the
population welfare and population control.

No strike at UC hospitals on Monday; agreement is reached on contract

OAKLAND -- A planned strike of about 13,000 UC hospital workers starting Monday
has been cancelled, as a tentative contract agreement for patient care technical
workers has been reached.

The deal was struck Sunday morning after marathon bargaining sessions over the
weekend, both UC and union officials said.

The four-year agreement, which covers 13,000 patient care technical workers at
medical and student health centers, includes "union priorities of fair wage
increases, secure benefits, and staffing protections, while addressing UC's top
priority of pension reform," AFSCME said in a news release.

The agreement includes across-the-board and step increases totaling 24.5
percent, along with a ratification bonus, health rate freezes for lower-salaried
employees, and revised language on layoffs, UC officials said.

AFSCME officials said strike talks were prompted by UC's decision last summer to
impose contract terms that included new layoff powers.

"This proposed agreement reflects compromise on both sides, improves safety in
UC hospitals, and honors the important contributions to patient care technical
worker," AFSCME 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger said.

"There was true compromise by both sides to reach this agreement," said Dwaine
Duckett, UC vice president for human resources, in a news release. "This ends
nearly two years of very challenging negotiations and serves as a foundation for
UC and AFSCME to build on going forward."

The union will hold a ratification vote later this week.

"Our members are looking forward to ratifying this agreement, returning to work,
and doing what they do best -- caring for patients," Lybarger said.

Nigeria disburses 2m dollars to UN atomic agency to boost nuclear medicine
services

LENGTH: 453 words


Text of report by Folasade Folarin entitles "Nigeria Commits $2m to upgrade
nuclear medical services" published by private Nigerian newspaper The Guardian
website on 17 December

The Federal Government has released $2 million as counterpart funding to the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the expansion of Nuclear Medicine
Services to upgrade and strengthen radiotherapy services in 10 tertiary
hospitals.

Minister of Health, Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin, revealed this in Abuja while
receiving the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Ambassador Yukiya Amano, who is in Nigeria for a two-day working visit.

Coming on the heels of Nigeria's participation at the 53rd General Conference of
the IAEA held in Vienna, the delegation led by wife of the President, Hajia
Turai Yar'Adua, canvassed among others, technical cooperation between the IAEA
and the International Cancer Centre.

The outcome of this will ensure that nuclear medicine, radiotherapy upgrades, a
process of technical assistance to residents and other relevant health
personnel, would be in place in about 23 tertiary institutions in Nigeria.

Osotimehin, while reiterating government's continued commitment to the
realisation of the cancer project within the shortest possible time, also
solicited the agency's assistance in the areas of periodic capacity building,
cancer prevention education workshop and technical partnership, noting that
early detection will cut costs.

He noted that the government has outlined measures to make the system work,
stressing that the government demonstrates seriousness in harnessing
collaborative effort in terms of capacity building in partnership with the IAEA.

The first phase of the nuclear medicine projects will be available in the
University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, University of Nigeria Teaching
Hospital, Enugu, University of Port-Harcourt Teaching Hospital, the National
Hospital, Abuja and the Federal Medical Centre, Gombe, while the upgrading of
radiotherapy facilities will be carried out in the National Hospital, Abuja,
University of Calabar, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, among others.

Ambassador Amano described Nigeria as a "better partner" to IAEA because of his
leadership role and the impact the country made in neighbouring African
countries and the level of seriousness and commitment demonstrated in the fight
against cancer.

A first time visitor to Nigeria, Amano since his appointment as the director
general of IAEA, announced that 40 per cent of technical support of IAEA in
Nigeria is for the health sector and promised to advocate support for Nigeria in
the next Scientific Conference Agency.

14 KIDS IN HOSPITAL AFTER POPPING PILLS

BYLINE: Robin Perrie

LENGTH: 233 words


    Lad hands them out at school

    FOURTEEN teenagers were rushed to hospital after popping sleeping pills at
school.

    One lad swiped the tablets from his parents and handed them around to his
mates.

    The youngsters, aged 14 and 15, fell ill at home after classes ended for the
day. Anxious parents took them to hospital - and police were called in.

    The drama at Norham Community Technical College in North Shields, Tyneside,
came just a week after seven youngsters from a nearby estate nearly died through
swallowing a drink and drugs cocktail.

    The 14 from Norham College were all released from hospital within hours.

    But police said it could have been "an extremely serious incident".

    Suffer

    Chief Inspector Derek Scott added: "We took some calls in the evening and by
that time the youngsters had begun to suffer the effects of taking the tablets.

    "We are obviously very concerned that 14 youngsters ended up in hospital.
Although the drugs were fairly mild, they were not to know that."

    A local council spokesman said health and drug experts have contacted the
school to offer advice and support.

    Last week seven youths in Wallsend were taken to hospital after taking
cannabis, tranquilisers, sleeping pills and booze.

    They collapsed but were all released after treatment.

    Three youths have been arrested in connection with the supply of the drugs.

Preston hospital cancels appointments after IT glitch'

LENGTH: 355  words


ROYAL Preston Hospital cancelled an unknown' number of patients' appointments
today after a technical glitch with the computer system.

Hospital chiefs say that the issue could be fixed anytime in the next two to 24
hours so appointments booked for tomorrow may also be postponed.

It initially prompted fears the hospital was under a cyberattack.

But a spokesman for Lancashire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was quick to quash
the rumour saying that this was not the case and the technical problems pose no
risk to patient safety.

The spokesman confirmed that life-saving equipment in the hospital is not
affected.

They said the problems mean that the network has lost the ability to link all
its systems together.

In an official statement the Trust said: "This afternoon some of our IT systems
have been affected by a technical component which has malfunctioned.

"We have put in place our tried and tested contingency plans to minimise
disruption to ensure we can maintain services and continue to provide safe care
and treatment for our patients.

"These plans are working well and there's no risk to patient safety.

"We have postponed some outpatient clinics today and sincerely apologise to
everyone whose appointment has been affected.

"We will be in touch to reschedule these appointments as soon as possible.

"A team of IT experts are currently working on the issue and we expect the
system to be up and running within the next 24 hours."

The network began to malfunction at 3.30pm this afternoon.

Bosses at the Trust said they had no idea at this stage how many patient's
appointments have been cancelled'.

It is not the first time IT problems have caused the NHS to cancel appointments.
Only last month, hospitals across Lincolnshire were forced to shut down major
operations after a malware attack.

Hospitals in Scunthorpe and Grimsby found their IT networks had been infected at
the end of October and the Lincolnshire and Goole Trust called a major emergency
while the virus was dealt with.

And in September Leeds hospitals confirmed a crash in their pathology computer
systems led to non-urgent appointments being postponed.

A test of patience as new RAH stays empty until 2017

BYLINE: BRAD CROUCH MEDICAL REPORTER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 613  words


SOUTH Australians won't be able to use the new Royal Adelaide Hospital until
next year and the State Government won't even get the keys to the $2.1 billion
complex until this September, as new delays hit.

Building consortium HYLC has briefed stakeholders and the State Government on
its latest technical completion target, telling them it now looks like
mid-September, but without a firm date. It has missed three target dates so far
this year.

These delays have repeatedly pushed back the opening date for patients and
Health Minister Jack Snelling says the new target means plans for a belated
November 30 opening will now likely be abandoned.

Technical completion is when the Government takes ownership for three months of
testing to ensure the complex is built to specifications.

This latest timeline, combined with the complexity of shifting from the existing
RAH to the new building, means the new RAH is not expected to be operational
until well into 2017. Mr Snelling is taking the latest target with a grain of
salt after HYLC repeatedly missed its earlier stated targets.

"That is the builder's date, they have not had a great track record of providing
accurate dates in the past so we are independently assessing whether it is
realistic or not," he told The Advertiser.

"If it was to be September, it would be unlikely that we would be in the new
hospital by the end of the year.

"My main priority is we move into the hospital when it is safe to do so and it
is not rushed." The builders do not face any penalty for the delay.

The latest delay means a saving for the State Budget - the Government does not
begin paying SA Health Partnership the agreed $1 million a day until after the
three-month testing period.

SAHP is the project consortium responsible for the financing, design,
construction, commissioning and facility management under a public-private
partnership with a 35 year contract.

SAHP chief executive Duncan Jewell said builders HYLC - which is part of SAHP -
has submitted an updated Recovery Plan and Program which SAHP and the State
Government are reviewing.

"Until this review is complete and all parties agree, no updated technical
completion date for the new RAH can be set," he said.

"Technical completion marks the point at which the state can commence clinical
commissioning, scenario and staff training sessions that lead to Commercial
Acceptance, and ultimately the handing over of the facility to the state.

"As the project nears completion, additional resources continue to be employed
on site, and will do so until technical completion is achieved, with every
effort to progress the works in a timely and safe manner." Meanwhile, the
troubled EPAS system will "go live" at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital on June 29.

Central Adelaide Local Health Network chief executive Julia Squire has told
staff the $422 million electronic patient record system will be "a major
improvement to how we deliver care".

"The hospital will be the first Central Adelaide Local Health Network site to
'Go-Live' with EPAS and the eighth site to be activated across South Australia,"
she told staff in a memo seen by The Advertiser.

Opposition health spokesman Stephen Wade said EPAS was an ongoing fiasco. "EPAS
is a slow moving train wreck threatening patient care and the state budget," he
said.

"EPAS is currently $200 million over budget. It was meant to be operating in 10
metropolitan hospitals two years ago - it is currently only operating in two.

"The QEH will be first large hospital to receive EPAS and doctors have expressed
alarm at the risks - this is the biggest test that EPAS has faced yet."TIMELAPSE

HOW GEORGIA STOCKS FARED;
Electronics distributor subject of large trade

BYLINE: Tom Walker; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 04F Tom Walker

LENGTH: 589 words


A single block of shares representing 16 percent of the outstanding stock in
Southern Electronics (ticker symbol SECX) was traded on Tuesday.

The transaction involving approximately 1.19 million shares was recorded at 1:08
p.m. in the Nasdaq market. By day's end, trading in Tucker-based Southern
Electronics totaled about 2.19 million shares, compared with a three-month
average of 18,255 shares.

The share price lost 18 3/4 cents to $ 6.56 1/4.

Company officials were unavailable for comment. But analyst Mark C. Jordan of
A.G. Edwards said venture capitalists may have been responsible for the trade.

"It's hard to tell at this point whether it was a (buy or sell) transaction, or
a stock distribution," said Jordan. "There have been some long-term venture
capitalists investing in this company recently."

Southern Electronics distributes microcomputers, computer peripherals, video
products, disk drives, terminals and cellular telephones.

The company on Friday reported net income of 23 cents a share for the fourth
quarter, against a loss of 17 cents a share, including a special charge, in the
year-earlier period.

Jordan said he looks for "a good year of growth" for the company in fiscal 1997.

Elsewhere, the shares of Magellan Health Services (MGL) traded at a 52-week low
for the second straight session following a disappointing earnings report. The
Atlanta-based company, which operates psychiatric hospitals, traded at $ 15.75
before closing at $ 15.87 1/2, down $ 1.62 1/2.

Analysts at two Wall Street brokerages downgraded their ratings Tuesday: to
"underperform" from "market perform" at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities,
and to "accumulate" from "buy" at Dean Witter Reynolds.

Magellan Health Services (formerly Charter Medical) on Monday reported a
third-quarter net loss of 18 cents per share after taking a total of $ 34
million in charges to settle billing disputes and close three hospitals. The
company also noted pressure on prices is continuing.

The best traffic month in its history did not help Delta Air Lines (DAL)
overcome investor reluctance to buy airline stocks. Its shares fell $ 1.62 1/2
to $ 71.62 1/2 despite an 11 percent jump in July traffic and an increase to
almost 75 percent in airplane occupancy from 69 percent in 1995.

The recent crash of a TWA jetliner and the imminent restoration of a 10 percent
federal ticket tax have plagued airline stocks.

Norrell (NRL), a temporary help firm, rose 50 cents to $ 29.87 1/2 after
announcing the acquisition of American Technical Resources, a McLean, Va.-based
provider of information technology support services with 1996 revenue estimated
at $ 40 million.

Georgia-Pacific (GP) lost 37 1/2 cents to $ 75.87 1/2. The forest products giant
said it will sell its gypsum wallboard plants in Buchanan, N.Y., and Wilmington,
Del., to Lafarge for undisclosed terms. The Justice Department required the sale
because of Georgia-Pacific's deal to buy the gypsum operations of Domtar.

Premiere Technologies (PTEK), a software company, rose 25 cents to $ 27 after
J.C. Bradford analysts increased their rating to "strong buy" from "buy."

Suburban Lodges of America (SLAM), a hotel developer that went public May 23,
jumped $ 2.50 to $ 23.87 1/2 after reporting a second- quarter profit of 8 cents
per share.

Weeks (WKS), a real estate investment trust and developer that last week agreed
to acquire a Nashville development company in a $ 120.7 million deal, closed at
a new high of $ 27.25, up 50 cents.

The Buckhead Home Depot is in search of a larger location, says Home Depot
spokesperson Jerry Shields. The Piedmont Road location suffers from its own
success: at under 80,000 square feet, it's small compared to newer facilities of
102,000 square feet.

"The size was dictated by the land," says Shields. The parking lot is cramped
and no left turns are allowed off Piedmont into the property. "It's a good
store; we'd like it to handle business better," says Shields.

No deal has been struck for a new site, he says. There's been speculation Home
Depot's looking at a site near Georgia 400.

Adult industry targeted

The Buckhead Coalition, a group of business leaders, is throwing its support
behind moves to put more controls on all forms of adult entertainment, including
lingerie modeling and escort services.

The group recently petitioned the Atlanta City Council to adopt tighter controls
on these types of businesses.

It said it is troubled by the experiences in other communities where adult
entertainment has been associated with disorderly conduct and prostitution.

"The time to promulgate tighter regulations is before the proliferation protects
proprietors under 'grandfather' clauses," said Julian LeCraw, the coalition's
chairman.

Fund-raiser under way

The Kroger Co.'s fourth annual Kroger Children's Challenge is under way. It runs
through Oct. 30 and raises money for children's hospitals in Georgia, Alabama
and South Carolina.

Each time a customer purchases products marked with Kroger Children's Challenge
signs, Kroger and its vendors donate money to the hospitals.

In the past three years, more than $ 1 million has been donated to Egleston and
Scottish Rite children's hospitals in Atlanta, as well as other children's
hospitals across Georgia and South Carolina.

EMERGENCY AT ROYAL ADELAIDE

BYLINE: REBECCA PUDDY

SECTION: INQUIRER; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 1916  words


Costs mount and battles rage over new hospital

Today the doors of the nation's most expensive building, the -imposing 10-storey
Royal Adelaide Hospital, standing tall on the banks of the River Torrens, should
swing open to receive patients.

The $2.3 billion facility, which has earnt the accolade of the world's third
most expensive building (after New York's One World Trade Centre and Bucharest's
Palace of the Parliament), is set to be Australia's first paperless hospital
delivering state-of-the-art healthcare, with private rooms and lush gardens.

But in reality, the site remains a 24-hour building site, a mecca for workers in
hard hats and high-vis vests. Delays and mistakes in the building of the
nation's most -advanced hospital have continually pushed back deadlines,
prompting a bitter legal battle -between the state government and its builders.

Today is meant to be another milestone for the 800-bed facility, the day the
keys are to be handed to the state Labor government, after the initial January
deadline was extended.

Instead, construction conglomerate Hansen Yuncken Leighton Contractors and the
-operators of the hospital, SA Health Partnership, are in court arguing with the
government over the many defects that cannot be fixed. Now, the promise is that
the works will be completed by March.

The disaster is labelled a "vanity project" and its stuff ups "the stuff of
comedy", and that is just the Australian Medical Association's assessment.

The defects and the delays come on top of a looming safety crisis, amid concerns
that the electronic -patient record system for the -paperless hospital will not
be ready. With ward floors not strong enough to withstand the weight of paper
records, the government is still to reveal its plans to store them off-site.

Of the key defects, The Australian can reveal that nine are deemed unfixable.
They include room sizes, ceiling heights, ventilation for a nuclear medicine
laboratory, room temperature, fresh air control and poorly laid floor vinyl. The
builder contends that the -alleged defects pose no or limited loss in
functionality.

They are on top of additional costs caused by unexpected con--tamination of a
section once part of Adelaide's railyards, the failure of the building's
condenser water system and the replacement of fixtures following internal
flooding.

Health Minister Jack Snelling says there is no date for when the new hospital
will open.

"As we have said before, no -decisions will be made about the timing of the
hospital move until we have confidence that the -timelines provided to us are
realistic and reliable," Snelling says. "The state government will not pay one
cent in service payments until commercial acceptance has been achieved." Since
the building was commissioned in 2011, its construction costs alone have nearly
doubled, from $244.7 million to more than $417m.

For its part, the construction consortium blames the state government for the
delays, accusing it of failing to meet time frames and modifying project
requirements.

The builder has unsuccessfully sought more than $500m in compensation for the
delays.

The finger-pointing in South Australia follows similar experiences in Western
Australia, where the builders of the $2bn 783-bed Fiona Stanley Hospital
abandoned plans to develop the state's first paperless hospital, which opened in
late 2014 nearly a year behind schedule. A post-build -review found the ambition
to create a paperless hospital went "a step too far" and time frames were
optimistic. Hospital contractor Serco was paid $118.8m to provide services to a
hospital that was empty for the first six months and then substantially
under-utilised for another half year.

Commercially sensitive documents obtained by The Australian show similar
problems are arising in South Australia with staff -employed by hospital
contractor Spotless. One proposal includes putting staff to work in the new
Royal Adelaide Hospital kitchens and then transporting the meals across the city
to the present -hospital.

Now the $1.2bn Perth Children's Hospital is under the microscope, with WA
Auditor General Colin Murphy investigating its building contracts. That build is
at least one year behind schedule and asbestos was found in roof panels imported
from China.

AMA president Michael Gannon says the lessons learned in WA and SA should be
considered a cautionary tale for other states looking to replace their ageing
health infrastructure. "Other state and territory governments will need to be
very careful and constrain their ambitions on these vanity projects," he says.
"There have been basic design mistakes in all of these hospital builds." The
Royal Adelaide Hospital's inability to hold paper records "would be the stuff of
comedy if it wasn't true", he says.

In 2014, the nation's top hospital chief executives met in Melbourne to discuss
the massive disconnect between the aspirations for new hospitals and what was
actually delivered, identifying the rapid move towards digital hospitals and new
IT systems as key risks.

SA opposition health spokesman Stephen Wade describes the Royal Adelaide
Hospital build as a "rolling disaster".

"It is already seven months -behind schedule and $640m over budget," he says.
"The hospital is an impressive health asset but I have deep concerns that Labor
is unable to deliver quality healthcare. Their poorly thought out plans for
outpatients, electronic patient records, clinical research and a reduction in
cardiac beds are just the tip of the iceberg of an -unfolding health disaster."
Last month, Minister Snelling, barely concealing his anger, said the government
had lost patience with the builders and had no confidence in their deadlines. In
a show of brinkmanship, he said a dispute with the builders over fixing -defects
would be hashed out in the state's Supreme Court.

"The position they've been trying to arrive at is one where we -accept the
hospital and start moving patients in and, most importantly, start paying for a
hospital, and some of the defects we leave to be fixed up after we've moved in.
Now that's just not acceptable," he told reporters.

"We're sick of being mucked around by the consortium. We want to send an
unambiguous message to SAHP that we will not be accepting a hospital that's
anything other than first best." For Premier Jay Weatherill's government,
further delay to the hospital opening affects Labor's positioning before the
2018 election, with pundits predicting a close result.

Next June is now the earliest the government can start moving patients - peak
flu season. Both the nurses' union and public hospital doctors' -asso-cia-tion
say they will oppose an -attempt to shift hospitals in winter, when demand for
hospital services is at its highest.

Australian Nurses and Midwifery Federation state president Elizabeth Dabars says
it will be "particularly dangerous" to move hospitals in winter. "We would be
opposing that. Fundamentally in order to make a safe transition you need to have
the best possible scenario," Dabars says. "On its face, it is the most
inappropriate time of the year." The government and SAHP -return to the Supreme
Court next Friday in an attempt to negotiate a way for the government to accept
the hospital defects, especially those that cannot be fixed.

UNHEALTHY PROGRESS July 2007 South Australian government decides to build new
Royal Adelaide Hospital at a cost of $1.7 billion.

May 20, 2011 Contract signed between SA Health Partnership and state government
to design, construct and finance new Royal Adelaide Hospital and provide
specified services for 30 years of its operations. Contract runs until 2046 and
foreshadows a five-year build, including a technical completion date of January

Union confident it will survive

BYLINE: Jeff Tucker, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 264 words


Aug. 20--The union representing 73 employees at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center
said recently that it believes it will survive a decertification election.

"The National Labor Relations Board only requires 30 percent of the workers to
sign a decertification petition in order to trigger an election," said Al
Kogler, District 7 administrative director for the Communication Workers of
America. "We are very confident there is still strong majority support for union
representation at St. Mary-Corwin and welcome the chance to prove it through an
election."

Employees at the hospital filed a petition to decertify the union, which
represents positions in a number of the hospital's support departments.

The hospital said it supported the election and said the employees would get the
opportunity to vote once "blocking charges" were investigated by the NLRB.

But Kogler said the charge was filed in 2012 over previous negotiations and
decisions in that case were appealed by the hospital.

He said the union and the hospital are trying to negotiate a settlement and if
successful, an election will be held then.

The CWA's collective bargaining unit covers positions in the nutrition services,
environmental services, patient scheduling, maintenance and facilities, clinical
support, technical and technical support departments.

The hospital's threeyear collective bargaining agreement with the union is set
to expire this year.

VA hospital adds outpatient clinic in St. Petersburg

BYLINE: KRIS MAYES

SECTION: CITY & STATE; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 388 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



In an effort to reach more veterans, the VA Medical Center at Bay Pines will
add a satellite health clinic on 34th Street S in St. Petersburg.

A second VA clinic is on the drawing board for Clearwater, but a location  has
not been chosen, officials said.

"Our theory is we serve a lot of clients and there are more we could serve  if
they could get to us," said VA spokesman Laurence Christman. "We know  that some
people can't drive, don't have a car and so you need to be close to  where the
bus lines are, close to where people work and live."

The St. Petersburg clinic, which will be based at the St. Petersburg campus  of
Pinellas Technical Education Centers at Eighth Avenue and 34 Street S, is
scheduled to open July 15. It will have four examination rooms staffed by a
physician, a registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse and two clerical
workers.

The agreement between the VA and the Pinellas County school district, which
owns PTEC, was signed April 28. In return for the space, PTEC students and
teachers will be offered training by VA staff members in areas such as medical
ethics, AIDS/HIV, pathophysiology, pharmacology and information management.

The VA and the school district have another agreement under which the VA
sponsors training courses for the Pinellas County School to Work program,  which
seeks to make connections between academic and work experiences.

VA officials said the satellite expansion is designed to meet a growing  demand
for outpatient services rather than in-patient hospital stays.

For instance, in 1995 the Bay Pines medical center had 11,899 admissions,
compared with 10,946 in 1996, fewer than 10,000 in 1997 and fewer than 9,000  so
far in 1998. By contrast, the VA expects to exceed 370,000 outpatient  visits
for fiscal year 1998, which ends in December. The center had 225,941  outpatient
visits in 1996 and approximately 240,000 outpatient visits in 1997.

"We keep going down . . . (on) inpatient visits, but our ambulatory care  keeps
going up," Christman said.

Inviting the VA onto campus "serves the community and it's going to give  us an
opportunity," said PTEC director Warren Laux. "It's a win-win for  everybody."

The clinic will take appointments only. Veterans may call 398-6661, ext.  7639
for information.

Special cancer hospital in limbo

BYLINE: Daulat Rahman

LENGTH: 492  words


Dispur misses deadlines for institute, building costs escalate

Guwahati, Dec. 18: Dispur has been missing one deadline after another to
inaugurate a super-speciality cancer hospital here, at a time when cancer is
spreading fast in Assam.

The BJP-led government, soon after taking charge in May this year, had assured
that a cancer hospital would be inaugurated at the earliest.

The state government had even procured a PET-CT scanner system, along with a
cyclotron, to detect cancer at a very early stage, spending several crores of
rupees for the proposed hospital.

On August 18 this year, health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the 200-bed
cancer hospital at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital would be inaugurated
on October 2.

Sources told The Telegraph that more than two months after missing the October 2
deadline, the state government is still nowhere close to inaugurating the
hospital.

"Doctors, nurses and other technical and non-technical staff, required to run a
super-speciality cancer hospital, are yet to be appointed by the government for
reasons best known to it. The government recently gave an advertisement to fill
up certain posts of technical staff," a source said.

Sarma, who was the health minister in the erstwhile Congress regime as well,
announced in 2008 that construction of the proposed speciality hospital at a
cost of Rs 52 crore would be completed within March 31, 2009.

Dispur had missed the first deadline and accordingly, the construction cost of
the hospital escalated.

On January 10, 2010, Sarma again announced that the cancer hospital would be
completed during the last part of 2011 at an estimated cost of Rs 85 crore.

After missing the 2011 deadline, Dispur again continued with fresh deadlines
only to miss those.

On January 5 last year, the then health minister Nazrul Islam said the cancer
hospital would start functioning from April.

The deadline again remained unfulfilled till Sarma declared an October 2
deadline after becoming the health minister in the BJP government in May this
year.

Sources said the development was a matter of serious concern as the state -
having the highest number of cancer cases in the country - lacks both machines
and manpower for cancer treatment.

According to the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO), one
tele-therapy machine is required per 10 lakh population.

For the 3.1 crore population of Assam, there is a requisition of 30 such
machines and the state has only nine machines at present.

The B. Borooah Cancer Institute (BBCI), the lone full-fledged cancer care
organisation, is now overburdened with patients from different parts of the
region.

Sources said patients have to wait for long to get beds in the institute. Under
such circumstances, patients who can afford the treatment, are moving outside
Assam for treatment. Those who cannot, run from pillar to post for cancer care
in Assam due to non-availability of adequate treatment facilities, a source
said.

Uniabuja Hospital Sensitizes Staff on Cleanliness

BYLINE: Abubakar Sadiq Isah

LENGTH: 332  words


THE University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH), Gwagwalada in collaboration
with Aids Support and Technical Assistance Resources (AIDSTAR) last Thursday
organised a two- day campaign for staff of the hospital on the importance of
washing hands after attending to patients.

In his welcome address, Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Peter Alabi,
said the hand washing campaign is an annual event that is promoted by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as well as Making Medical Injection Safety Initiative
(MMSI) to train hospital staff, those in the medical section on the need to wash
their hands after attending to patients.

According to him, the hospital has always observed the annual hand washing
campaign for the past four to five years, which he said has created awareness
inside the hospital's community.

He explained that hand washing is a very important vehicle that helps in
avoiding a lot of infections after attending to patient, saying after each
contact either through direct handling of a patient or through materials, it is
adviced that such medical personnel should wash his or her hands thoroughly.

"We don't want a situation where a patient that comes to the hospital gets
infected through our own contact and we don't also want to get infected through
any contact," he said.

The chief medical director however said that the hospital provides liquid
detergents, especially alcohol base liquid detergent and running water for such
purposes.

Earlier, the head of logistic of Aids Support and Technical Assistance Resources
(AIDSTAR), Pharmacy Bala Muazu, said the aim and objective of the hand washing
campaign is to bring people together on May 5th yearly to make commitments'
towards enhancing a hygienic society by sustaining the action on hand hygiene.

"Hand hygiene is very essential in health service delivery and it is only when
you have proper health care facility that passes hygiene, you are likely to
reduce a lot of patients' infection in hospitals," he said.

Angry over lost benefit, Temple nurses, techs picket

BYLINE: By Chris Mondics; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; P-com Biz; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 416 words


Shouting slogans and hoisting placards, hundreds of Temple University Hospital
nurses and technical employees walked a picket line Thursday amid a standoff
over management demands for benefit cuts and other union concessions.

Some 1,500 nurses and technical staff walked off their jobs on Wednesday,
incensed that the hospital had eliminated a popular tuition assistance program
and had failed to add nurses in what they described as understaffed units, among
other grievances.

"It's a matter of respect," said nurse Lisa Antenucci. "They broke the contract
that we had, and we don't feel they will keep the contract that we will get."

The hospital, which brought in 850 replacement workers to staff the hospital
during the strike, said that patient care had been unaffected and that the
hospital was providing all of its normal services on Thursday.

Rebecca Harmon, spokeswoman for the Temple University Health System, said the
tuition benefit, for dependent children, had been eliminated for all hospital
employees, including the striking members of the Pennsylvania Association of
Staff Nurses & Allied Professionals (PASNAP). She said the employees themselves
still were eligible for the tuition benefit.

"This is not something that applies only to PASNAP; this is throughout the
house," Harmon said.

The nurses and technical staff, who have been working without a contract since
September, marched outside the hospital with placards that read "We Demand
Respect and Recognition" and "Nurses On Strike For Respect." Motorists
periodically sounded their horns in encouragement.

The nurses have warned that bringing on new staff will cause patient care to
suffer. But a brief tour of the hospital Thursday revealed no obvious sign of
dysfunction. At a nursing station on the fifth floor of the hospital's west
wing, three nurses sat in front of computer monitors as physicians strolled
unhurriedly past.

In a waiting area on the first floor, one young woman who declined to give her
name, had brought her father in for a blood test. She said the wait seemed
unusually long, about an hour and half. But the atmosphere in the room, indeed,
throughout the hospital, seemed calm and orderly.

Harmon said there had been no contact between hospital management and the union,
although she said that the hospital had been in contact with a state appointed
mediator. Both sides said they had no indication when direct talks might begin.

A THANK-you and farewell dinner was held for former Gympie Hospital
superintendent Dr Mark Waters and former Hospital Board chairman Peter
Hardcastle, SM, recently. Both have resigned from their positions and the Waters
have moved to Ipswich. The Hardcastles are remaining in Gympie. Both men were
presented with a gift.

THE familiar sight around Gympie of a man wearing a towelling hat with a camera
slung around his neck will be missing from today. Yes, you have guessed it.
Keith Brown, or as he is affectionately known "~Flashbulb Brownie,' is retiring.
Mr Brown who has worked as a photographer for The Gympie Times since 1954 has
decided to call it quits. He is also retiring from his position as a law clerk
at the Gympie firm of Jeffery and Cuddihy. Mr Brown's interest in photography
began while he was a student at Gympie State High School. He said that you could
buy a Box Brownie then for about 50c and printing paper was a shilling (10c) a
packet, but that was still a lot of money for those days. When he began taking
photographs professionally he was shooting a couple of ten by eights
(photographs) each week. Gympie Times editor Michael Roser said Mr Brown had
contributed greatly to the success of newspaper over the past 34 years.

THE possibility of more practical training for apprentices emerged from a
meeting in Gympie on Thursday, attended by representatives of the Technical
College Board, Gympie Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, Mr A.M. Hodges, MLA,
and the Director of Technical Education. It is understood the opinion of the
meeting was that it might be possible in the near future to institute fulltime
day and evening training for woodwork apprentices and to make arrangements for
apprentice motor mechanics, fitters and turners and plumbers to do practical
work one day a month at the Maryborough Technical College.

YELLOW Cabs, Gympie, comes into operation officially today with a radio-control
hook-up operation from 247 Mary Street, phone 2-2255. Ten local taxi owners have
amalgamated to form Yellow Cabs, Gympie and members with distinctively painted
cars will operate from all three city taxi ranks. By group operation and working
by radio-control these taxi owners feel that they can give the public a reliable
and efficient service.

100 years ago

IT IS stated by an old and consistent visitor to the Noosa Heads that the mail
services between that place and Tewantin is most unsatisfactory as it occupied
the best part of a week to get a reply to a letter sent from Gympie to the
Heads. By some peculiar arrangement the mailbag leaves the Heads for Tewantin on
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday about 3pm returning from Tewantin with the mail
for the Heads about 7pm. The answer to any letter thus received cannot be sent
until the afternoon of the second day, unless by special messenger. The remedy
suggested is that there should be a daily mail service to the Heads upon the
arrival of the mail coach at Tewantin and that the return mail (also daily)
should reach Tewantin next morning sufficiently early to catch the mail coach
leaving for the Cooroy railway station. It is also suggested that residents and
visitors should sign a petition asking for the desired alteration.

A TEAM of cricketers from Gympie representing the Gordon Club visited Cooroy
last Saturday and met the local club on the sports ground wicket. Cooroy batted
first and were not disposed of till late in the afternoon for 152 (Rees 38,
Wheeldon 34, and Ronalds 31, being the top scorers for Cooroy). The Gordons with
a limited time at the wicket knocked up 94 for three wickets (Bruce Smith 23,
Steve Smith not out 31, and J. Donovon not out 30). The match was consequently
declared a draw. During the Cooroy innings, Rinilds hit three fives and Wheeldon
1, while for Gordons, Donovan hit two consecutive fives.

THE local croquet and tennis courts in the Park are at present undergoing a
complete process of top-dressing and planting with couch grass.

Hospital claims loss of EUR 0.4m in fraud

SECTION: IRELAND; In the Courts; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 452 words


DUBLIN S BEAUMONT Hospital has claimed it suffered losses of more than EUR
400,000 as a result of an alleged conspiracy by a former technical services
manager and others to forge tenders so as to ensure contracts were awarded to a
particular building company, now in liquidation.

The hospital alleges Douglas Browne, Kiltipper Drive, Aylesbury Estate, Dublin
24, had conspired with AMS Construction Limited, in liquidation, with registered
offices at Walkinstown, Dublin, and its directors and owners, Adrian Millar,
Glenlyon Crescent, Knocklyon, Dublin, and Michael Shortt, Aylmer Park, Naas, Co
Kildare, to falsify tenders resulting in the hospital losing about EUR 413,324.

The defendants deny the claims. The case came before the Master of the High
Court Edmund Honohan yesterday who made a number of discovery orders concerning
the defendants  bank statements and other documents.

It is alleged that, from 1997 to 2001, Mr Browne conspired with the other
defendants to cause contracts to be awarded to AMS by preparing and submitting
falsified or forged tenders on behalf of third parties. It claims Mr Browne
personally benefited.

The hospital is claiming damages on grounds of alleged fraudulent
misrepresentation, deceit, breach of trust and breach of contract and unjust
enrichment.

The hospital claims it engaged Mr Browne as technical services manager in 1997.
After he resigned following inquiries resulting from an internal audit,
investigations revealed that Mr Browne had altered a certificate issued by the
South African Council for Professional Engineers, the hospital said.

In an affidavit, Liam Duffy, chief executive of the hospital, said an
examination of eight contracts awarded to AMS Construction Limited during the
years 1999 to 2000 had disclosed that, in five cases, purported tenders were on
file from entities that either did not exist or denied having submitted any
tenders.

Mr Duffy said a review by an independent quantity surveyor of those eight
contracts had indicated AMS had been paid some EUR 400,000 more than the value
of the works and an allowance for a reasonable profit margin.

In his defence, Mr Browne denies the claims and pleads they are statute barred.
He admitted he had represented he was an engineer registered by the South
African Council for Professional Engineers when this was not the case but denied
this was done fraudulently or with intent to defraud.

He claims it was very difficult to interest building firms in working on small
contracts and that the general manager was fully informed of the manner in which
tenders were obtained.

In their defence, AMS and its directors deny the claims against them and deny
they induced Mr Browne to act in breach of his contract.

Kiwanis Collects Toys For Sick Kids

Tampa Bay Technical High School students join the effort.

By JOYCE McKENZIE

jmckenzie@tampatrib.com

TEMPLE TERRACE - With the economy in a slump, more and more people are finding
it difficult to make ends meet. The problem can be particularly prevalent in
families where there are major medical expenses.

No matter the circumstances, the Temple Terrace Kiwanis Club wants to make
certain Santa visits every child in the greater Tampa Bay area - especially
those in children's hospitals.

To accomplish that goal, the club, in partnership with the Key Club at Tampa Bay
Technical High School and Live@Home, a business that provides caregivers for the
elderly and infirmed, is sponsoring a toy drive..

Kiwanis president-elect Jamie Klingman, Live@Home owner and toy drive
coordinator, said the club had two reasons for selecting the project:

* Kiwanis was founded on the principle of serving of children.

* Because parents of ill youngsters often face exorbitant medical bills, they
are left with little or no money to pay for anything but the essentials.

Unwrapped new or like-new items may be dropped off at the Greater Temple Terrace
Chamber of Commerce office, Tampa Bay Tech or Live@Home. The toys will be
collected, wrapped and distributed by local representatives from Children's
Miracle Network, a global alliance of 170 hospitals.

"We've been assured that gifts will stay locally," Klingman said.

Temple Terrace Kiwanian Terry Mishler said he intends to provide as many gifts
as he can.

"More and more people are in need. So we need to step forward even more than
ever," Mishler said.

"I think this particular event is in keeping with our mission to serve the
children of the world," said Joe Gross, a club director.

Debra Conn, a Tampa Bay Tech guidance counselor and the Key Club sponsor, said
the students are having fun with the project.

The Key Club is the high school equivalent of the Kiwanis Club.

"Some of them have brought in some really nice things," she said. "They are
especially enjoying it knowing the toys are going to kids in the hospital and
that they will help them both physically and emotionally."

Park Ridge news briefs: Oncologist, molecular biologist named to Maine South's
alumni Wall of Honor

BYLINE: Jennifer Johnson, Pioneer Press Newspapers, Suburban Chicago

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 873 words


Aug. 28--Names added to 2017 Maine South Wall of Honor

Maine South High School has announced that Dr. Ravi Salgia and the late Dr.
Susan Lindquist are the 2017 inductees to the school's alumni Wall of Honor.

Salgia, a 1977 Maine South graduate, is a medical oncologist, researcher and
professor, specializing in lung cancer. In 2016, he joined City of Hope, a
cancer research hospital in Duarte, Calif., as a professor and chairman of the
Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, according to the
hospital's website.

The University of Chicago, where Salgia has also spent time as a professor,
called Salgia "an expert in thoracic oncology" -- the treatment of lung cancer.
Maine South, in a news release, reported that Salgia's life's work "has led to a
variety of therapies that are matched to and most effective for any particular
stage of lung cancer."

A 1967 graduate of Maine South, Dr. Susan Lindquist was a molecular biologist,
professor and researcher. She died in 2016 at age 67.

According to her obituary in the New York Times, Lindquist's work with yeast
proteins "opened new avenues to understanding gene functioning and degenerative
diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's." Maine South noted that Lindquist's
career "is all the more noteworthy because it was launched in an era when women
in science research were few and far between."

Both Salgia and Lindquist will be honored during a Sept. 21 dinner at Cafe La
Cave in Des Plaines.

Maine South's Wall of Honor was launched in 2013, and new names are added every
two years based on nominations.

Other alumni who appear on the Wall of Honor are Hillary Clinton, Pulitzer
Price-winning journalist Patricia Callahan, climate scientist Nathan Hultman,
attorney and former federal judge Mark Filip, and former Microsoft executive Ray
Ozzie.

District 207 superintendent named 'Champion of the Year'

Ken Wallace, superintendent of Maine Township High School District 207, was
recently named 2018 Champion of the Year by the Association for Career and
Technical Education and its board of directors, the district announced.

According to ACTE, the Champion of the Year Award is given to individuals who
have contributed to "the improvement, promotion, development and progress of
career and technical education."

ACTE's announcement of Wallace's selection referenced District 207 as the first
school district in the world to partner with Google and use Google applications
and email for educational purposes; Tech Insider's naming of District 207 as
"one of the 14 most innovative school districts in America;" and Wallace's
emphasis on career exploration for students, which has included an expanded
student internship program (reportedly growing by 126 percent over the past two
years) and the hiring of a career coordinator.

"Schools offer students flexibility in their schedules that allows them to take
advantage of shadow days, job fairs, career panels and non-traditional
internships," the district said in a statement. "[Wallace] has also integrated
career readiness into the district's counseling programs, grading system and
curriculum development."

Wallace will be recognized with other national ACTE award winners on Dec. 6
during the annual ACTE Awards Banquet in Nashville. The banquet is taking place
during ACTE's CareerTech Vision 2017, which features thousands of career and
technical education professionals from around the country.

Advocate Lutheran General Hospital ranked on 'Best Hospitals List'

Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge was ranked 8th within the top
10 hospitals in the state on a new "Best Hospitals List" published by U.S. News
and World Report.

Lutheran General tied with University of Chicago Medical Center for the 8th spot
out of more than 200 Illinois hospitals, and was ranked 7th among hospitals in
the Chicago metro area, according to the publication.

Nationally, the hospital was ranked 42nd in gastroenterology and GI surgery, and
given a "high performing" rating in colon cancer surgery, hip and knee
replacements, heart failure treatment, and treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

U.S. News and World Report ranked Northwestern Memorial Hospital as the top
hospital in the state, followed by Rush University Medical Center and Loyola
University Medical Center.

An explanation of how hospitals are ranked can be found on the publication's
website.

Changes made to police 'Text a Tip' program

The Park Ridge Police Department has announced changes in its anonymous "Text a
Tip" program due to the selection of a new vendor.

To provide an anonymous tip to police, enter the number 888777 in the phone
number area and start the text message with TIP ICARE, the police department
said. In the text field, tipsters are asked to provide "as much information as
possible," including exact locations.

All tips remain anonymous, according to the department.

Emergencies and in-progress crimes should continue to be reported by calling
911, police said.

Nursing shortage draws adults to training programs

BYLINE: MARIE DONOVAN, Sun Correspondent

SECTION: TODAY'S HEADLINES

LENGTH: 690 words

DATELINE: TYNGSBORO


http://extras.mnginteractive.com

Francis Gatui, a Kenyan native who moved to Lowell five years ago, is part of a
growing trend.

Gatui decided at age 35 to enroll in Greater Lowell Technical High School's
daytime program in licenced practical nursing so he could land a steady job,
after having difficulty keeping work as an electrical engineer, despite solid
qualifications.

"I got really frustrated getting laid off, and I couldn't find a job," Gatui
said.

With a 1-year-old son already, and his wife Angelica pregnant with the couple's
second child, Gatui was concerned he would not be able to support them.

"Having a family, I needed stability," Gatui said.

That stability, fueled by a growing demand for nurses, is attracting more adults
to the profession. And yes, many of them today are male.

"We have a lot more men in nursing and health care, in general," said Nancy
Harrington, nursing program director at Greater Lowell Tech.

Because of a shortage of nurses fueled by both the aging of America and
hospitals' efforts to streamline costs by redelegating work formerly performed
by physicians, "it's one of those professions where you're going to have a job
all the time," Harrington said.

According to the Burlington-based Massachusetts Hospital Association, the
current vacancy rate statewide for licensed practical nurses [LPNs] is at 6.4
percent. While that is down from a high of 14.2 percent in 2002, the rate shows
steady employment opportunities still exist for graduates of LPN programs like
those offered by both Greater Lowell Tech and Shawsheen Valley Technical High
School in Billerica. Nashoba Valley Technical High School in Westford does not
have an LPN program.

Tuition for Greater Lowell Tech's 10-month LPN program is $4,900 for in-district
students and $5,700 for out-of-district students, Harrington said. After
finishing the program, graduates can earn $28 to $30 per hour working as nurses
at area hospitals and nursing homes.

As a result of the nationwide nursing shortage, both Greater Lowell Tech and
Shawsheen Tech have had a big uptick in interest for their adult LPN programs in
recent years, school officials said. Tuition for Shawsheen's program, which also
runs 10 months, is $6,900.

This year, Greater Lowell Tech received about 500 applications, Harrington said.

Of those applicants, the school could only enroll 80 total, between its day and
evening courses, she said.

At Shawsheen Tech, Community Services Director Roger Bourgeois said the school
could only enroll 40 students in its evening adult LPN program, out of about 150
applicants, so only the most talented are admitted.

"It's a rigorous program," Bourgeois said.

Greater Lowell Tech's program is rigorous too, said nursing student Brandy Nash,
24, of Lowell, but well worth the effort.

"The classes are all fast-paced, but you've just got to push yourself," Nash
said.

Students in Greater Lowell Tech's LPN program learn to administer medications,
change surgical dressings, monitor IV machines and fluid intakes, administer
catheterizations -- virtually everything a registered nurse does, minus the
patient assessment and treatment assignation, Harrington said. They also train
at area hospitals, including both Saints Memorial Medical Center and Lowell
General, in addition to doctors' offices and nursing homes, she said.

Nash has worked for Heritage Nursing Care Center in Lowell as both an activities
aide and an administrative assistant for the Social Services Department, since
her 1999 high-school graduation from Greater Lowell.

Heritage is paying Nash's tuition to the LPN program, in the hopes she can
expand her responsibilities with the company in the future.

"There are just so many opportunities in the medical field. I definitely love
long term care," Nash said.

With job opportunities in many other fields slim these days, it's no wonder the
waiting lists for both Greater Lowell and Shawsheen's LPN programs are so long,
Bourgeois said.

"It's a huge market now, it's such a huge shortage nationwide. They just can't
keep up with the demands."

Oxygen supply disruption in CMC: Three held responsible

SECTION: KOCHI

LENGTH: 665 words


KOCHI: A preliminary investigation by Kochi Co-operative Medical College
authorities has found three persons morally responsible for the shortage of
oxygen supply in the hospital.

The two-member committee consisting of Dr P G R Pillai, medical advisor, and Dr
Mohan P Sam, medical director, however, found that the death of three patients
was due to their illness and not due to disruption in oxygen supply, as alleged
by the nurses' union.

The committee has asked Dr K G R Mallan, medical superintendent of the hospital,
to step down from the post. Rajesh, the technical assistant who was in charge of
the oxygen cylinder system, and Akkamma Jacob, ICU head nurse, have been
suspended pending inquiries. Meanwhile, a committee headed by three professors
of the college has been asked to conduct a detailed inquiry. into the incident.

The report will be submitted on Saturday, said Dr Pillai. "We have not
pinpointed any reason for the disruption in oxygen supply, but decided to take
action against those morally responsible. The technical assistant was on
unauthorized absence and we found there should be regular, trained hands to
monitor the supply to the ICUs and operation theatres," he said.

The government has also asked for a detailed inquiry as the hospital's nurses'
organization - the Co-operative Academy of Professional Education registered
nurses' association - had sent a complaint to the chief minister, alleging that
the three patients died in the hospital ICU last week

Hospitals, nurses need Riverpoint facility

BYLINE: Bert Caldwell The Spokesman-Review

SECTION: A; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 744 words


Dean Dorothy Detlor of the Intercollegiate School of Nursing wants to trade up
to a new Nursing Center on the Riverpoint Higher Education Campus, even if it
means leaving the quiet, pine-shadowed grounds of the Warren G. Magnuson
Building behind.

The inside of Washington's largest nursing college is as packed and noisy as the
outside is serene.

The main classroom fills to almost overflowing. Five faculty members share an
office in a converted conference room. Lights and other paraphernalia clog a
small video production studio. Technologically, the clinical laboratories are to
state-of-the-art as bone saws are to lasers.

"We really need to be on a main campus," says Detlor, who has headed the school
since 1997.

The intercollegiate center is a cooperative effort of Washington State
University, Eastern Washington University, Gonzaga University, and Whitworth
College. Students take the first two years of coursework at their home campuses
and the last two in the Magnuson building barely visible from Fort George Wright
Drive.

The school graduates about 190 students with bachelor's degrees each year, some
of them from a Yakima branch. The Legislature has added funding for another 40
students. About 60 master's degree holders graduate each year.

About two-thirds of the qualified applicants for a four-year degree are turned
away, which helps explain why Detlor and other supporters of a new center hope
to convince Washington legislators of the need for the proposed $34.6 million
Riverpoint building.

Also, an analysis released in January of the nation's health work force
estimates Washington will be short 2,700 nurses next year, and 8,800 by 2010.
The national shortage will exceed 400,000.

Those figures may be hard to accept in a community enduring layoffs at its
hospitals, but Detlor says rural hospitals and those in the Puget Sound area are
the institutions desperate for help. The Spokesman-Review Sunday employment
classifieds included listings for RN openings as far afield as Valdez, Alaska.

Detlor says quantity is just half the story. The more acutely ill patients who
need hospital care, and the technology required to treat them, demand nurses
with better technical skills and the education to understand the theory behind
them.

In a Pennsylvania study, hospitals with higher percentages of nurses with
four-year degrees had the lowest death rates, Detlor notes.

She says the licensed practical nurses who took the brunt of the layoffs at
Sacred Heart Medical Center have many of the technical skills of RNs, but little
training in theory. For the many who have been in the profession a long time,
going back to school to make up that ground probably makes less sense than
applying the skills they have in nursing homes, extended-care facilities or
clinics.

So what would a Riverpoint facility provide that the current one cannot? At
100,000 square feet, 50 percent more space for one thing, but Detlor says that
would be among the least of its positives.

Medicine will increasingly depend on coordination across a spectrum of care
providers, from nurses to pharmacists to therapists. Sometimes, coursework for
those care providers overlaps. The isolation of the Magnuson site on Fort George
Wright Drive discourages interaction and forces, for example, separate classes
in physical assessment for nursing and pharmacy students that could be combined
if students were on a single campus.

Also, Detlor says, new schools contain laboratories with computer-controlled
practice models that can simulate different medical conditions.

She says Riverpoint and the University District envisioned for the surrounding
area will also attract master's students who will go on to become family,
psychiatric or community health practitioners, and Ph.D. candidates who can
teach and conduct research in the nursing field. The school will begin offering
a Ph.D. program in June 2006.

Detlor says the Legislature's willingness to fund more student slots, and
accelerate planning for the Nursing Center, is reason for optimism that money
for construction will be forthcoming next year. But lawmakers anted up $33.8
million for the Academic Center barely begun at Riverpoint, and there will be
more competition for capital projects next year.

Supporters are also looking for federal money to help equip labs, the community
clinic, and stock the library. It's a long wish list.

If former senator Magnuson was still around, the check would be in the mail.

Former PN minister 'unaware' of faults with A&E concrete structure

LENGTH: 1368  words


Government after political, technical and commercial responsibility

Louis Galea, former health minister under the Nationalist administration

Former Nationalist health minister Louis Galea has expressed surprise at news
that the concrete structures at Mater Dei Hospital's accident and emergency
department are weak to the point that they cannot hold the weight of two planned
medical wards.



A third set of tests carried out in the UK have confirmed that concrete used on
certain pillars at the A&E was not strong enough, due to the use of material of
inferior quality.

Galea, who was responsible for the health sector when the Skanska contract was
signed in 1995, said the reports that emerged in the media were "news" to him.


The news was soon confirmed by the government and it has now announced that
temporary structures will be put in place this week to solidify the columns.

"[The reports] are news to me and there were never any problems of a similar
nature that were brought to my attention. The construction was regulated by a
contract and there are legal provisions to provide the contractors and
architects," Galea told MaltaToday.

He insisted that responsibility should be shouldered by the contractors and
architects as stipulated by the contracts.

Construction work on Mater Dei Hospital started in October 1995 and was
completed in 2007 by the Swedish firm Skanska at a cost of close to [#x20ac]600
million.

The Labour government yesterday said it would be asking for responsibility to be
shouldered, be it political, technical or commercial.

The Nationalist Party is however being very cautious in insisting that the onus
is on the technical people who took the technical decisions during the
construction of the state-of-the-art hospital.

"I think that political responsibility is about ensuring that obligations of
contractors and architects are listed in the contracts and that one also ensures
that these contractual obligations are carried out," Galea said.

Asked whether he was aware of any loopholes that may emerge in a deeper
examination of the contracts, Galea said Maltese laws on construction already
provide for responsibility to be shouldered by contractors and architects: "Such
matters are regulated by the same contracts."

He went on to add that the original design of the hospital was changed in 1996,
with the change in government. Under the Alfred Sant administration, the plans
of the original design were changed, doubling the number of hospital beds.


Contacted by MaltaToday, Edvard Lind, Skanska's head of media relations, said
the company didn't know much about the recent development, other than what was
reported in the media.

"No one has contacted us and we know far too little to conduct any
investigations of our own. Moreover, there were other parties involved and we
don't exactly know what the problems are and in which areas," Lind said.

Board of inquiry to analyse criminal, civil liabilities

The government will be setting up an external board of inquiry to establish the
facts and timeline of events.

The board will be analysing criminal and civil liabilities resulting from the
new development as well as cooperating and passing on any relevant information
to the Police. Technical experts will be appointed.

"This is part of the government's work to establish the facts of what could have
occurred in the past during the building of the Accident and Emergency section
at Mater Dei Hospital," the Ministry for Health said.

"The government will also be asking for responsibility to be shouldered, be it
political, technical or commercial."

A site survey of the Emergency Department and analysis of the whole hospital
will be carried out and discussions are already underway to appoint a foreign
company specialising in the sector.

The government said works to identify a new site are already underway as not to
lose any EU funds allocated for the construction of new wards.

"The government will continue keeping both the public and unions informed of the
situation. The security of patients and workers is of utmost priority and both
Health Minister Konrad Mizzi and parliamentary secretary Chris Fearne are
committed to take responsible decisions based on information being collected."


PN calls for parliamentary probe

The Nationalist Party has now called for a parliamentary probe, insisting that
contractors and architects had to answer to the "allegations reported in the
media and supported by the government".

In a letter signed by MPs Claudio Grech and Michael Gonzi, the PN asked chairman
and Labour MP Etienne Grech to urgently convene a meeting of the permanent
health committee within parliament to verify the veracity of the allegations.

"We do not yet know whether there are problems with the structure itself or
whether it simply cannot bear the weight of additional structures built over
it," the MPs said, adding that the accident and emergency departments were not
originally designed to sustain the pressure of additional buildings built over
them.
"This level of uncertainty can reduce the trust of the patients who require the
services of these departments and create additional stress for the hospital
workers."

Talking to MaltaToday, Grech, the health shadow minister, said the serious
allegations merited an urgent investigation by the health committee too,
especially since an average of 350 patients visit the A&E department every day.


While insisting that every individual who was in one way or another involved in
the construction of the hospital should appear before the committee, Grech said
one had to first establish the facts before turning to political responsibility.


"It first must be established whether the A&E department was built to support
additional floors or whether the structure itself is faulty. There are persons
who designed and certified the building and there are those who took the legal
responsibility of the buildings themselves.

"All facts must be established: people were paid to certify the building and now
they must appear before the committee to explain these tests."

Grech insisted that raising allegations or shedding doubts could create
discomfort among patients and workers at Mater Dei.

"Even contractors have a responsibility to shoulder and I won't reach any
conclusions based on sound bites or a story that appears in a newspaper," Grech
said when asked who should shoulder political responsibility.

"Our political responsibility is to address these allegations and we now await
for all facts to be established. But one cannot jump to conclusions without
having heard all versions."

Technical people must answer

In comments to the Times of Malta, former finance minister Tonio Fenech and
former health minister Joe Cassar gave very contrasting comments on the matter.


While Fenech said he was not completely surprised by the news, Cassar said he
was. Fenech argued that the structures were never designed to carry such loads
and Skanska had refused to build beyond two additional floors for safety
reasons. According to Fenech, it was for this reason that the helipad was not
built on the hospital's roof.

Cassar, on the other hand, said the results of the stress tests on the
department's columns surprised him since the project to construct additional
wards was rolled out on his watch.

Asked why the Nationalist administration had rolled out the project if he was
aware that the structures were never designed to carry such a load, Fenech said
technical people should be answering the questions.

"I was appointed Minister in 2005, years after the building was constructed,
particularly thesection in question which was built in 1996 when I was not even
in politics. Therefore, any questions related to the issue in discussion need to
be addressed to the technical people who took the decisions during the planning
and construction stages of the building," Fenech said.

"The PN has asked for an official enquiry and also scrutiny by the Parliamentary
Committee for Health, where we need to be sure that there is no risk for
patients and to determine the facts of what decisions were taken and by whom. I
stand by this position and look forward to see results."

IT issues fixed at Royal Preston Hospital but appointments still subject to
delays

LENGTH: 379  words


Appointments at Royal Preston Hospital will be delayed todayafter a technical
glitch with the computer system led to appointments being cancelled yesterday.

Hospital chiefs say that the issue was  fixed at around 11pm yesterday evening
but that some outpatients can still expect delays today as they work to get back
to normal.

It initially prompted fears the hospital was under a cyberattack.

But a spokesman for Lancashire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was quick to quash
the rumour saying that this was not the case and the technical problems pose no
risk to patient safety.

The spokesman confirmed that life-saving equipment in the hospital is not
affected.

They said the problems mean that the network has lost the ability to link all
its systems together.

In an official statement the Trust said: "This afternoon some of our IT systems
have been affected by a technical component which has malfunctioned.

"We have put in place our tried and tested contingency plans to minimise
disruption to ensure we can maintain services and continue to provide safe care
and treatment for our patients.

"These plans are working well and there's no risk to patient safety.

"We have postponed some outpatient clinics today and sincerely apologise to
everyone whose appointment has been affected.

"We will be in touch to reschedule these appointments as soon as possible.

"A team of IT experts are currently working on the issue and we expect the
system to be up and running within the next 24 hours."

The network began to malfunction at 3.30pm this afternoon.

IT issues fixed at Royal Preston Hospital but appointments still subject to
delays

LENGTH: 379  words


Appointments at Royal Preston Hospital will be delayed todayafter a technical
glitch with the computer system led to appointments being cancelled yesterday.

Hospital chiefs say that the issue was  fixed at around 11pm yesterday evening
but that some outpatients can still expect delays today as they work to get back
to normal.

It initially prompted fears the hospital was under a cyberattack.

But a spokesman for Lancashire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was quick to quash
the rumour saying that this was not the case and the technical problems pose no
risk to patient safety.

The spokesman confirmed that life-saving equipment in the hospital is not
affected.

They said the problems mean that the network has lost the ability to link all
its systems together.

In an official statement the Trust said: "This afternoon some of our IT systems
have been affected by a technical component which has malfunctioned.

"We have put in place our tried and tested contingency plans to minimise
disruption to ensure we can maintain services and continue to provide safe care
and treatment for our patients.

"These plans are working well and there's no risk to patient safety.

"We have postponed some outpatient clinics today and sincerely apologise to
everyone whose appointment has been affected.

"We will be in touch to reschedule these appointments as soon as possible.

"A team of IT experts are currently working on the issue and we expect the
system to be up and running within the next 24 hours."

The network began to malfunction at 3.30pm this afternoon.

Bosses at the Trust said they had no idea at this stage how many patient's
appointments have been cancelled'.

Call goes out for schools grand reunion

A REUNION is being arranged to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of a
school.

Pupils who attended Stanfield Technical High School - now Haywood High, in High
Lane, Stanfield, between 1932 and the early Seventies, are being urged to attend
a reunion in September.

The school was established in Moorland Road, Burslem, in the buildings of the
original Haywood Hospital in 1932, as the County Technical School. It became
Stanfield Technical High in 1960 and moved out of Moorland Road to new premises
at High Lane.

Re-organisation of education in the city brought further changes as the school
became comprehensive, feeding into the Sixth Form College. It was first
Stanfield High and then finally became todays Haywood High.

To mark this 70th anniversary year, old boys of the former Technical School are
organising a reunion which is to take place on the evening of September 20.

Proceeds from the event are to be donated to the present-day Haywood High
school.

David Moore, who left the school in 1965, is helping to arrange the reunion. He
said: "There has already been some inquiries from people in California and
Australia."

Further details and the GBP 8 tickets are available from: Stanfield Reunion, c/o
Mr. D. Moore, 6 Pennine Way, Biddulph, Staffs, ST8 7EJ or by e-mail
dmoore@lnw1.demon.co.uk

Cheques payable to Stanfield Tech. Reunion. Ex-students should also enclose a
stamped SAE with all correspondence.

Nurses union OKs contract with ACMH Hospital

BYLINE: Jodi Weigand, The Valley News-Dispatch, Tarentum, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 266 words


June 11--Nurses and technical professionals unions have ratified contracts with
ACMH Hospital in East Franklin.

The Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses & Allied Professionals represents
420 employees at ACMH.

The nurses contract is a one-year extension that expires in September 2017.

The technical professionals and LPN contract is for two years and expires in
March 2018, ACMH spokeswoman Anne Remaley said.

This is the first contract for the tech professionals and LPNs, who organized in
2014, according to a news release from the union.

Their contract provides a 2 percent wage increase in January. The LPNs and
technical professionals will receive a $400 ratification bonus, an increase in
the employer contribution to the retirement plan and a continuation of longevity
bonuses ranging from $300 to $2,000, based on years of service.

The registered nurses contract includes a 2.25 percent wage increase. That group
will now be permitted to use a $2,000 annual education benefit to pay for
continuing education requirements instead of just college course reimbursement.

Health care costs in both contracts remain low and include a slight deductible
increase, according to the union.

Because both contracts expire within four months of each other, the groups plan
to collaborate in bargaining for their next contract, the union release said.

Two men held after death of stabbing victim

BYLINE: Barry Roche, Southern Correspondent

SECTION: Ireland; Regional News; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 415 words


Gardai investigating the murder of a 33-year-old man, who died in Waterford
Regional Hospital early yesterday morning, have arrested two men and are
questioning them at Waterford Garda station.

Detectives believe that Simon Carton was stabbed at least six times in the back
and the neck after a row broke out with another man in his flat in Barrack
Street, Waterford city, at around 8.20 p.m. on Tuesday.

According to a Garda source, Mr Carton got into a row when one of three men
visiting his flat wanted to borrow a UB40 tape. While they were tussling over
the tape, another man picked up a knife and lunged several times at Mr Carton,
said the source.

It is thought that a third man, who was not involved in the row, ran downstairs
to a neighbouring flat to raise the alarm.

Gardai and emergency services were called.

Mr Carton, who was single and unemployed, was taken by ambulance to Waterford
Regional Hospital, Ardkeen, where he died at about 1.45 a.m yesterday. Gardai
immediately launched a murder inquiry.

Officers sealed off Mr Carton's flat and a team from the Garda Technical Bureau
in Dublin arrived yesterday afternoon to carry out a forensic examination of the
scene.

State Pathologist Prof Marie Cassidy was also called to carry out a post-mortem
to establish the exact cause of death.

Detectives immediately began a search for the men who were in the flat at the
time, and one of them, a man in his 20s, arrived into Waterford Garda station at
around 11.30 a.m. yesterday.

He was arrested under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, which allows for a
detention period of up to 12 hours.

A second man, also in his 20s, was arrested yesterday afternoon and brought to
Waterford Garda station for questioning about the killing.

Meanwhile, detectives searched the area for a murder weapon and carried out
door- to-door inquiries.

It is understood that Mr Carton, a native of Gorey, Co Wexford, had been living
in Waterford for some time. His parents still live in Gorey and yesterday were
being comforted by family and friends.

Mr Carton's killing is the second violent death in Waterford in 10 days.

Mary "Maimie" Walsh (54) from Woodale, Glendalligan, Kilrossanty was murdered on
August 30th, 2004.

Mrs Walsh's body was found locked in the boot of her blue Hyundai Coupe car in
Cathal Brugha Street on September 1st, two days after she went missing. A
58-year-old Scottish man has since been charged with her murder.

IAS officer dies without treatment

SECTION: TIMES CITY

LENGTH: 417 words


An IAS officer died without treatment on Thurs day after suf fering a heart
attack at his of fice in Kariga ri Bhavan in New Town's Action Area III. There
was no medical aid available in the office complex or in the vicinity except for
medicines stored in a kit since the beginning of this year.

Government officials failed to get hold of a doctor in New Town and took him to
a nearby cancer hospital instead. However, all attempts to resuscitate him
failed.

Prithish Chandra Sarkar, a joint secretary of technical education and training
department, was in office and held a meeting with departmental secretary Hridesh
Mohan at noon. He returned to his chambers around 1pm.Around 2pm, Sarkar was
found collapsed on the floor of his office room by a Group D staffer who took a
file to his office. The staffer raised an alarm and senior officials were
informed. Minister of technical education Ujjwal Biswas, too, was informed.

"We forced some emergency medication in his mouth before we rushed him to the
hospital," said Sufal Mondal, an employee.

Since a cancer hospital was the nearest, Sarkar was taken there. The emergency
team was ready as the hospital

was informed over the phone.However, even after repeated efforts, attempts to
resuscitate Sarkar failed.

Sarkar was cremated by his family on Friday . His wife, Shipra, who came to the
Karigari Bhavan office, said that her husband was a heart patient. "He was
averse to going to the doctor. He only took homeopathic medicines and used to
consult homeopathic books," she said.

The staff and officers held a condolence meeting on Friday in their office. They
spoke about the need of medical aid in Karigari Bhavan. They said there are
dispensaries only at Writers' Building, Nabanna and Bikash Bhavan, and most of
the government offices lack such facilities.

"We are not sure if a doctor in this office could have saved him. But we could
have been consoled thinking that at least we tried our best," said Indrajit Pal,
an employee.

This office was shifted to New Town at the end of January this year. There is no
dispensary within a square kilometer of it even though it houses over 450
people.

Biswas said, "It is unfortunate that the officer died while at office. The chief
minister was informed of his death and she conveyed her condolences to the
family . As he has a daughter studying in Class XII and a son in Class IX, the
chief minister has asked to take care of the bereaved family . We are
considering if a doctor can be posted in this office complex."

Class use of public building a surprise

BYLINE: BRYAN GILMER

SECTION: NORTH PINELLAS TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 690 words

DATELINE: TARPON SPRINGS



Mayor Frank DiDonato said he thought he was doing the right thing when he  told
school district officials they could hold vocational classes in the  former
library building at Craig Park.

But City Manager Costa Vatikiotis said the City Commission must approve the  use
of city buildings by outside groups and ensure that activities there serve  a
public purpose. And DiDonato never asked for a vote.

Vatikiotis said he did not know that classes had been scheduled for the
building until a coordinator for a nursing class called Sept. 14 to ask for a
key to get into the building for an orientation meeting that night.

Commissioner Karen Brayboy said she thought DiDonato took the project  further
by himself than the commission intended. DiDonato had mentioned to
commissioners at public meetings that he was talking with people from the
Pinellas Technical Education Center about where classes could meet.

"I believe the consensus was that he would come forward with more detail  on
what they were going to do," she said. "We were not updated on what came  out of
these meetings."

There has been disagreement over a new use for the Craig Park building  since
the public library moved into a new building on Lemon Street early last  year.

Groups that regularly use city buildings must sign agreements that cover  issues
of liability and responsibility, Vatikiotis said.

No such agreement was signed by the school district.

The item was put on the agenda for tonight's special City Commission  meeting
after Vatikiotis raised concerns. However, DiDonato said Monday the  issue would
be removed because Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital told him it would  host the
nursing class.

The hospital said earlier it had no room for the class. But hospital
administrator Joseph Kiefer said that changed when staff learned it was a  night
class, not a day class as originally thought.

DiDonato said Monday that it was frustrating that anyone would suggest he  acted
improperly.

"People tend to react instead of check into things," he said. "I'm not  stupid.
I'm going to include everybody I can include. It would have been  brought in
time to the commission."

He said he has been focusing on much larger issues, such as the vacancy  created
by Vatikiotis' recent resignation, and the date that classes were to  begin at
the center sneaked up on him.

Vatikiotis said the confusion is an example of problems that contributed to  his
decision to quit at the end of the month.

"To me, it all boils down to communication," he said. "These things can  be
easily avoided."

DiDonato, who campaigned before his election in March on a promise to bring
such vocational classes to the city, said commissioners and city officials
would do well to focus on the courses' benefits to the city.

"This is kind of the first time through it for everybody involved," he  said,
adding that snags are to be expected.

Commissioner David Archie also promised better vocational training when he
campaigned. He said the issue of whether the nursing class had permission to
use the Craig Park center sounded to him like miscommunication.

However, holding the class at Helen Ellis means that no new vocational  training
has been brought to Tarpon Springs, he said. Classes overseen by PTEC  have been
held there and at the Union Academy Cultural Center occasionally, he  said.

Archie said PTEC needs a permanent place to hold classes in the city, and  he
hopes the City Commission can give it one.

"I'm not looking as far as placing blame and pointing fingers," he said.  "If
there have been some problems, what do we have to do so that the project  can go
forward?"

Brayboy said she thought DiDonato miscalculated.

"I would suspect that after this, he is probably going to be more  sensitive in
the future, and decide - with the commission - how we would like  to go forward
with it."

The commissioners tonight will discuss whom to appoint as interim city  manager
after a city department head withdrew her candidacy last week.

The meeting begins at 6:30 p.m. in City Hall at 324 E Pine St.

Cladding to be stripped from city's top hospital

BYLINE: Kate Foster

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 429 words


SCOTLAND'S biggest hospital is to have cladding panels removed after tests
revealed they are similar to those used on the Grenfell Tower.

The move was announced last night following 'forensic checks' at the £842million
Queen Elizabeth University Hospital . Panels will be removed from three external
sections 'at the earliest possible opportunity', NHS bosses said. But they
insisted the superhospital, in Glasgow, is one of the most 'fire-safe' in the
country.

At least 80 people are believed to have died in the Grenfell Tower fire in June.
Its exterior cladding, made from an aluminium composite material (ACM), is
thought to have contributed to the blaze's rapid spread. A review of building
and fire safety is now being carried out nationwide.

The showpiece hospital, opened in 2015, has already been affected by a series of
problems, including poor cleanliness and long waiting times.

Yesterday, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'The Queen Elizabeth University
Hospital is one of the most fire-safe buildings in the country, having been
designed and engineered to meet building and fire safety regulations.

'Last month we brought in external technical advisers to give the board further
assurance on fire safety following concerns arising about external cladding as a
result of the Grenfell Tower fire.

'We have identified a type of aluminium composite material on parts of the Queen
Elizabeth University Hospital of a similar type to, but not the same as,
Grenfell.

'As a purely precautionary measure - and to make sure the public, our patients
and our staff have full confidence in the safety of the hospital - we have taken
the decision to remove the panels. We are working with contractors and technical
advisers to assess how this work can proceed.' Scottish Fire and Rescue Service
assistant chief officer David McGown said that as part of the service's 'regular
risk-based audit programme', safety assessments at the hospital were
'satisfactory'.

Health Secretary Shona Robison said: 'Patient safety is paramount and that is
why further forensic checks are taking place across the whole NHS estate in
Scotland.' The Scottish Government yesterday said a meeting of the Ministerial
Working Group on building and fire safety had taken place. It has decided to
compile a 'detailed inventory' of the design features of all high domestic
buildings to get a clear picture of possible ways to improve fire safety.

A Scottish Tory spokesman said: 'The health board is doing the right thing.
People are understandably concerned about these panels.'

'Patient safety is paramount'

NURSING PROGRAM SHOWING PROMISE

BYLINE: Linda Wilson Fuoco, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: METRO; Pg. W-1

LENGTH: 673 words


The practical nursing program at Pittsburgh Technical Institute in North Fayette
is not quite 2 years old, but it's off to a great start, achieving full approval
from the State Board of Nursing.

The first class of 12 students started the program in July 2010 and graduated 12
months later. After completing the PTI program, 100 percent of them passed the
state licensure exam the first time they took the test, which surpassed the 80
percent benchmark established by the State Board of Nursing. Passing the test
qualified them to work as licensed practical nurses.

And that wasn't their only success. All 12 landed jobs in their field.

"Any time we are talking about adding a new program, we do a feasibility study,"
said Eileen Riley, vice president of education at Pittsburgh Technical
Institute.

School officials consider whether the program meets PTI's mission, whether it
fits community and industry needs, and, she said, "will they be able to be
employed?"

The State Board of Nursing actually requires that a need exists for a program
before it approves a new one, said Lynette Jack, chairwoman of the nursing
department at PTI.

Pennsylvania will have a 32 percent shortage of licensed practical nurses by
2016, according to The Pennsylvania Center for Workforce Information and
Analysis.

Lynsi Ireson, a graduate of PTI's first licensed practical nursing class, said
she is pleased with the PTI program and loves her nursing job at a long-term
care facility for elderly patients.

"I've wanted to be a nurse since I was little," said Ms. Ireson, who graduated
from South Fayette High School in 2009.

She knew about PTI because her mother had worked there. And, she said, when she
did an Internet search for practical nursing programs, "there is not much
available locally."

The PTI training prepares students to work in a variety of places, including
hospitals, doctor's offices, nursing homes, hospice, community health agencies,
home health care service and rehabilitation centers.

Ms. Ireson said she likes working at a long-term care facility because she gets
to bond with patients who will be in there for a long time, unlike in a
hospital, where patients generally go home after a short stay.

She said PTI teachers and staff were very helpful in assisting graduates in
obtaining jobs.

Depending on the employer, a licensed practical nurse's duties include helping
with treatment plans, distributing medications, administering fluids, giving
immunizations and helping with patient education, according to PTI.

A practical nurse works under the supervision of doctors, dentists and/or
registered nurses.

The average salary for PTI graduates is $35,500, officials said.

Each practical nursing student must serve 1,086 clinical hours, which is 69
percent of the curriculum. Students put in those hours at a variety of
facilities, including gerontology work at Kane Regional Centers of Allegheny
County and obstetrical/gynecological work at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC.

Twenty percent of a student's clinical time is spent on campus because PTI is
one of the practical nursing programs in Pennsylvania that offers an on-site
simulation lab, Ms. Riley said.

The lab looks like a hospital room and contains a dummy that serves as a
"patient," which "breathes" when a student performs CPR and turns blue if a
student fails to revive it.

When most people think of technical schools, they usually think of technical
courses rather than nursing programs.

Pittsburgh Technical Institute, founded in 1946, provides "career-focused
education," according to its news release. It offers two-year degree and
certificate programs in areas including building technology, business, criminal
justice, design, health care, technology and, now, nursing.

The second practical nursing class started in July 2011, and the third class,
which started in January, includes three men.

Many students are "non-traditional," school officials said, which means they are
older than traditional college students.

Operative Experience to Deliver First Commercial Sale of World's Only
"Hands-In-The-Body" Emergency Obstetric Simulator, C-Celia

BYLINE: Operative Experience, Inc.

LENGTH: 386  words


North East, MD,  October 12, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Operative Experience, Inc., a
fast rising developer of high-fidelity human simulators for surgical and pre-
hospital education, today announced the first commercial sale of its
state-of-the-art emergency obstetrics skills simulator, C-Celia to Manatee
Technical College (MTC), a post-secondary, career and technical education center
with campuses in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch and Palmetto, Florida. C-Celia is the
world's first "hands-in-the-body," open surgery simulator designed to prepare
surgical practitioners and students for life-saving procedures such as emergency
c-section delivery, postpartum hemorrhage control, emergency hysterectomy and
fetal delivery complications.

Lisa Graham-Coonrod, MTC's Surgical Program Director, had been looking for a
simulator that could give her students the true-to-life experience of a real
operating room but until she tried C-Celia, had not been able to find anything.
"It's the most awesome thing ever! The patient bleeds, the uterus looks like a
real uterus and the baby, umbilical cord, placenta and amniotic fluid are all
incredibly accurate," said Graham-Coonrod.

Operative Experience is already expanding sales of C-Celia to obstetrics and
surgical technology teaching programs as well as nursing and military markets.
"This is a tremendous milestone for the company," said Jane O'Reilly, VP of
Global Sales for OEI. "The reaction to C-Celia throughout the marketplace has
been unbelievable and we are thrilled that Manatee Tech is already using the
simulator to help elevate the training and capabilities of their learners."

Manatee Technical College was able to purchase the C-Celia emergency obstetrics
skills simulator with the help of Perkins IV Federal Career and Technical
Education funding.

About Operative Experience, Inc.

Operative Experience, Inc. is on a mission to revolutionize surgical and pre-
hospital training. Using medical simulators with unprecedented anatomical and
surgical fidelity within a rigorous experiential instructional paradigm, OEI
reduces training costs while increasing training effectiveness and retention.
OEI is dedicated to applying this technology to reduce combat and civilian
surgical mortality, and to provide humanitarian support to developing countries
with limited medical resources.

Lab techs at jail fear for their safety: Female health workers at Wilkinson Road
often left alone with potentially dangerous inmates

BYLINE: Rob Shaw, Times Colonist

SECTION: CAPITAL & VAN. ISL.; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 559  words


Health workers who collect blood samples from inmates at the Wilkinson Road jail
say they are left unsupervised with potentially dangerous inmates and will
refuse to enter the prison unless security improves.

A technical assistant from Royal Jubilee Hospital travels once a week to the
Vancouver Island Regional Correctional Centre -- better known as the Wilkinson
Road jail -- to draw blood from inmates for medical testing.

A guard is required to be within sight of the inmate and technical assistant at
all times.

But technical assistants claim guards have frequently walked out of the room,
leaving a female lab worker alone with a male prisoner from the maximum-security
jail.

The Hospital Employees' Union, which represents the technical assistants, told
members yesterday not to enter the jail if they feel unsafe.

Sources told the Times Colonist that prison management was notified of the
concerns approximately two weeks ago when a guard left two technical assistants
alone with an inmate more than five times. Technical assistants threatened to
suspend service.

The techs have called the situation a "ticking time bomb" and fear someone will
be hurt.

"Some of the lab techs are afraid the syringes might be ripped out of their
hands and used against them. They are quite concerned for their health and
safety," said Mike Old, HEU communications director. He added that there seems
to be staffing problems among the guards.

"So if there's something going on down the hall, [the guard] will often close
the door and leave the lab tech alone with the prisoner."

The techs have the right to refuse to enter an unsafe workplace according to
Workers' Compensation Board Regulations, said Old.

Wilkinson Road jail houses inmates awaiting trial for charges that could be as
serious as murder.

It also houses prisoners convicted of crimes and some inmates who have
blood-borne diseases such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis.

Jail officials are aware of the safety complaint and are investigating, said
B.C. Corrections spokesman Bruce Bannerman. "There are protocols in place
already to address safety and those are being reviewed," he said.

Health workers who already work in the jail could provide services if the
technical assistants refuse to enter the building, said Bannerman.

Eight technical assistants rotate weekly through blood collection shifts at
VIRCC. They are employed by the Vancouver Island Health Authority, which also
services William Head Institution.

"We take the security and safety of our staff really seriously," said VIHA
spokeswoman Suzanne Germain. "Following the incident a couple of weeks ago, VIHA
withdrew the collection services for one week to allow an internal review."

Since then, discussions between VIHA and B.C. Corrections have been ongoing, she
said. The two sides plan to meet before the end of the month.

Bannerman would not comment on the HEU allegation that staffing shortages was
creating the problem.

When a guard was allegedly assaulted by an inmate earlier this month at the
Wilkinson Road jail, the guards' union went public with complaints the facility
is overcrowded.

The prisoner-to-guard ratio has risen to as high as 40:1 in some cases, when it
used to be half that amount, the guards' union said.

Those concerns have been echoed at other B.C. correction centres, which are
running at 100 per cent capacity throughout the province.

Bio-med equipment engineering diploma course launched

BYLINE: HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE

LENGTH: 425  words


KATHMANDU: Biomedical Equipment Training Centre (BMET), Teku, under the Ministry
of Health and Population, in association with National Health Training Centre
and Nick Simons Institute formally launched a diploma in biomedical equipment
engineering course today.

BMET had been providing a 12-month biomedical equipment technician course since
2013. It will now provide a more advanced 18-month diploma course in bio-medical
equipment engineering.

At the inauguration programme, Minister for Health and Population Khagaraj
Adhikari said diploma course in biomedical equipment engineering would enhance
the expertise of human resources for managing medical equipment in hospitals
throughout the country.

"Lack of biomedical technicians in hospitals and medical institutions is one of
the reasons behind insufficient scientific medical diagnosis of various
diseases," he said.

Due to shortage of biomedical equipment engineers in the country, the health
sector has had to incur huge costs while hiring foreign experts and engineers to
fix dysfunctional medical equipment.

Referring to a defunct CT scan machine at Bir Hospital, Adhikari said, "The
government has spent Rs 14 crore on the machine. It will be far cheaper to
repair it than to make a huge investment on a new machine."

The diploma course in biomedical equipment engineering run by BMET is affiliated
to the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT). Higher
secondary graduates from science stream are eligible to enroll in the course. As
many as 24 students have been selected for diploma in biomedical equipment
engineering for the academic session 2015-16. Of them, seven are female
students. The 24 students were selected out of 70 students who had appeared in
the entrance test held by CTEVT.

Gopal Khanal, vice-chairman of CTEVT said, "The students enrolled in the diploma
course in biomedical technical engineering will be experts in dealing with
medical equipment in hospitals after completing the course." Biomedical
engineers, equipment technicians and equipment assistants will be produced
through the 18-month course and they will be outsourced to various hospitals to
maintain and repair medical equipment.

Mark Zimmerman, executive officer, NSI, said the government should announce
permanent positions for bio-medical engineers so as to employ medical equipment
technicians in all hospitals. This will make the health sector efficient. He
stated that NSI would provide technical and financial support to BMET to produce
experts in management of medical equipment.

Myers retires from S. Ga. Technical College

BYLINE: Americus Times-Recorder, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

Sept. 03--AMERICUS -- South Georgia Technical College (SGTC) President Sparky
Reeves presented Carolyn S. Myers with a plaque recognizing the veteran medical
assisting instructor for 10 years of service to the college at a special
retirement reception in the John M. Pope Industrial Technology Center recently.
Myers is retiring from full-time teaching.

Myers, who is also a registered nurse, taught at Georgia Southwestern State
University (GSW) as an assistant professor of nursing from 1976 until 1984. She
also worked as a clinical instructor at GSW part-time from 1985 to1997,
supervising students in the clinical labs at Magnolia Manor Nursing Center and
Sumter Regional Hospital.

"First of all, I would like to thank you and recognize you for your dedicated
service to South Georgia Technical College," said Reeves. "We appreciate you and
wish you the best," said Reeves as he presented Myers with a plaque and a small
gift on behalf of the college and the SGTC Retirement Committee.

Myers received her bachelor of science and  master's of science in nursing in
1973 and 1975, from the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. She worked at
Eugene Talmadge Memorial Hospital in Augusta for two years as staff nurse for
the Coronary Care Unit and Medical Intensive Care Unit. She moved to Americus
and worked as the supervisor of the CCU and Surgical ICU unit at Sumter Regional
Hospital for a year before accepting a teaching position at Georgia
Southwestern.

She taught there for eight years full-time and served on numerous committees.
She also worked as a clinical instructor part-time for 12 years. After her
career at GSW, Myers served as a R.N. Certified Red Cross instructor for the
Sumter County Unit of the American Red Cross office.

In February 2002, Myers returned to teaching full-time at SGTC. She served as a
medical assisting instructor for 10 years and during her tenure at SGTC, she and
her colleagues trained over 2,650 students. She was the program chair of her
department and also served as the advisor for the college's National Technical
Honor Society for a number of years.

"We will definitely miss Carolyn Myers in the medical assisting department,"
said Dianna Skipper, a fellow instructor. "She made all the difference. She
brought a level of professionalism and expertise that will be hard to replace.
I know I am going to miss her."

Myers thanked Reeves, the members of the retirement committee and her fellow
faculty and staff members.

"I really appreciate this and I know that I am going to miss you. You have been
an important part of my life for the past 10 years and I wish all of you the
best," said Myers.

Carolyn Myers is married to Dr. Cecil Myers of Americus and the couple has three
grown children, Trey, Michael and Meredith.

Coach Ganaru Improves As Maikaba, Baleria Leave Hospital

BYLINE: David Ngobua

LENGTH: 268 words


The high degree of anxiety that enveloped the management and players of Kano
Pillars on Thursday when the team's acting Technical adviser, Coach Mohammed
Baba Ganaru and his assistants were rushed to hospital after a ghastly auto
accident has subsided as they are said to be in very stable conditions.

It will be recalled that the official car that was conveying members of the
Pillars technical crew from Ilorin to Kano had a burst tyre at Gangarida in
Ikara Local government Area of Kano State resulting to the fatal accident that
claimed the life of a road side vulcanizer.

The injured coaches,Baba Ganaru, Abdullahi Maikaba and Umar Baleria were rushed
to kwnar Dangora clinic from where they were later transferred to Murtala
Hospital for treatment.

Even though Maikaba and Baleria were discharged yesterday, the technical adviser
who suffered serious head injuries is still in hospital but the team's Media
Officer, Malam Idris Malikawa told Weekly Trust yesterday that his (Ganaru)
condition has improved.

He said the life of the tactician is no more in danger but he needs to stay back
in the hospital for more treatment and observation.

"I want to confirm that the condition of our coaches has improved tremendously.
All of them are now in a stable condition. Maikaba and Baleria have been
discharged but Ganaru who suffered more serious injuries on his head is still in
hospital.

"However, there is no more danger. I was with him not long ago and he went to
the toilet all by himself and when he came back, he sat up and we discussed for
a long time. All he needs now is enough rest and sleep", said Malikawa

Pending bills delay repair of MRI machine at GMCH

SECTION: AURANGABAD

LENGTH: 335 words


AURANGABAD: The defunct MRI awaiting repair since the past one month at the
Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has left poor patients in the
lurch. The non-functional MRI machine used to make major radiological
investigations has taken the waiting list of patients to more than 200.
According to the hospital authorities, the machine became defunct as one of its
parts developed a technical snag and the company concerned has been asked to
carry out the repair work.In absence of the MRI machine, poor patients are left
with no option than to turn to private hospitals or private centres. GMCH
officials said they are making efforts to get the machine repaired at the
earliest.However, highly placed sources in the GMCH said, "The concerned company
with which the GMCH has signed a comprehensive maintenance contract has refused
to resolve the technical fault of the machine over pending bills."Sources said
the bills amounting to Rs 72 lakh have been pending with the hospital since the
past two years."It is an indication of the dismal state of diagnostic facilities
in government hospitals in the state.

This is the only government hospital in the city which provides MRI facility.
Poor patients have to wait for their turn for four months to get diagnosed,"
said a patient, who had come all the way from Sillod, 80km from here. He was
suffering from orthopaedic problem.He said nearly 15 patients who were given
appointment on Saturday at the GMCH were sent back citing that it will take time
to repair the defunct machine.Suhas Jewlikar, medical superintendent at the
GMCH, said, "There is some technical fault in one of the parts of the MRI
machine resulting in its failure. The company concerned has been told to repair
it. The machine will start functioning soon.""Around 15-16 patients go for MRI
every day. They are definitely suffering for the last one month. We hope that
the machine is repaired soon and put to use for the welfare of patients," he
added.

IAS officer dies without treatment

SECTION: KOLKATA

LENGTH: 424 words


KOLKATA: An IAS officer died without treatment on Thursday after suffering a
heart attack at his office in Karigari Bhavan in New Town's Action Area III.
There was no medical aid available in the office complex or in the vicinity
except for medicines stored in a kit since the beginning of this year.

Government officials failed to get hold of a doctor in New Town and took him to
a nearby cancer hospital instead. However, all attempts to resuscitate him
failed.

Prithish Chandra Sarkar, a joint secretary of technical education and training
department, was in office and held a meeting with departmental secretary Hridesh
Mohan at noon. He returned to his chambers around 1pm. Around 2pm, Sarkar was
found collapsed on the floor of his office room by a Group D staffer who took a
file to his office. The staffer raised an alarm and senior officials were
informed. Minister of technical education Ujjwal Biswas, too, was informed.

"We forced some emergency medication in his mouth before we rushed him to the
hospital," said Sufal Mondal, an employee.

Since a cancer hospital was the nearest, Sarkar was taken there. The emergency
team was ready as the hospital was informed over the phone. However, even after
repeated efforts, attempts to resuscitate Sarkar failed.

Sarkar was cremated by his family on Friday. His wife, Shipra, who came to the
Karigari Bhavan office, said that her husband was a heart patient. "He was
averse to going to the doctor. He only took homeopathic medicines and used to
consult homeopathic books," she said.

The staff and officers held a condolence meeting on Friday in their office. They
spoke about the need of medical aid in Karigari Bhavan. They said there are
dispensaries only at Writers' Building, Nabanna and Bikash Bhavan, and most of
the government offices lack such facilities.

"We are not sure if a doctor in this office could have saved him. But we could
have been consoled thinking that at least we tried our best," said Indrajit Pal,
an employee.

This office was shifted to New Town at the end of January this year. There is no
dispensary within a square kilometer of it even though it houses over 450
people.

Biswas said, "It is unfortunate that the officer died while at office. The chief
minister was informed of his death and she conveyed her condolences to the
family. As he has a daughter studying in Class XII and a son in Class IX, the
chief minister has asked to take care of the bereaved family. We are considering
if a doctor can be posted in this office complex."

Gynecologists' plan to charge for laser surgery investigated

BYLINE: By Paul Watson Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 572 words


   Health Minister Elinor Caplan has ordered an investigation into a plan by
five gynecologists to charge patients $75 above the OHIP rate for laser surgery
in a private clinic.

Caplan is concerned that the doctors in Cambridge, Ont., will break the ban on
extra-billing if they go ahead as planned early next year, a spokesman for the
minister told The Star yesterday .

"The minister is aware of the situation and she's reviewing it to see how it can
be discouraged," the aide said.

Caplan is afraid Ontario will end up with a "two-tiered" health care system that
gives special treatment to people who can afford to pay more than the Ontario
Health Insurance Plan covers, her spokesman said.

But she's also worried the free trade deal with the United States will invite
American companies to set up "surgi-centres" that might skirt the ban on
extra-billing by charging for the use of high-tech equipment, he added.

Cost of later

The Cambridge doctors plan to collect their standard operating fee from OHIP,
said Dr. Miln Harvey, one of the walk-in clinic's gynecologists.

But they need the extra $75 from each patient to cover the cost and maintenance
of the carbon dioxide laser, he said.

The local Cambridge Memorial Hospital "is already running a $1.5 million deficit
and they're not terribly keen to cough up another $50,000" to buy the new laser
equipment, he said.

So women who want surgery for cervical lesions, a pre-malignant condition, now
have to join the waiting line that lasts six weeks or more at hospitals in
Kitchener, Toronto or elsewhere, Harvey said.

"You argue about the cost for people who can't afford it," he said. "Well if you
have to take a day off work to go to London for treatment, what does that cost
you?"

The doctors may decide not to buy the laser if the local hospital gets one,
Harvey said.

Technical costs

Doctors who use the laser equipment in a provincially funded hospital could not
charge patients an extra fee for it, said Peter Fraser, executive director of
the Ontario Medical Association.

Fraser said he believes doctors in privately owned clinics won't violate the ban
on extra billing if they charge for technical costs that aren't covered by OHIP.

But he admitted the Cambridge doctors are "on somewhat uncharted ground" and the
courts may decide they can't charge for the technical part of a service that is
clearly covered by OHIP.

Tax dollars pay for equipment, supplies and support staff in hospitals, so it's
logical to argue that doctors in private clinics should be allowed "to charge a
technical fee that clearly isn't covered in the procedural (OHIP) fee itself."

But the health ministry "is on record as saying there cannot be economic
barriers to (OHIP) insured services," ministry spokesman Rick Winston said.

'Cause for concern'

The province's health service appeal board is expected to rule soon on a similar
extra-billing dispute, added Dr. David Cow, the ministry's chief of medical
claims policy.

Harvey conceded the five doctors hope to make a profit on the laser, but said
"we are in this primarily to provide a service.

"We can't afford to provide this service for nothing because it's going to cost
us a lot to put up the facility," he said. "We expect to cover those costs by
recovering the money from the people who use it."

The doctors plan to start taking "walk-in" patients on Jan. 4.

Protest held, Khyber Road blocked for hours

Technical and non Technical staff of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blocked the Khyber Road
for five hours in a protest against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday
and demanding up-gradation of their services like other official crew in
province.

A large number of protestors staged a demonstration at Soori Pul area on Khyber
Road. They chanted slogans against KP government while they holding placards and
banners in their hands were also full of anti-government writings. All the
personal and commuter's vehicles were stopped to travel and only pedestrians and
patients were permitted to move.

President KP of all technical and non-technical staff led the protest and
protestors kept stones at the middle of Khyber Road. He also addressed the
participants on the occasion and used harsh words against the KP led coalition
government. He said the KP government did not announce their up-gradation in the
current fiscal year of 2014, 14 and they have been deprived of their basic
rights since long.

Technical and non-technical staff of Lady Reading Hospital, Hayatabad Medical
Complex, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Mardan Complex, Abotabad Complex, University
of Peshawar, Agriculture, Engineering University of Peshawar, Islamia College
Peshawar University and other departments participated in protest.

Speakers also informed that KP government had planned to expel daily wagers,
working in various departments in Peshawar, from their services and it was not a
justice with poor employees.

One of the electricians, Dooran Shah, while talking to The Frontier Post said
that he had joined the duty prior to 16 years in six grade but still in 2014 he
performs his duty in six rank. He asked they should be up-graded like other
department's staff and saying it was their basic right. About the KP, he said it
had come into power with the manifesto of change and justice but it had also
resorted injustice and brutality.

Later on the demonstration was called off and protestors opened the Khyber Road
and left the area.

LENGTH: 277 words


WINTER HAVEN -- United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1625, which has
been handing out leaflets to Winter Haven Hospital employees, is having an
informational meeting today to measure their interest in having the union
represent them.

Presentations will be made at 7:30 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. at the
Holiday Inn in Winter Haven, said Ed Chambers, president of the statewide local.

Union staffers and supporters will be there throughout the day to answer
questions.

The meeting is targeted to registered nurses; licensed practical nurses and
other technical employees, such as technicians and technologists; and to service
and maintenance employees.

"We've gotten lots of calls," he said. "But you need the cards before you can go
to the labor board."

Before requesting an election, the union would want signatures expressing
interest in representation from 50 percent of any group, such as registered
nurses, it would seek to represent.

UFCW Local 1625 represents registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and
other technical employees at Lakeland Regional Medical Center. Registered nurses
at Lakeland Regional voted in 1997 to have the union represent them. Technical
employees voted for representation in 2000.

The union represents support staff at Brandwyne Health Care Center and at Winter
Haven Health and Rehabilitation. Its membership also includes registered nurses
at Brandon Regional Hospital and at Kindred (formerly Vencor) in Tampa, some
phosphate-chemical workers and some Disney World employees, Chambers said.

Nursing that ambition

                                 August 5, 2000

Cheong Suk-Wai


NURSING AWARDS

Courage, discipline and dedication are still the qualities that drive today's
Florence Nightingales

NURSES' DAY here came into its own this year with the inaugural President's
Award for excellence in nursing.

More than 350 dedicated nurses with outstanding service records were nominated
for the new accolade, but the Ministry Of Health shortlisted only seven for the
final round.

At the end of all that, three women -- Ms Catherine Chua of Woodbridge Hospital,
Ms Cher Sok Kew of KK Women's & Children's Hospital and Ms Tan Wee King of the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE) -- were saluted for their exemplary
contributions to health care in Singapore, and then feted at the Istana at an
awards ceremony on Tuesday, graced by President S. R. Nathan.

In separate interviews with Life! on Wednesday and Thursday, the three nurses
cited their supportive families as being instrumental in enabling them to pursue
their calling.

For theirs is a battle fraught mostly with emotional lows, waged daily as it is
with such non-negotiables as pain and disease.

Their only weapon? Courage of a quieter, deeper kind, the sort, says Ms Chua,
52, that steels latter-day Florence Nightingales to accept that a now-empty bed,
which had just recently been allocated, may mean that the patient has either
been discharged or deceased.

Ms Tan, 45, who teaches the National Certificate of Nursing course at ITE Bishan
says: "It is generally recognised that the rigorous discipline expected in
nursing is second only to that in the military."

The drop-out rate for the course she teaches used to be 50 per cent, she says.
But since the school of nursing moved from Outram Road to ITE in January this
year, more students have signed up to do nursing as an alternative course
subject.

The larger available pool of applicants, says Ms Tan, means that she is able to
select only those whom she thinks can make the final grade.

Thus far, the school's January 2000 student intake stood at 68 (dwindling later
to 62) and the July 2000 intake is holding firm.

Says Ms Tan: "We are so short of nurses in Singapore that the opening of many
new hospital wards is being held back till they recruit suitably-trained
nurses."

She adds: "Health-care planners should rope experienced nurses into their

ANGRY TOMMY BLASTS HEALTH UNION BOSS

BYLINE: Ron Moore Chief Reporter

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 149 words

HIGHLIGHT: SUPPORT: MSP Sheridan


TOMMY Sheridan MSP has attacked health union bosses for not backing striking
hospital workers.

Mr Sheridan, Scottish Socialist member for Glasgow, met Unison staff and Fire
Brigades Union members.

Full-time NHS clerical and ancillary staff earn pounds 11,000-a-year after 15
years, while firefighters earn a maximum of pounds 21,300 after five years'
training.

The MSP tabled a motion calling on the Scottish Parliament to listen to their
pay claims.

He then blasted Unison boss Matt Smith saying: "Your lowest paid members have
been on unofficial strike without pay for two weeks and are deserving of your
support."

Last night NHS technical support staff were considering industrial action in
five Glasgow hospitals over a bid to push hourly pay from pounds 4.84 to pounds
6.02.

Staff at Vale of Leven Hospital, Alexandria, want bosses to solve a staff
shortage.

NSS nurturing 500 student entrepreneurs in the state

LENGTH: 492 words

DATELINE: THIRUVANANTHAPURAM


THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, June 22 -- The Technical Cell of the National Service Scheme
(NSS) has started nurturing student entrepreneurs from engineering colleges and
polytechnics in the state, a move that has the potential to create 5,000
employment opportunities within a year.

In the initial phase, preliminary training was given to 500 students under the
NSS Entrepreneurship Training (NET) programme. Around 300 students have already
started preparations to execute their entrepreneurial projects.

NSS State programme coordinator Abdul Jabbar Ahammed told 'Express' that by the
end of

this financial year, around 500 successful entrepreneurs will be created in the
state. The enrolled students are given training in entrepreneurial motivation,
counselling, project identification, project preparation and technical aspects.

"These students are guided to procure financial and technical aids for their
ventures. This initiative will help tap their hidden potential and make them
self sufficient," Jabbar Ahammed said.

The NSS is now focusing on curriculum-based activities with the support of those
who have completed the studies. The Social Engineers of NSS Alumni, a majority
of them entrepreneurs, will share their experience and guide the students on how
to become a successful entrepreneur.

As part of the energy conservation efforts of NSS, 'Urja Kendras' will be opened
at 100 selected engineering colleges and polytechnics in the State by August
this year. These centres, which functions from 4 pm to 5 pm on all working days,
will clear the doubts of the consumers as well as create awareness on energy
conservation.

According to Jabbar Ahammed, the social engineers of NSS will undertake the
repair works of three hospitals in each district. Hospital beds, chairs and
other equipments which needs repairs are usually abandoned due to lack of
manpower.

"Students with technical orientations will repair the hospital equipments to be
used by the patients. The Youth Welfare Board Club will regularly monitor the
hospital equipments and repair works will be undertaken based on their reports,"
said Jabbar Ahammed.

NSS which completed the energy audit of government offices found that the
majority of the offices are using incandescent lamps, ballast tube lights,
ceiling fans and ordinary coil type electrical heaters which consume more power.

In the initial phase, the NSS volunteers will utilise the CFL lamps available
with KSEB to replace the incandescent ones.

The service provided by the NSS volunteers is part of their bid to gain field
experience in the specific branches they are studying. There are also plans to
install 10,000 solar panels in buildings with the support of Anert.

There are around 152 NSS units in the State with 15,200 volunteers.

Upper Cape Tech students help build own school

BYLINE: C. Ryan Barber, Cape Cod Times, Hyannis, Mass.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 646 words


Nov. 28--BOURNE -- As early as 2004, Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical School
officials could see that the need for nurses was growing.

But belts were tightening. And the Massachusetts School Building Authority's
policy prohibited reimbursements for post-secondary education projects, putting
the technical school's plans to construct a nursing building on hold for lack of
funding.

That is, until the officials realized its high school students could lend a hand
in constructing the nursing building on the hilltop campus overlooking the Cape
Cod Canal.

Earlier this month, Upper Cape Tech cut the ribbon on its Nursing and Allied
Health Education Center, a two-year project that gave its younger students a
real-world lesson in carpentry, electricity, landscaping, information technology
networking and plumbing. The total cost: $1.3 million -- about a third of the
estimated $3.5 million cost if the school had contracted all the labor.

"This is the largest student-built project in the commonwealth," Superintendent
Robert Dutch said on a recent Thursday morning, as he walked past classrooms of
students training to become licensed practical nurses.

The 10,000-square-foot center features classroom and lab space, replete with
hospital beds, monitoring equipment and fake patients.

One mannequin, known as "SimMan," responds to mock injections and can be
programmed to suffer from kidney stones or a heart attack, among a host of other
ailments.

Judith Pelletier, the director of Upper Cape Tech's practical nursing program,
said the SimMan allows the school to expose post-secondary students to
situations that they might not otherwise encounter in a clinical setting.

Students -- who must have a GED or high school diploma to be accepted into the
program -- split their time between the classroom and health clinics. The
program prepares them for careers in rehabilitation and long-term care, among a
variety of other health care settings, but it also can be a stepping stone into
programs to become a registered nurse.

The building will accommodate 60 full-time students in the 10-month day program.
In January, 20 students will begin an 18-month part-time program, Dutch said.

David Augustinho, executive director of the Cape and Islands Workforce
Investment Board, said the need for LPNs is especially acute at long-term care
facilities. The part-time program will enable Cape health care workers to grow
their careers, he said.

"It's easier for someone with a certified nursing assistance certificate to go
back to school," said Augustinho, who advises the technical school about labor
trends. "It's much easier to do on a part-time basis than a full-time basis."

Pam Almada, director of professional development at Jordan Hospital, said the
need for nurses only will continue as baby boomers retire and, eventually,
require medical assistance.

Staff from the Plymouth hospital serve on Upper Cape Tech's nursing advisory
board, and Almada said the technical school's students are looked to whenever
the hospital wants to hire licensed practical nurses.

"They're organized, they hold their students accountable and responsible, and
they don't seem to bring issues into the building," Almada said. "It's just an
overall well-run program."

Upper Cape Tech used to have its nursing program within the same core building
where high school-age students attend class.

But, with that building already overcrowded, it leased classrooms at Cape Cod
Regional Technical High School in Harwich.

With the Nursing and Allied Health Education Center, Dutch said Upper Cape Tech
can now bring all 60 students under the same roof and into a more professional
setting.

"This gives them that sense that they're not in high school anymore," Dutch
said.

PLYMOUTH JUNIOR TECHNICAL SCHOOL THE Junior Tech was established around a small
group of students based in the old Plymouth Technical College in 1911.

Three years later, having met the necessary criteria the school was officially
constituted as the Plymouth Junior Technical School.

As such it soon outgrew the accommodation available for it in the Tech and, in
1921, the school was relocated to the former Durnford Hotel at Stonehouse.

During World War One this building had served as a hospital for army officers,
and now the former billiard room became the carpentry shop and the old kitchen,
the metalwork shop.

Intended as a temporary arrangement the school remained in Durnford Street until
1938, when, with three other local boys' schools it was moved to the former
Stoke Military Hospital (home now of Devonport High School for Boys). However
the outbreak of war once more saw the schools scatter and the Junior Tech moved
to Cobourg Street, then the somewhat inadequate former Mount Street Board
School, where, without adjacent playing fields or facilities, it stayed until
1959 when the purpose built Widey Technical School was opened at Crownhill.

Mural has lofty goal: `Take the Stairs'

BYLINE: Susan Spencer

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 435 words

DATELINE: MILFORD


MILFORD - Employees, visitors and patients at Milford Regional Medical Center
now have more reason to take the stairs instead of the elevator.

Besides the cardiovascular and weight control benefits of walking up a flight or
two, stair climbers can explore a mural created by painting and design students
from Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School. The students
worked with some 50 hospital employees and the medical center's Healthy Balance
Committee.

The mural, "Take the Stairs," evolved over several months under the guidance of
Boston-area "community muralist" Tova Speter, 34, who uses art as a way to bring
diverse groups together to create change. It was dedicated at a ceremony
Tuesday.

The mural features health-and-wellness-inspired images, including a runner whom
hospital CEO Francis M. Saba painted adorned with a "Boston Strong" shirt, and
marathoner and triathlete Dick Hoyt, who pushes his son, Rick Hoyt, in a
wheelchair during races.

The Hoyts are members of the Hockomock Area YMCA, which was one of the mural's
sponsors. Other sponsors include Stop & Shop, a hospital employee fund, and
Benjamin Moore, which donated paint.

"Things were local and meaningful," said Ellen Freedman, community benefits
manager at Milford Regional.

Ms. Freedman said staff members from across the hospital worked with

students on the painting. Medical interpreters, for instance, added encouraging
messages in Spanish and Portuguese guiding people to the stairwell, which is
across from the cafeteria near the main entrance.

"Everyone found it incredibly rewarding," Ms. Freedman said. "It was different
from what they do each day."

Ms. Speter said, "It was great as an artist to see the interaction between the
students and the employees. My whole goal is to bring out the talents that
people have within them that they might not know they have."

The details in the design draw people back to look at it again and again, Ms.
Speter said.

"We tried to incorporate different subtleties in the design so there's always
something new to discover," she said. "The impact of the project will hopefully
inspire people at the hospital to take the stairs."

Samples of Ms. Speter's work can be seen at www.tovaspeter.com.

Odisha hospital head shunted after probe finds administrative lapse in infant
deaths

BYLINE: Ashok Pradhan

SECTION: BHUBANESWAR

LENGTH: 248 words


BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha government on Tuesday shunted superintendent of Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Paediatrics (Sishu Bhawan) in
Cuttack, Niranjan Mohanty, after a technical committee blamed administrative
lapse behind the spurt in infant deaths in the premier paediatric hospital in
past three weeks.

Acting on probe report of the technical committee led by Director medical
education and training Prakash Mohapatra submitted to the government on Monday,
the health department transferred him to MKCG Medical College and Hospital,
Berhampur. Dr Saroj Satpathy was appointed the new superintendent.

Health secretary Arti Ahuja said the technical panel found "administrative
shortcomings" in patient care. There was no "clinical negligence" she said.

Quoting the DMET report, Ahuja said the hospital did not follow a "roaster
chart" for emergency duty and was found lax in its practice for the intensive
care unit (ICU), she said.

Ahuja said the hospital witnessed a sudden jump in patient inflow this year
compared of previous years. Over 80per cent patients had travelled over 50 km to
reach the hospital in critical condition.

The government had constituted the panel on August 25 after 24 infants died in
four days creating uproar in the state assembly.

On September 1, the state government suspended six employees of the institute
and lodged FIRs against three of them and announced an Rs 10 crore upgradation
plan for the hospital.

HARTFORD - Business ties between members of a state health care steering
committee and contractors vying for grants through a $45 million reform effort
have triggered criticism from legislators and consumer advocates over what they
see as unchecked conflicts of interest.

The panel has an ethics standard that differs from other public agencies, in
part because its members are appointed by the lieutenant governor, not the
governor. Its members do not have to disclose relationships with vendors -
except for when they participate with state officials in awarding contracts. At
that point, they have to sign the stricter ethics statement that applies to
public officials and state employees.

Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman's office said the steering committee actually adheres to a
standard that is greater than what the federal government requires - but critics
say the conflicts compromise the reform effort.

Two steering committee members, one of them the president of Griffin Hospital,
have links to vendors sharing a nearly $600,000 technical assistance contract.
Two other board members, both doctors, worked for two of the first four medical
practices chosen to receive the free, highly valued technical assistance. The
vendors will help medical groups across the state become "person-centered
practices," with comprehensive health and psychological screenings of the
patients and a greater emphasis on outcomes of treatment.

The health care innovation steering committee is driving the effort to improve
medical care and enable doctors to eventually share in the insurance savings
that comes from healthier patients. State officials say that the panelists are
"insulated" from the actual awarding of contracts. They use the terms "firewall"
and "information blackout" when describing the separation between the panel's
duty to make recommendations, and the granting of money from the $45 million
federal fund.

However, steering committee members can and do participate, along with state
officials, in the review and selection of contractors.

When the members do participate, the officials stress, they must at that point
sign the stricter ethics disclosure statement that applies to the rest of state
government.

Victoria Veltri, Wyman's health care policy adviser, and Mark Schaefer, the
manager of the health reform project, are steadfast that the higher ethics
threshold should not apply to the health care committee, in part because the
role of the panel is to advise and recommend, not to make binding policy
decisions.

The members' expertise and real world connections are essential to success of
the reform effort, and requiring the state's regular prohibition against
potential conflicts of interest would likely chill their willingness to
participate, Veltri and Schaefer said.

"You'd have to borrow [prospective committee members] from Massachusetts," said
Veltri. She said that the $45 million effort, known as the state innovation
model, "is by design, meant to include all these stakeholders."

Critics say there are plenty of experts who could participate without conflicts.
And they say that the panel members regularly make detailed recommendations that
form the basis of the requests for proposals, known as RFPs, that go out to the
prospective vendors.

In the first wave of grants, two companies with ties to panel members received
funds.

Patrick Charmel, the president of Griffin Hospital's parent company, is an
advisory committee member and also the president of Planetree, a sister company
of Griffin Hospital in Derby.

Planetree, which teaches medical organizations about patient-centered care, is a
subcontractor, sharing a $586,000 technical assistance contract awarded to a
company called Qualidigm, based in Wethersfield. The contract was one of the
first awarded through the federally funded reform effort.

The treasurer of Qualidigm's board of directors, Frances Padilla, also sits on
the steering committee that is helping to shape the reform effort. The Qualidigm
position is unpaid. Padilla is executive director of the Universal Health Care
Foundation of Connecticut, in Meriden.

Charmel and Padilla said in interviews that they played no role in the drafting
of the requests for proposals or the awarding of any contracts. Padilla said she
had no idea Qualidigm got the award until it came up in a subsequent committee
meeting. She said she joined other panel members in disagreeing with an aspect
of Qualidigm's approach and put her comments in writing.

Said Charmel: "I was completely insulated - obviously that's intentional. We
encourage participation, we motivate - but we have no influence on the RFPs."

Padilla said for the reform effort to take hold, "you need the stakeholders, the
doctors and the hospitals, to be at the table.

"I understand the concerns about conflicts - health care is an industry - but I
don't feel conflicted. Everything is in the public domain," said Padilla.

Dr. Robert McLean, an internist and specialist in rheumatology, is a steering
committee panelist and a member of Northeast Medical Group - one of the first
practices chosen to receive the technical assistance from Qualidigm and
Planetree. Northeast Medical is affiliated with Yale-New Haven Hospital.

"At the steering-committee level, we set out the criteria and what we want the
program to look like - but we don't decide who gets chosen," McLean said. "The
question is: Are the committee members getting preferential treatment or not? We
are not."

Dr. Thomas Raskauskas served on the steering committee and participated in the
debates that helped to shape the criteria for medical practices to qualify for
technical assistance. He was president and CEO of St. Vincent's Health Partners
when that practice was chosen along with Northeast Medical Group and two other
groups as the first to receive the technical assistance in July 2015. Raskauskas
left the steering committee later in the year and is no longer at St. Vincent's.

He said he could no longer comment on his service on the steering committee.

"You couldn't get away with this in any other area of state government," said
Ellen Andrews, an independent consumer advocate and a member of a subgroup of
the health care steering committee. "It's created a 'good old boy network' for
health care reform. You have your insiders and you have your outsiders.''

State Sen. Leonard Fasano, a Republican of North Haven, said the innovation
project, seeking to reform a $30 billion system affecting nearly all of
Connecticut, "is operating largely in the shadows of the halls of government."

Andrews, Fasano and others blame the loophole involving the Wyman appointees in
state ethics law. Members of committees who are appointed by the governor are
considered public officials - and must comply with stricter disclosure rules on
potential conflicts of interest.

A bill that would have closed this loophole died in the legislature in June.

More time to have your say on Calderdale and Huddersfield A&E plans

LENGTH: 226  words


People have more time to have their say on controversial changes to hospital
services in Calderdale and Huddersfield after a glitch with an online survey.

The survey, which asks people's views on plans to centralise A&E care at
Calderdale Royal Hospital, can now be completed up until 5pm on Friday.

The deadline was midnight last night but has been extended after a technical
problem meant answers could not be given after 11pm yesterday.

Huddersfield will have its an A&E downgraded to an urgent care centre treating
minor ailments if the proposals go ahead.

The town's existing infirmary would be replaced with a smaller hospital designed
for planned NHS treatments.

Up to 300 beds would be added to Calderdale Royal Hospital, which would become
the main A&E for the two districts under plans by Calderdale and Greater
Huddersfield Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).

The CCGs said in a statement: "A technical issue occurred between 11pm and
midnight on Tuesday, 21st June, which meant that some people were unable to
submit their survey online during this timeframe.

"The technical issue has now been resolved, and we have extended the opportunity
for people to complete their survey on-line until 5pm on Friday, June 24.

"We apologise for the inconvenience, and encourage people to complete the survey
online."

Privatization would help nurses make more money

BYLINE: Michael Campbell

SOURCE: Vancouver Sun

SECTION: BUSINESS, Pg. F1 / Front Michael Campbell

LENGTH: 579 words


Our attitudes about monopolies are inconsistent, to say the least.

On the one hand, very few of us who get cable TV, insure our cars through ICBC,
or have enjoyed Air Canada lately would argue that monopolies are the most
cost-effective, innovative and customer-sensitive organizational models.

Yet when it comes to government services, many of us are ready to take to the
barricades to defend their public-sector monopolies in a number of areas,
including health care and education. What's even more amazing is employees of
those monopolies defend the status quo, even when it's to their detriment.

The current unrest in the health-care sector provides a vivid example. It's easy
to see why the Health Employees Union, which represents hospital cleaners,
painters, gardeners and other non-technical support staff, would want to
maintain their monopoly. Their compensation is higher than counterparts
performing the same duties in other industries. Their staffing levels are higher
in public hospitals than in private medical facilities.

The most recent study I've seen that compares unionized non-technical workers in
a B.C. hospital with unionized workers in the hotel industry was conducted in
1995 by the Fraser Institute. While the numbers are now out of date, the trend
they illustrate is not.

Comparing Royal Colum-bian Hospital in New Westminster and private hotels in the
region, the report concluded that Royal Columbian's budget on the related wages
would be reduced by $5.4 million if its workers were paid the same as their
private-sector counterparts.

It is completely understandable why the HEU would oppose private health care in
an attempt to protect its members, but the case is not so clear with the nurses'
union.

Nurses in the public system are clearly underpaid in comparison to their
counterparts in private clinics in B.C. Their wages in the public sector are
lower than public-sector nurses in Alberta and numerous parts in the States. In
the States, the presence of so many private facilities makes the competition for
nurses intense, which in turn forces their wages up in both the public and
private sector.

Which may explain why in a study released last year, Stats Can found that
fourteen nurses were leaving the country for the United States for every one
that came here from the U.S.

The benefits to nurses of more open competition have not been lost on their
counterparts in other countries. In Sweden, for example, the National Union of
Nurses has been instrumental in the establishment and ownership of private
clinics which contract a variety of medical services to the government. With the
full support of the nurses, the Union of Doctors and four other health-care
unions, 150 small to mid-sized private facilities have been established in the
past seven years.

One of the results has been that the nurses have seen their wages increase
between 1995-99 at a rate that is three times faster than in the previous
five-year period, and their working conditions have improved. These clinics have
also saved the government 15 per cent on health-care costs, compared to similar
services in the public system.

While any suggestion to have government contract out the delivery of health-care
services to privately owned facilities is met with the predictable howls of
imminent Armageddon, the fact remains that nurses would see a significant
benefit from increasing the competition for their important skills.

Student dies in U.S. 41 accident

BYLINE: JIM ROSS; KELLY RYAN

SECTION: CITRUS TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 745 words

DATELINE: INVERNESS



A Withlacoochee Technical Institute student was killed in a vehicle accident
Wednesday morning as she drove to school on U.S. 41 S. Two passengers, both  WTI
students, suffered minor injuries.

The driver was Peggy Ann Griffis, 19, of Webster. Her passengers were Yja
Michelle Russell, 19, of Bushnell and Ammanda Phillips, 17, of Webster.

The women were driving north on the highway in a 1996 Ford Ranger pickup  that
belonged to Griffis' fiance, the Florida Highway Patrol reported.

About 8:30 a.m., when she was a half- mile south of the county fairgrounds,
Griffis moved into the southbound lane and tried to pass another vehicle. When
a car came toward her, Griffis veered onto the west shoulder.

By then, Trooper G.W. Reaves reported, the pickup truck was out of control.
Griffis traveled back onto the highway and the vehicle overturned, ejecting
her.

Witnesses and authorities said the truck rolled three to five times before
landing on the west shoulder. It never struck another vehicle.

Griffis was dead on arrival at Citrus Memorial Hospital, hospital  spokeswoman
Megan Carella said. Russell and Phillips were treated for minor  injuries.

The women were not wearing seat belts, said Chuck Russell, Yja's father.

Chuck Russell said the three women were friends. Most days, they took a  school
bus from South Sumter High School to WTI, a regional vocational school  that
takes in students from Sumter, Hernando and Citrus counties.

Wednesday, however, Griffis' fiance was scheduled to work a late shift.  Since
his truck was available, the three decided to drive.

Phillips went to the Russell home to meet Yja and Griffis, who had stayed  the
night at her fiance's home.

"My daughter told me they weren't running late," Russell said.

The accident came just as Griffis was embarking upon a major change in her
life. Griffis became engaged to Arron Sovocool in December. The couple planned
to move to New York next month, where she hoped to become a kindergarten
teacher.

"She was gung-ho," Sovocool said. "She was high-spirited, always happy,
cheerful. Always, everybody came first before her."

Griffis had lived in Sumter County on and off for many years, with a brief  time
in Mississippi about six years ago. "Just being around her would make  you
smile," Sovocool said. "She was always there for me."

Employees at the Winn-Dixie food store in Bushnell, where Griffis worked  behind
the deli counter, shared that sentiment.

Though only employed at the store the past three weeks, Griffis was well  liked
and considered a hard worker who was not afraid to get on her knees to  clean.

"She's a real sweet, pretty girl," said Mary Riggs, who helped train  Griffis
and worked a shift with her Tuesday night. "She had her life planned  out ahead
of her. She just worked her way into my heart."

Russell said his daughter - whose name is pronounced WHY-ja - is known as
"Lady" to family and friends.

She received state certification as a child care worker and is on track to  earn
her high school degree in December. She hopes to attend college in  Alabama,
where her grandmother lives.

In May, she and Griffis were among the dozen WTI students who participated  in a
class project called "Campaign '96, C-SPAN in the Classroom." Their  teacher,
Donna Olsen, received an honor from Time Warner Cable and C-SPAN.

The women also teamed up with a third classmate, David French, to win first
place in the physical science team competition in the 1996 county science  fair.

The academic camaraderie mirrored their home lives. The women had been  friends
for years and when Griffis' parents moved to North Florida, Griffis  stayed with
the Russell family.

Phillips' mother, Deah Hammond, said her daughter is learning to repair  auto
bodies, among other things.

About two hours after the accident, Russell was crying outside Citrus
Memorial's waiting room. He had just learned that his daughter was injured and
the woman he treated like a daughter had died.

During an interview later, Russell said he had dramatically mixed feelings.

"I'm very pleased," he said, "and again, sad, because Peggy was such a  good
friend for her."

Though he does not know how the accident occurred, Chuck Russell is  confident
about one fact: "From now on," he said of his daughter, "she will  be wearing
her seat belt."

Rajouri residents want more medical facilities in hospital

LENGTH: 317 words

DATELINE: Rajouri


Rajouri, April 25 -- Complaining of a shortage of doctors and medical amenities
including equipment in the 200-bedded regional hospital, residents of Rajouri in
Kashmir called for better medical facilities at the hospital.

People complained about lack of basic medical facilities and said that usually
they have to rush elsewhere during an emergency. "I feel very sad to say that
there are a lot of problems inside the hospital whether it is the number of
staff or adequate machines.

Though many machines has been provided by the government, there is a lack of
technical staff to handle the technical devices.

There are not even 22 staff members to take care of all the technical machinery.
It is my humble request to the government, whether it is the ruling government
or someone fighting the election from here to raise this matter in one of the
parliament sessions,"said a patient's relative, Zahir Abbas. Residents also said
that the absence of medical staff and facilities makes it very difficult during
emergency as they are compelled to rush elsewhere for treatment.

Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Rajouri district, Rajiv Sharma, said
that the government has assured that proper measures would be taken to upgrade
the machinery. "It is the biggest district with the population of 6.41 lakh
(641million) and sometimes the hospital is also loaded with patients from Poonch
district and all our medical staff as well as doctors work with utmost
dedication.

All the issues faced by patients will be resolved after the election.I am
assuring all the residents of my district that we will ensure proper functioning
of all the sophisticated machines for the speedy recovery of the patients,"
Sharma said.

Drugs Danger Alert To Pupils

BYLINE: Evening Chronicle

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS, Pg. 1

LENGTH: 172 words


   Police are to make a series of visits to schools in North Tyneside to warn
pupils of the danger of drugs.

It comes after the area was rocked by two drugs scandals within a week involving
children.

Fourteen youngsters aged 14 and 15 at Norham Community Technical College in
North Shields needed hospital treatment after taking sleeping pills which were
taken from a medicine cabinet.

Seven youths from nearby Wallsend collapsed and were taken to hospital after a
drink and drugs binge a week ago.

Police said today they were treating the latest incident as 'extremely serious'.
They are to send officers into schools in the area to urge teenagers to stay
away from drugs.

Chief Insp Derek Scott of North Shields police said: "We are obviously concerned
that 14 youngsters ended up in hospital. Although the drugs were fairly mild,
they were not to know that.

"Officers are going to the school to provide drug education advice to avoid a
similar situation arising again."

WHO drew attention ongoing MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia

LENGTH: 792  words


CENEVRE (C[#x130]HAN)- With the upcoming Hajj, one of the most important
religious observances in Islam expected to fall between September 21-26 2015,
the World Health Organisation (WHO) drew attention today in Geneva to the
ongoing MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in Saudi Arabia.



Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, Technical Expert at WHO, says that "we have, as you know,
had and still have a fairly large outbreak ongoing in Riyadh, involving mainly
one hospital but also additional hospitals. So far in Riyadh, linked to that
hospital, we have more than 115 cases - if I remember correctly - and we also
have a small hospital outbreak ongoing in Medina, which is part of the holy
sites."

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by
a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in
2012. The virus appears to be circulating throughout the Arabian Peninsula.
Several cases, however, have also been reported outside the Middle East. Most
people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness,
including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

The challenge with MERS is that the symptoms are not very specific to the
disease, and are difficult to recognise. Hence, health care workers would not
immediately think of the disease and have patients immediately isolated.

The WHO expert describes "that is a very big challenge for all health care
systems in the world, that was also one of the main messages of the last
emergency committee on the ... for MERS that there is not enough awareness
around MERS globally and that is really something we have to push for from all
side and make sure that all the actors and partners are contributing to increase
that awareness for this new emerging disease which is still very serious and and
of very large concern for the international health community."

WHO reported to journalists in Geneva also about 11 cases in Amman, Jordan and
said that more than 1,564 cases of MERS have been reported globally, and more
than 550 people have died as the disease has a fairly high fatality rate.

However, Dr. Peter Ben Embarek said that WHO does not recommend the application
of any travel or trade restrictions, adding that, "there is no travel advice or
recommendation made by WHO or any national authorities for MERS because you
can't, it is not efficient to introduce travel measures. Of course, when and
that is common sense, but it is unfortunately not a reflex in any individuals:
When you come back from travel and have suddenly symptoms of a respiratory
disease and you go to the hospital to see the doctor, it is extremely important
to remember to say 'Oh by the way, I was travelling last week or two weeks ago
and I went to this and these places' ".  STORY: GENEVA / MERS PRESSER

Hospitals struck off RGJAY list

BYLINE: Nozia Sayyed

SECTION: CIVIC

LENGTH: 485 words


Inactivity, delays and lack of manpower have led to four city hospitals,
including AFMC, being delisted in the last six months.

Lack of initiative and lackadaisical attitudes have got many hospitals in the
state de-empanelled from the Rajeev Gandhi Jeevandayi Arogya Yojana (RGJAY).
This year alone, more than 10 hospitals have been de-empanelled of which four
are from Pune - Dhanashree, Pioneer, Deokate and Armed Forces Medical College
(AFMC). In the last three years, the state has delisted 70- odd hospitals for
being inactive and denying patients care.

"Hospitals that have been delisted were not active and made no effort to
popularise the scheme or enroll cases. Also, there were complaints from patients
that several hospitals were denying treatment," Piyush Singh, chief executive
officer of the scheme for Maharashtra, told Mirror.

Singh added that hospitals were served several notices to improve their services
before being delisted. Elaborating on AFMC, a governmentrun medical college and
hospital, Singh said, "They had administrative and technical issues due to which
they were delisted, though they treated patients under the scheme.
Unfortunately, they never claimed any money from the insurance companies for the
procedures they performed, which should have been done. This was the main reason
we had to delist them as they never had an account opened for our scheme where
we could transfer the claims."

Chief administrative officer of Dhanashree Hospital, Nilesh Shirsagar, said,
"There were many issues related to payment - funds were delayed and there were
protocols that needed to be followed which included constant travel to Mumbai.
Besides this, patient flow under this scheme was limited due to which we
remained inactive and were eventually removed from the panel."

Pioneer Hospital's director Dr Samadhan Kshirsagar, said, "We requested a
removal ourselves as we lacked manpower to handle private patients and those
under the government scheme. So, we requested the CEO to exclude us from the
service."

Sources at AFMC said, "Since AFMC is run by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), an
MoU was proposed between the government of Maharashtra and MoD for the scheme.
However, due to technical reasons, it did not materialise and the scheme never
started officially for us. But, we do treat civilians at Command Hospital where
beds are reserved for the same. AFMC's name was removed from the updated list on
the Yojana website due to technical glitches and delays."

Singh suggested that existing hospitals that wish to stay with the scheme should
conduct health camps, identify patients and get them registered under the scheme
so that patients, along with the hospitals, benefit.

protocols that needed to be followed which included constant travel to Mumbai

'Technical Glitch' Sees Clinics Running Out of Chronic Medication

BYLINE: Peter Luhanga

LENGTH: 415 words


Some chronically ill patients in the Western Cape have had to go for days
without taking their prescribed medication at some state hospitals as a new
contractor appointed to provide prepackaged chronic medication has been
experiencing "technical glitches".

At the beginning of the month the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health
appointed UTi Pharma to take over the management of the Chronic Dispensing Unit
(CDU) from Institutional Pharmacy Management (IPM) whose five year contract had
come to an end.

On Friday, two weeks later, Western Cape Minister of Health Theuns Botha said
there had been "some operational problems" in transferring the details of about
200 000 patients from the old CDU system to the new operator which resulted in
problems in the dispensing of chronic medication to patients.

However, he said on Friday that the situation had just been resolved.

But the technical glitches created a "huge" backlog in the dispensing of chronic
medication at some state hospitals.

At Retreat Community Hospital, a senior health official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said because UTi Pharma was unable to provide pre-packaged chronic
medication, they had a week-long backlog.

"We have asked patients who have a supply of medicines to come back next week.
Those (patients) who have nothing, we are trying to assist them," he said.

He said because the work had to be done manually, a patient would be seen by a
doctor and told to come the next day to get medication

He said the majority of their patients who had been inconvenienced were
suffering from diabetes and hypertension but the situation was normal for
patients suffering from Tuberculosis and HIV/Aids.

Western Cape Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) field facilitator Neliswa Mkwai
said that at a partnership meeting with fellow stakeholders such as the Simelela
Aids Forum on Wednesday April 11, some patients in attendance had complained
that they had been unable to get their chronic mediation for three days.

Some city run clinics depending on the CDU were also affected, said a senior
city health official who did not want to be named because only politicians
serving in mayoral committee positions are authorised to speak to the media.

Botha said the issues had not been life threatening.

"There is an overlap. We reverted to dispensing the medication manually which
created discomfort to our patients. There was a delay. Patients had to wait for
three days to get medication. We apologise for the inconvenience," he said.

   Medical Resources Management, Inc., incorporated in 1991, makes mobile
laser/surgical services available to its customers by providing this equipment
on a per-procedure basis to hospitals, outpatient surgery centers and
physicians' offices. The Company provides these mobile lasers with technical
support to ensure the lasers are working correctly for the physicians. The
Company also provides other medical equipment on a rental basis to hospitals and
surgery centers. This equipment is used throughout these facilities to
supplement their requirement for certain medical equipment. The Company's
largest wholly owned operating subsidiary, Physiologic Reps, Inc. (PRI),
produces approximately 82% and 75% of the Company's consolidated revenues during
the fiscal years ended October 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In July 2001,
the Company was acquired by Emergent Group Inc., a New York-based merchant
banking firm.

   The Company's laser/surgical services focus on two of the most rapidly
growing areas of the healthcare industry, managed care and cosmetic surgery. For
managed care, minimally invasive procedures can be performed by physicians at
hospitals that rent its laser equipment. For cosmetic surgery, by renting the
Company's equipment, the physicians benefit from having a multitude of different
laser technologies available to offer to their patients without the burden of
investing a significant amount of money. In both instances, physicians and
hospitals receive technical support and expertise provided with the equipment,
allowing the staff to concentrate on their duties without the additional tasks
of running a laser.

   Medical Resources Management has approximately 600 active surgical service
accounts in California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado and Nevada, and experiences a
high rate of repeat business from the hospitals, surgery centers and doctors it
serves. The market encompasses many disciplines including plastic/cosmetic
surgery, dermatology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, urology, obstetrics,
gynecology, ophthalmology, general surgery, podiatry and dentistry. Equipment is
becoming more specialized to the medical procedures involved and technical
training of the physician, regarding the use of equipment, is a significant part
of the Company's business.

   The Company's technicians deliver equipment and provide technical support to
physicians and operating room (O.R.) personnel, as needed. Once its technician
is at the customer site, he or she posts required warning notices outside the
O.R., issues safety equipment to the O.R. staff, provides any disposable
materials needed and supplies equipment certifications or documentation required
for hospital record-keeping. The Company's technician sets the physician's
requested power settings and maintains a laser-safe environment during the
surgical procedure. More than 60% of the Company's revenue was generated from
the rental of technician-supported equipment (including related disposable
sales) during each of the last two fiscal years.

   The Company's lasers encompass the latest technology in CO2, Nd:YAG, Pulse
Dye, KTP/YAG and Holmium YAG models. The Company has established a working
relationship with laser manufacturers, receives new laser technology in its
markets and is constantly reviewing developments in the medical laser field to
stay aware of the latest technology available.

   Medical Resources Management also provides its customers with disposable
products and/or attachments that are needed for a given procedure. This applies
primarily to laser-related rentals requiring laser drapes, masks, fibers and
tubing. The customers benefit from this added service since they save the added
costs that would be incurred if they had to purchase a large inventory of these
disposable products.

   Additionally, the Company offers a broad spectrum of general medical
equipment to the medical market that it serves. Its inventory of equipment
includes an extensive selection of devices, serving a broad range of hospital
departments and needs such as adult and infant ventilators, CO2 monitors,
defibrillators, feeding pumps, PCA pumps, ECG monitors, infusion pumps,
neo-natal monitors and pulse oximeters. Due in part to its varied inventory of
equipment, the Company is usually capable of offering delivery and support of
rental items with only a few hours' notice. Mobile laser/surgical services are
ordered in advance and re-confirmed with the customer the day before the
procedure by the scheduling department.

LENGTH: 288  words


New Delhi, Oct. 21 -- Michelle Mills, chief executive officer (CEO) of Colorado
Rural Health Center (CRHC), has been appointed to the TASC Advisory Committee, a
program of the National Rural Health Resource Center.



The appointment to the TASC Advisory Committee will run through August 31, 2015.
Comprised of a diverse group of professionals - the Committee serves as a
sounding board and advisement group of technical experts to ensure that the TASC
program is staying ahead of the curve and keeping the pulse on the needs and
issues in rural communities, CAHs and state FLEX programs.

The TASC program supports the forty- five states participating in the FLEX
program and the 1,300 + CAHs they serve. TASC work aligns with the state FLEX
grant to provide technical assistance, education, resources and awareness in the
areas of: quality improvement; financial and operational improvement, and
healthy system development. Other programs include Small Rural Hospital
Improvement Grant (SHIP) and Rural Hospital Performance Improvement Project
(RHPI).

Mills is widely known as a leading authority for rural health care in Colorado,
with over 20 years of experience in the nonprofit sector dedicated to quality
improvement and patient safety. Prior to becoming CEO in August 2012, Mills was
the Director of Programs at CRHC and oversaw not only the FLEX program, but
numerous technical support programs and services.

"It is a privilege to be given the opportunity to help address the significant
healthcare challenges facing Critical Access Hospitals, said Mills. "I look
forward to sharing Colorado's best practices and working with the other Advisory
Committee appointees to ensure healthcare programs are more accessible in
rural."

Look to the right for a sense of humor

BYLINE: German Research Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. C11

LENGTH: 211 words

DATELINE: BONN, W. Germany


   BONN - Man's sense of humor is located in the right half of the brain which
is specializing in the psychosomatic-intuitive processing of information.

This is not because of this side's allegedly greater emotionality, but because
the left, analytical-logical side of the brain has no feeling for the
absurdities or double entendres contained in the point of a joke.

Dr. Manfred Dagge and Prof. Wolfgang Hartje of the neurological department at
Aachen Technical University Hospital conducted experiments with patients who had
suffered damage to the right side of the brain following a stroke. Both patients
and control persons were presented with a cartoon and three similar but
pointless drawings. The patients were unable to determine which drawing was
humorous far more frequently than normal persons or patients whose left side of
the brain was damaged.

It was obvious that this inability to realize humorous situations did not stem
from reduced emotionality because once a cartoon had been identified as funny
they found them just as amusing as the other test persons did. The American
psychologist Paul E. McGhee concludes from similar experiments that the left
side of the brain doggedly follows and develops a straight line of thought.

Eden nurses strike averted;
100 TECHNICAL WORKERS MAY STRIKE IF ACCORD ISN'T REACHED

BYLINE: Sandra Gonzales Mercury News

SECTION: B; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 297 words


Nurses at Castro Valley's Eden Medical Center averted a strike by reaching a
tentative agreement early Tuesday.

The nurses had been set to walk the picket line Friday in a contract dispute
over wages and retirement benefits.

Despite Tuesday's tentative agreement, at least 100 technical workers,
represented by the Teamsters, haven't reached a contract settlement with the
hospital and are prepared to strike Friday. Those workers include pharmacy
employees, and lab and X-ray technicians.

Hospital officials said they have arranged for other licensed technical staff
members to fill any open positions during the strike.

"We're hopeful we can reach a conclusion prior to that end," said Cassandra
Phelps, a hospital spokeswoman.

The tentative agreement, which affects 350 registered nurses, is expected to be
ratified Thursday.

"A strike is never what anybody wants to do," said Liz Jacobs, a spokeswoman for
the California Nurses Association. "What we're trying to do with these
agreements is improve and introduce retirement plans. We're looking at things to
retain and attract new nurses to the profession."

As part of the settlement, the nurses will receive an 18 percent wage increase
during the next three years, setting the salary range for a full-time nurse at
$75,000 to $93,000 a year.

The new contract also includes improvements in staffing and health care
benefits, some of the main points of contention. Nurses who are at least 55
years of age with more than 10 years of experience will receive
employer-subsidized post-retirement health care coverage based on years of
service.

"Although it was a difficult process, it reached a fair conclusion," Phelps
said.

Bouygues wins contract to develop two buildings at Hautepierre Hospital in
France

LENGTH: 304 words


Bouygues Construction subsidiaries, Pertuy Construction and Norpac have secured
a contract worth more than (EURO)80m to develop two buildings at Hautepierre
Hospital in Strasbourg, France.

Designed by Ingerop and developed by Groupe 6, the project includes the
construction of two buildings; one will be a regional cancer institute and the
other a medico-technical and locomotor facility.

The buildings will be connected to each other and to an existing structure
through underground passages and pedestrian bridges.

With a surface area of 30,000m², the eight-storey regional cancer institute will
house a radiotherapy unit equipped with seven bunkers for particle accelerators,
a nuclear medicine unit, a 122-bed conventional hospital block, a 38-bed
specialist hospital unit and a 72-bed oncology and haematology day hospital.

Additionally, it will have space for external consultants, as well as offices
and service facilities to support the various units.

The 11-floor medico-technical and locomotor facility will be built on an area of
around 41,000m².

This building will feature an arrivals area, logistical platform, a central
sterilisation unit, a 164-seat lecture theatre equipped with conference rooms,
an area for external consultations in disciplines not covered at the facility
and an extension of the site's imaging unit.

In addition, the facility will have two surgical units with 15 and 17 theatres
respectively, a 30-bed day-surgery hospital, a continuous monitoring unit with
16 beds, six conventional hospital units each with 28 beds and associated
support services.

Construction work will be handled by Pertuy, including structural work, walls
and covering, drywall, finishing work, roadways and infrastructural networks.

The project is scheduled to start in early July and is expected to take 42
months to complete.

AfDB Calls for Proper Vetting of Contractors

BYLINE: Prossy Nandudu

LENGTH: 223 words


The African Development Bank (AfDB) wants all contractors interested in the
renovation of Mulago Hospital and the construction of two other hospitals in
Kawempe and Kiruddu to be vetted.

This will eliminate contractors who are busy, have poor records of service
delivery from the race to take up the project. The appeal was made by AfDB
country representative, Patrick Khayemba Simiyu.

"When contractors are not prequalified, there is a danger of taking on weak
contractors, who are not committed. Once someone is not committed, then the
delivery of services will be affected," Khayemba said.

He was speaking at the technical launch of the Improvement of Health services
Delivery at Mulago

Hospital and the City of Kampala project being supported by the bank, at the
Sheraton Kampala Hotel recently.

The technical launch was aimed at familiarising technical experts with the
project objectives, components and bank rules in areas of disbursement,
procurement and financial management and the level of governance required to
manage the project.

The project is aimed at increasing access to quality and affordable health care
services for the people of Kampala and the metropolitan areas.

It also aims at transforming Mulago Hospital into a centre of excellence in
health care service delivery and education and training for health sciences
students.

Nurses reach deal, avoiding strike;
But 100 technical workers at Eden still plan to picket Friday unless a contract
is made

BYLINE: Sandra Gonzales MERCURY NEWS

SECTION: A; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 284 words


Nurses at Castro Valley's Eden Medical Center averted a strike by reaching a
tentative agreement early Tuesday morning.

The nurses had been set to walk the picket line Friday in a contract dispute
over wages and retirement benefits.

Despite Tuesday's agreement, at least 100 technical workers, represented by the
Teamsters, haven't reached a contract settlement with the hospital and are
prepared to strike Friday. Those workers include pharmacy employees, lab
technicians and X-ray technicians.

Hospital officials said they have arranged for other licensed technical staff to
fill any open positions during the strike.

"We're hopeful we can reach a conclusion prior to that end," said Cassandra
Phelps, a hospital spokeswoman.

The tentative agreement, which affects 350 registered nurses, is expected to be
ratified Thursday.

"A strike is never what anybody wants to do," said Liz Jacobs, a spokeswoman for
the California Nurses Association. "What we're trying to do with these
agreements is improve and introduce retirement plans. We're looking at things to
retain and attract new nurses to the profession."

As part of the settlement, the nurses will receive an 18 percent wage increase
during the next three years, setting the salary range for a full-time nurse at
$75,000 to $93,000 a year.

The new contract also includes improvements in staffing and health care
benefits, some of the main points of contention. Nurses who are at least 55
years of age with more than 10 years of experience will receive
employer-subsidized post-retirement health care coverage based on years of
service.

"Although it was a difficult process, it reached a fair conclusion," Phelps
said.

New center builds up hopes;
Jobs, workshops, events part of plan.;
Lanier Tech's goals include medical programs, more.

BYLINE: Laura Raines; For the AJC

SECTION: AJCJOBS; Pg. 1G

LENGTH: 1062 words


Government and business leaders expect to get more than education from Lanier
Technical College's new Forsyth Conference Center and Health Care Building,
located on its Cumming campus in Forsyth County.

Lanier Tech held a ribbon-cutting for the $12.7 million building --- the result
of more than 10 years of planning --- on Oct. 26.

"Its multipurpose design makes it an economic tool for the county and an
instructional site for work force development, which is the oldest mission we
have as a technical college," said Lanier Tech President Russell Vandiver.

The top two floors of the 60,000-square-foot facility will comprise classrooms
and labs for teaching allied health sciences. The college plans to reproduce
programs such as medical assisting, surgical technology and radiology technology
from its Oakwood campus, but it is also seeking accreditation to add new
programs such as diagnostic medical sonography and teaching physical therapy
assistants, personal trainer technicians and medical skin care assistants.

These programs will feed into work force needs of hospitals along the Ga. 400
corridor --- Northside Hospital-Forsyth, North Fulton Regional Hospital and
Emory Johns Creek Hospital --- and the growing medical community in the area.

"We work with local health care advisers to make sure that we're training the
work force they need," Vandiver said. "Health care is one of the biggest growth
sectors in the economy of this region. While none of us knows what will happen
with health care in the future, we know that they will need trained workers."

While two-thirds of the building will serve traditional, educational purposes,
Lanier Tech is moving in uncharted territory by opening a 14,000-square-foot
meeting and conference center on the building's main floor.

Other technical colleges have added conference centers, but this is the first
venture in Forsyth County.

Vandiver calls the conference center an economic tool for the county, something
that can drive more hospitality dollars into the region, spur new jobs and
support local businesses by providing them a place to meet and hold work force
training.

"We've had tremendous support from the county in making this happen," Vandiver
said.

Forsyth County gave $1 million in voter-approved SPLOST VI funding for the
project.

"We're very excited about this project and thank Forsyth residents for their
role in making it a reality" Forsyth County Manager Doug Derrer said. "There has
been a very clear need for a facility such as this in the county. There is no
doubt that it will serve as an important gathering space for the community."

The key will be making the conference center's operating budget self-sustaining,
a job that falls to new conference center Director Sara Harrison.

She knows her facility fills a need.

"Groups have had to go out of the county to hold any large event because there
wasn't a space large enough here," Harrison said.

Fittingly, the center's inaugural event will be the 600-person annual dinner for
the Cumming-Forsyth Chamber of Commerce, an event that has had to be held in
Fulton County in recent years.

The chamber is also eyeing the facility for its annual small-business expo.
Other interested prospects include Business 400, a network of businesses along
the Ga. 400 corridor from Sandy Springs to Dahlonega who like its central
location, and the 400 North Board of Realtors.

"There are many conference centers around the state, and we did a complete
market analysis in setting our rates and target market," Harrison said.

Two high school proms are already booked, and Harrison has given quotes for
numerous weddings. But she also plans to make the center a go-to place for
corporate training by local businesses.

"Our rooms break down to different sizes, and we're equipped with the latest
projection system, video-conferencing capability, catering services and laptop
rental," Harrison said. "We asked local companies what they needed and then
provided more. It's a turnkey operation. All they have to do is show up and get
down to business."

The building will add jobs in new staff and provide training for students in
high school culinary programs. She also expects it to boost hospitality-sector
dollars and development.

A major hotel chain has plans to build next to The Avenue, a neighboring
shopping center. With proximity to Ga. 400, Lake Lanier and the North Georgia
mountains, and nearby shopping and dining available, Harrison foresees no
difficulties in selling the center as an alternative to more urban meeting
places.

"I'm confident that we will have the business we want and need to be
sustainable, and that this building will strengthen our ties with the local
business community," Harrison said.

Vandiver is already thinking of classes for entrepreneurs, franchisees and
small-business startups. Having started a successful ammonia refrigeration
program and a Manufacturing Development Center, his economic development staff
is aware of the needs for small-business support in the county.

"This conference center will be a game-changing piece of infrastructure for our
community," said James McCoy, president and CEO of the Cumming-Forsyth County
Chamber of Commerce. "On the most basic level it's a venue for all kinds of
organizations and businesses to meet close to home. That's practical and good
for tax dollars, but I also foresee us being able to attract business and
visitor dollars from other counties."

Government and business leaders had long considered a conference center a top
priority, he said. According to the latest U.S. Census figures, Forsyth is still
among the 10 fastest-growing counties in the country (in terms of percentage of
growth).

"We've seen seven new economic development projects, the creation of 344 new
jobs and companies spending $40 million in new capital investment this year,"
McCoy said. "Our unemployment rate is 8.3 percent, which is lower than state and
national numbers, and we are working through our existing housing inventory
faster than surrounding counties."

He believes that the county's strategy to attract small and mid-size businesses
from different industries, rather than one major employer, has given it a
stronger economy.

"So has the very thoughtful investment in key infrastructures, like this new
conference building," McCoy said. "I'm not worried at all about it being used.
It's going to be a great asset."

have secured a contract worth more than [#x20ac]80m to develop two buildings at
Hautepierre Hospital in Strasbourg, France.


Bouygues Construction subsidiaries, Pertuy Construction and Norpac have secured
a contract worth more than [#x20ac]80m to develop two buildings at Hautepierre
Hospital in Strasbourg, France.

Designed by Ingerop and developed by Groupe 6, the project includes the
construction of two buildings; one will be a regional cancer institute and the
other a medico-technical and locomotor facility.

The buildings will be connected to each other and to an existing structure
through underground passages and pedestrian bridges.

With a surface area of 30,000m², the eight-storey regional cancer institute will
house a radiotherapy unit equipped with seven bunkers for particle accelerators,
a nuclear medicine unit, a 122-bed conventional hospital block, a 38-bed
specialist hospital unit and a 72-bed oncology and haematology day hospital.

Additionally, it will have space for external consultants, as well as offices
and service facilities to support the various units.

The 11-floor medico-technical and locomotor facility will be built on an area of
around 41,000m².

This building will feature an arrivals area, logistical platform, a central
sterilisation unit, a 164-seat lecture theatre equipped with conference rooms,
an area for external consultations in disciplines not covered at the facility
and an extension of the site's imaging unit.

In addition, the facility will have two surgical units with 15 and 17 theatres
respectively, a 30-bed day-surgery hospital, a continuous monitoring unit with
16 beds, six conventional hospital units each with 28 beds and associated
support services.

Construction work will be handled by Pertuy, including structural work, walls
and covering, drywall, finishing work, roadways and infrastructural networks.

The project is scheduled to start in early July and is expected to take 42
months to complete.

-[#x20ac][#x2dc]True Bartonian-[#x20ac][TM] that helped to save hospital is
remembered

BYLINE: MATTHEW COBB

LENGTH: 394  words


Chris Baker

TRIBUTES have been paid to an East Staffordshire man who was influential in
helping to save Barton Cottage Hospital from possible closure.

Chris Baker, who has been described as 'a true Bartonian' died at his holiday
home in Portugal on April 4. He was 72-years-old. His funeral, which was
attended by more than 300 people, was held at the Parish Church in Barton on
Friday. He is survived by his widow Jen, and two children Simon and Victoria.

When the hospital was put under consultation, Chris became a leading figure in
the campaign to save it from closure and an instrumental chairman of the Barton
Cottage Hospital Action Group. He dedicated much of his time to running the
group, which gained significant  support from the local community.

In February 2002 they succeeded in their mission when a decision was made to
build a new health centre and community hospital on the existing site.

As a child Mr Baker attended the Thomas Russell School and the Technical High
School in Burton before starting an apprenticeship at George Hodges in the town
when he was 16, staying there until he was 60. During that time he gained a
degree and served as a quantity surveyor, cycling to work each day.

He maintained a keen interest in sports throughout his life, taking a particular
interest in football with the Technical High School old boys, which was soon
followed by cricket and hockey. Furthermore he was a keen walker, often meeting
with friends once a week as well as being an enthusiastic member of Branston
Golf Club. Chris also joined Bretby Rotary Club in order to keep himself busy.

Chris' close friend Tony Wood, who was the Vicar of Barton under Needwood during
the fight to keep the hospital open also served as public awareness team leader
for the group. He says that the pair attended 50 meetings within a 12-month
period to try and keep the hospital open. He paid tributes to Chris and his
achievements in helping to save the hospital.

Mr Wood told the Mail: "Chris had discussions, often privately with the NHS
authorities. He had determination to see the job through and his perseverance
sometimes was against all odds.

"The group was there to back him, but without Chris we would not have succeeded.
Barton Cottage Wing today is a kind of memorial to him, and hundreds in the past
six years since its opening have reason to be grateful."

Company suspends trading after death

BYLINE: Zhu Wenqian

SECTION: COMPANIES

LENGTH: 378 words


A Shanghai-listed company suspended trading of its shares on Tuesday in the wake
of the death of 21-year-old cancer patient Wei Zexi.

The company, VCANBIO Cell & Gene Engineering Corp, issued a public statement in
March on the acquisition of 100 percent of the equity in Shanghai Claison
Bio-tech Co, with investment of 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million).

Clasion provided immunotherapy technology services for the Second Hospital of
the Beijing Armed Police Corps, where Wei received immunotherapy treatment.

Wei learned about the treatment from search engine giant Baidu, but died last
month from a rare form of cancer.

Since news of his death broke, it has been impossible to access Clasion's
website, which is displaying the words "coming soon".

Asked if there was a connection between Clasion and the hospital, VCANBIO's
general manager Wu Mingyuan said it was not possible to give a response at
present and the company would release a statement later.

Clasion's main business involves research and development of cellular
immunotherapy and providing technical services for medical institutions.

The company's technical services for this therapy include using a patient's own
cells to fight cancer, and the controversy over Wei's death centers on such
therapy.

Earlier, VCANBIO said it intends to acquire Kangxin Hospital Investment and
Management Co. This hospital manages the domain name of the tumor diagnosis and
biological treatment center of the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police
Corps.

Clasion and Kangxin are both controlled by Chen Xinxi and Chen Xinxian from
Putian, Fujian province.

Another listed company saw its stocks plunge on Tuesday.

Shares in Hua Xia Healthcare Holdings dropped by 13 percent to close at 53 Hong
Kong cents ($0.06). The company is controlled by Weng Jiajin, the son of Putian
businessman Weng Guoliang.

Ji Xuwo, a healthcare analyst at Orient Securities in Beijing, said: "This case
is expected to accelerate the launch of standardized regulations on the cellular
therapy industry in China. The sector lacks supervision and quality control in
specific clinical applications.

"The private medical care system in China will in future focus on medical
quality, and only those companies that can provide value for patients can
achieve growth."

The company, VCANBIO Cell & Gene Engineering Corp, issued a public statement in
March on the acquisition of 100 percent of the equity in Shanghai Claison
Bio-tech Co, with investment of 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million).

Clasion provided immunotherapy technology services for the Second Hospital of
the Beijing Armed Police Corps, where Wei received immunotherapy treatment.

Wei learned about the treatment from search engine giant Baidu, but died last
month from a rare form of cancer.

Since news of his death broke, it has been impossible to access Clasion's
website, which is displaying the words "coming soon".

Asked if there was a connection between Clasion and the hospital, VCANBIO's
general manager Wu Mingyuan said it was not possible to give a response at
present and the company would release a statement later.

Clasion's main business involves research and development of cellular
immunotherapy and providing technical services for medical institutions.

The company's technical services for this therapy include using a patient's own
cells to fight cancer, and the controversy over Wei's death centers on such
therapy.

Earlier, VCANBIO said it intends to acquire Kangxin Hospital Investment and
Management Co. This hospital manages the domain name of the tumor diagnosis and
biological treatment center of the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police
Corps.

Clasion and Kangxin are both controlled by Chen Xinxi and Chen Xinxian from
Putian, Fujian province.

Another listed company saw its stocks plunge on Tuesday.

Shares in Hua Xia Healthcare Holdings dropped by 13 percent to close at 53 Hong
Kong cents ($0.06). The company is controlled by Weng Jiajin, the son of Putian
businessman Weng Guoliang.

Ji Xuwo, a healthcare analyst at Orient Securities in Beijing, said: "This case
is expected to accelerate the launch of standardized regulations on the cellular
therapy industry in China. The sector lacks supervision and quality control in
specific clinical applications.

"The private medical care system in China will in future focus on medical
quality, and only those companies that can provide value for patients can
achieve growth."

Nurse sketched war's face surgery wonders

BYLINE: Barbara Hebden

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 682 words


ALISON CAMPBELL

Nurse, artist, technical officer

Born Brisbane, March 10,

1917

Died Brisbane, September 5, 2005

DURING the traumatic days of World War II, Alison Campbell's task was to provide
"before and after" sketches of soldiers' horrific facial wounds to be treated by
plastic surgeons.

She was amazed in studying the transformation her sketches recorded -- a
lifetime memory of her contribution as a wartime nurse.

Alison Leone Campbell was the seventh child of Charles and Minnie Campbell and a
granddaughter of James Campbell, a pioneer in the 1860s of the timber, building
and hardware industries.

Her elder siblings were Jessie, Errol, Ken, Allan, Eleanor and John.

Alison was educated at the Presbyterian Girls School in Warwick and later
attended the Technical College art school in Brisbane two days a week, studying
English and French on the other days.

In 1936, after returning from overseas, she decided not to return to art school
but to specialise in retouching and tinting studio photographs.

Back in Australia after a short holiday in England in 1939, at the outbreak of
World War II, she believed it was her duty to join a voluntary aid detachment to
help with the war effort in a medical capacity.

Certificates in first aid and home nursing were a must. Going to these classes
was no easy matter as Brisbane was plunged into darkness but she was determined,
and passed her medical tests with flying colours before reporting to the
Greenslopes hospital.

Months of further training prepared her for her work after August 1942 when the
first casualties from the Kokoda Track in New Guinea poured into Greenslopes
hospital.

After two more years gaining further nursing experience at Greenslopes, she
realised the importance of her lessons at art school. A pioneer in plastic
surgery, a Major MacIndoe, asked her to make sketches of facial wounds before
and after surgery.

In early September 1944, Ms Campbell was transferred and her nursing continued
at Ingleburn Military Hospital in Sydney, before boarding the hospital ship the
Manunda to finally embark on her overseas posting.

Her thoughts rarely strayed from her memories of nursing badly burnt survivors
of the hospital ship Centaur, torpedoed by the Japanese off Point Lookout, North
Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, in 1944.

Her nursing career and medical sketching continued until her discharge in 1946.

Home in Brisbane, she resumed singing training in a government-sponsored
post-war reconstruction program. She combined this with writing for her
brother's advertising agency.

The activities of the ABC, housed in the same building as Campbell's advertising
agency, beckoned her. She joined the ABC in 1947, becoming the corporation's
first female technical operations sheet officer. Her duties included booking
landlines so that broadcasts from Brisbane including Russ Tyson's breakfast
program and his Hospital Hour, were transmitted to an Australia-wide audience.

She handled landline bookings for all broadcasts in and out of Brisbane for
parliamentary Question Time and all sporting programs, concerts and theatre
events.

A great supporter of the arts, she was a regular member of the audience at
concerts, dramas and ballets.

She was a member of the Fortitude Club, a friend of the Australian War Memorial,
a Women's Guide president and choir member of her church.

She was also a supporter of the RSPCA and Guide Dogs and a vice-president and
board member of the Clan Campbell Society.

Ms Campbell's personal achievements included the co-authorship in 1989 with her
cousin Morag Campbell of The James Campbell Story, bringing life to her family
heritage.

She did not marry.

Company suspends trading after death

BYLINE: Zhu Wenqian

LENGTH: 402  words


A Shanghai-listed company suspended trading of its shares on Tuesday in the wake
of the death of 21-year-old cancer patient Wei Zexi.

The company, VCANBIO Cell & Gene Engineering Corp, issued a public statement in
March on the acquisition of 100 percent of the equity in Shanghai Claison
Bio-tech Co, with investment of 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million).

Clasion provided immunotherapy technology services for the Second Hospital of
the Beijing Armed Police Corps, where Wei received immunotherapy treatment.

Wei learned about the treatment from search engine giant Baidu, but died last
month from a rare form of cancer.

Since news of his death broke, it has been impossible to access Clasion's
website, which is displaying the words "coming soon".

Asked if there was a connection between Clasion and the hospital, VCANBIO's
general manager Wu Mingyuan said it was not possible to give a response at
present and the company would release a statement later.

Clasion's main business involves research and development of cellular
immunotherapy and providing technical services for medical institutions.

The company's technical services for this therapy include using a patient's own
cells to fight cancer, and the controversy over Wei's death centers on such
therapy.

Earlier, VCANBIO said it intends to acquire Kangxin Hospital Investment and
Management Co. This hospital manages the domain name of the tumor diagnosis and
biological treatment center of the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police
Corps.

Clasion and Kangxin are both controlled by Chen Xinxi and Chen Xinxian from
Putian, Fujian province.

Another listed company saw its stocks plunge on Tuesday.

Shares in Hua Xia Healthcare Holdings dropped by 13 percent to close at 53 Hong
Kong cents ($0.06). The company is controlled by Weng Jiajin, the son of Putian
businessman Weng Guoliang.

Ji Xuwo, a healthcare analyst at Orient Securities in Beijing, said: "This case
is expected to accelerate the launch of standardized regulations on the cellular
therapy industry in China. The sector lacks supervision and quality control in
specific clinical applications.

"The private medical care system in China will in future focus on medical
quality, and only those companies that can provide value for patients can
achieve growth."

Pharmacy technical assistants do more than assist; Varied roles, opportunities:
Pharmacist shortage adds responsibility

BYLINE: MEGAN MARTIN, Freelance

SECTION: BUSINESS: WORKING; Pg. F12

LENGTH: 782  words


Batman had Robin, the Lone Ranger had Tonto and pharmacists have technicians.

"They're our right arm," said Martine Dubois, a pharmacist at Pharmaprix on
Cote-des-Neiges. "They play the key role in what we do."

Pharmacy technical assistants are specially trained workers who perform a large
variety of day-to-day tasks in a multitude of pharmacy settings.

In case you're wondering, yes, they're definitely more than assistants.

"They do everything from customer service in community pharmacies to preparing
cutting edge research medications in health care institutions," said Dubois, who
is also a teacher and coordinator of the Pharmacy Technical Assistance program
at Pearson Adult and Career Centre in LaSalle.

In hospital settings, technicians perform a wide range of tasks including
medication preparation, inventory maintenance in the main pharmacy and in
satellites, and management of automated medication machines.

"They have more responsibilities now than ever before," said Louise Senécal,
president of Association québecoise des assistant(e)s techniques en pharmacie
(AQATP). "Their role has evolved with changes in the industry."

In addition to having new responsibilities, technicians have also worked to
improve existing techniques.

"Instead of preparing medications for the duration of a patient's hospital stay,
techs are now preparing unit doses," Senécal said. "This means meds are prepared
on a daily basis, which reduces the amount of wasted medication if the patient
is taken off a regimen."

Senécal wears many hats. Aside from serving as the president of AQATP, she also
works as a technician at the Montreal Heart Institute and is a technical
instructor at Pearson Adult and Career Centre.

"I'm definitely very busy," she said. "But then again, most technicians are."

Five years ago, Senécal was part of a technical assistants rotating strike.

"The pharmacists told us that if the techs go on a full strike the pharmacy is
going to close," she recalled. "That's how important techs are to making
pharmacies function on a daily basis."

Whether working in a hospital setting or community pharmacy, technicians are
under constant pressure to perform at peak capacity.

"If pharmacists or technicians make a mistake we can kill someone," Dubois said.
"People go home with their meds and they trust us, they take the meds we give
them so we have to be sure of what we give."

Technicians in retail pharmacies are heavily involved with customer service.
They greet clients and collect information from them regarding insurance and
medical conditions such as pregnancy and diabetes. They enter the prescriptions
into the patient's file and prepare the medications taking into account any
dietary specifications or restrictions.

"Techs are also responsible for dosages," Dubois explained. "They have to take
into consideration the patient's weight and any allergies, and they do an
analysis of the prescription to ensure that the patient's medications won't
cause a harmful interaction."

Because of Quebec's aging population, technicians are also organizing
medications in pillboxes and other dispensing devices fairly often in order to
help ensure that prescriptions are followed.

Pharmacists verify the prescriptions and medications before dispensing them to
patients. "But even that is beginning to change because of the shortage of
pharmacists," Dubois said. "We're starting to see a technique now called
tech-check-tech, whereby one technician will do the preparation and another will
verify it with a pharmacist doing spot checks."

This method started in hospitals and was tested using a pilot project in
community pharmacies last year. "The results were very successful," Dubois said.
"I foresee techs getting even more responsibilities in the future, it's
necessary considering the shortage."

As is, technicians can essentially perform all of the same tasks as pharmacists
in community pharmacies except provide medical advice, Dubois added.

There are two ways to become a pharmacy technical assistant. In a community
pharmacy you can receive on-the-job training without having a certificate or
completing a course. "But you'd be limiting yourself," Dubois said. "Without a
diploma you can only work as a technician in a retail pharmacy."

With a diploma, technicians can work in several health care settings such as
hospitals, assisted living facilities, specialty pharmacies and research
facilities. "Technicians in institutions generally have high salaries as well
because they are syndicated," Dubois added.

For more information about becoming a Technical Pharmacy Assistant visit the
Association québecoise des assistant(e)s techniques en pharmacie website

Dist admin finds technical irregularities at 25 clinics

SECTION: KOLHAPUR

LENGTH: 405 words


Kolhapur: The district health administration has found technical irregularities
in 25 clinics it has inspected since March 15.The administration decided to
crack down on illegally-run hospitals and sonography centres across the centres
after the sex determination racket was exposed in Mhaisal town in Sangli
district this month.These irregularities include violation of norms regarding
the ICU and not having the required certificates and no objection certificates
(NOC) from various departments of the civic body, health administration, and the
state's directorate of health. The administration will be inspecting around 400
hospitals more. In the last two weeks, however, only 90 hospitals were
inspected.

The deadline for teams appointed for surprise visits and inspection ends on
April 15. District civil surgeon L S Patil, said, "We have found irregularities
in 25 hospitals and clinics across the district. These irregularities are mostly
related to technical issues such as failure in getting certificates for
disposing medical waste or any other provisions as mentioned in the Bombay
Nursing Act. We are yet to find any maternity clinic or sonography centre where
illegal processes are taking place. Show-cause notices have been issued to the
hospitals' doctors and we have sought a reply within a week."Inspection teams
have been formed at the taluka-level comprising a medical superintendent and
representatives from the revenue department, police and food and drugs
administration (FDA). These teams will make surprise visits. Similar teams were
formed for inspection of hospitals in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC)
limits as well as village areas. A committee has been formed at the district
level headed by the district collector. Patil said that a report regarding the
irregularities in these 25 clinics was tabled before the committee which will
soon decide the future course of action."The teams inspect the qualifications of
doctors and nursing staff operating in the clinics. Documents related to various
permissions under the Act are scrutinised and various departments such as
outpatient department (OPD), operation theatres, delivery sections, sonography
section, medical stores, laboratories and scanning department are searched. The
doctors, especially those handling pregnancy cases, have to give details of
medicines prescribed to any pregnant women," Patil said.

Hospital staff vote for strike

BYLINE: MARK SMITH

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 719 words


HOSPITAL workers caught up in a pay dispute have voted "overwhelmingly" in
favour of strike action, it has been revealed.

Dozens of staff in the sterilisation and disinfection units and the X-ray
department in hospitals run by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University (ABMU)
Health Board will stage a walk-out later this year.

It will affect services at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, Morriston
and Singleton Hospitals in Swansea, and Neath Port Talbot Hospital. Unison said
operating theatres, wards and clinics could not function without the work of
assistant technical officers (ATOs) in the hospital sterilisation and
disinfection units.

It said its members are "infuriated" their claim for pay parity with colleagues
doing the same job in other hospitals in Wales has not been taken seriously by
the health board.

It has described the vote for strike action as an indictment on the health
board's failure to tackle "historic anomalies" in their pay structure.

A spokesman said: "Since March 2014, the trade union has repeatedly put the case
for pay parity to managers including through official grievance hearings.

"Exasperation at the lack of progress has turned to anger at the stalling
tactics of the health board.

"It accepted the job description required revision 10 months ago but has failed
to honour this commitment."

In Wales, ATOs are employed on NHS Band 3 which means a starting at a wage of
£8.49 an hour and rising gradually to £10.05 after six years' service, subject
to passing annual appraisals.

But in ABMU, Unison says all ATOs are employed on NHS Band 2 which means
starting at £8.25 an hour and rising to just £9.09.

Mark Turner, Unison organiser for ABMU, said staff at the hospitals are angry
because they are being treated as "second-class citizens".

He said: "They cannot understand why their health board values their work less
than peers doing exactly the same job with the same responsibilities elsewhere
in Wales.

"There is no reason they should be paid a lower rate. People are losing out on
hundreds and hundreds of pounds every year, in some cases they are being
underpaid by nearly £2,000 a year.

"This is money that should be theirs by right. Assistant technical officers are
essential to the running of the hospital and they must be paid the rate for the
job.

"The onus now is on the health board to make an improved offer. They have seen
the intensity of workplace anger and we want them to work with us to avoid
industrial action."

When it came to the pay banding dispute of ATOs, 54 out of 56 staff within
hospital sterilisation and disinfection units voted for strike action. And all
18 members who are clerical officers within radiology departments voted in
favour of a strike.

The earliest action could take place is Wednesday, January 18, but no dates have
yet been set.

An ABMU Health Board spokesman said: "We are sorry our continuing discussions
with Unison have not been able to resolve our staff 's concerns. We would like
to make it clear that all our staff - no matter what their role within the
health board - are valued and all of them contribute equally to the care of our
patients.

"To clarify, we received notification from Unison they would be balloting those
band 2 assistant technical officers in HSDU and band 2 clerical staff in
radiology, who are members of Unison.

"There are approximately 500 staff in these departments. Of these, there are 89
band 2 Assistant Technical Officers in HSDU and 39 band 2 clerical staff in the
radiology department - not all of whom are members of Unison. We understand in
total 72 members voted in favour of strike action.

"Only in Cardiff and Vale health board where restructuring has taken place, and
Hywel Dda health board where a different service is provided, are ATOs a band 3.
We have been working with Unison to develop a new job description for ATOs and
have reached agreement on all areas apart from the necessary qualification.

"The health board is also working with the radiology department to address any
concerns staff have.

"ABMU is fully committed to continuing its partnership work with Unison to
resolve these concerns and are meeting with them early next week.

"In the meantime, we would like to reassure patients should strike action go
ahead we will be working to ensure any disruption to services are minimal."

Provincial committee to scrutinize superhospital plans: McGill planners welcome
decision to review all technical aspects of city's two projects

SOURCE: The Gazette

BYLINE: AARON DERFEL

SECTION: News; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 581 words

Montreal's two planned superhospitals will come under the microscope in the next
few weeks as a government-appointed committee reviews every technical aspect of
the billion-dollar projects.

The committee, however, does not have the mandate to question whether it makes
sense to build the superhospitals in the first place rather than renovate
existing hospitals. Together, the two sprawling facilities would represent the
biggest construction in Montreal since the 1976 Olympics.

Nicolas Steinmetz, chief planner of the McGill University superhospital, said
yesterday that he welcomes the scrutiny of the committee.

"It's kind of an outside oversight and I think that's good," Steinmetz said. He
suggested that setting up the committee was a wise move by the government to
avoid being accused of "political hanky-panky."

The provincial government, however, has not yet appointed the two co-chairpeople
of the committee or any members. The committee is supposed to start its work at
the end of the month and submit recommendations to Quebec by April. It's not
clear yet whether the committee will hold public hearings.

In July, Health Minister Philippe Couillard approved the two superhospital
projects, albeit with strict conditions. First, he said that both the McGill
University Health Centre and the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal
must set aside one existing hospital each to complement the future
superhospitals.

In the case of the McGill network, the Montreal General Hospital will probably
remain. Steinmetz said yesterday that the General will keep a 24-hour emergency
room, but it won't accept ambulances.

Notre Dame Hospital is likely to stay open after the Universite de Montreal
superhospital is built at St. Denis St., across from the Rosemont metro station.

Couillard pledged $800 million for each superhospital. He insisted the operating
budgets of the new facilities not exceed their current budgets.

Cathy Rouleau, Couillard's press attache, yesterday reiterated the minister's
concern to keep costs down.

"Yes, there is $1.6 billion for building these two hospitals, but we cannot
allow the operating costs of the new hospitals to double or triple," Rouleau
said.

In addition to provincial funding, Steinmetz said the MUHC will launch a
$200-million capital campaign and is seeking $100 million in federal aid for a
state-of-the-art research centre. That means the total price tag of the McGill
superhospital could reach $1.1 billion. The same price tag is being considered
for the CHUM superhospital.

The promoters must submit their detailed plans to the government by
mid-December. Among the issues the technical committee will examine:

The links to public transit and the road network. Traffic and pedestrian safety
will also be studied.

The impact on the environment. The MUHC intends to build its superhospital on
the site of the Glen railway yards. The cost of decontaminating that site is
about $33 million.

The distribution of hospital beds. The government has pegged the number of beds
in the future MUHC network at 832 and 1,000 for the CHUM. The number of beds for
various hospital departments like psychiatry is yet to be determined.

In addition to the technical committee, the Montreal Regional Health Board will
study the impact of the superhospitals on the delivery of medical services
across the island to make sure other hospitals are not shortchanged.

THESE ATHLETES ALWAYS WIN, REGARDLESS OF THE FINAL SCORE

BYLINE: By Charmain Z. Brackett Correspondent

SECTION: RC NEIGHBORS; Pg. O03

LENGTH: 530 words


This basketball game was a little different.

The sound of tennis shoes squeaking on the floor was replaced by the thud of
wheelchairs banging together as players went for the ball. There also were
cheers and applause, and referees' whistles.

When the final buzzer sounded ending the two-game series at Aiken Technical
College on Saturday, the Walton Bulldogs of Augusta had lost both games to the
Spartanburg (S.C.) Pistons.

This sport, however, isn't about the score at the end of a game, said Alan
Washington, who plays on the wheelchair basketball team sponsored by Walton
Rehabilitation Hospital. The team is part of the National Wheelchair Basketball
Association, South Carolina Division III.

"It's about enjoying yourself," he said.

Despite losing 47-29 and 59-27 to the Pistons, the Bulldogs will play in the
state Division III conference tournament Feb. 4-5 in Myrtle Beach, S.C.

Mr. Washington, who was injured nearly 20 years ago when a crane cradle fell on
him aboard a Navy ship, has been playing wheelchair basketball for more than 10
years. Several of his co-workers at UPS in Aiken attended Saturday's games.

Mr. Washington said sports were an important part of his life growing up.

"I played basketball in high school and ran track," he said.

Now, he also plays golf and tennis from a wheelchair.

Judie Thompson, an occupational therapist at Walton, is a coordinator for
BlazeSports America, a national sports organization for people with physical
disabilities. She said there is a growing list of sports for disabled athletes.

"Power soccer is next," she said. "Wheelchair tennis is going on on Mondays.
Golf starts up in March, and swimming is ongoing."

There's also a rugby team for disabled athletes, Ms. Thompson said.

The sports are for any adult in the area with a disability, she said. They do
not have to be patients or former patients at Walton to participate. Not all the
basketball players on the team are confined to wheelchairs, but they have other
disabling physical conditions.

"I love it," said Hephzibah's Jason Hitt, who was injured in a car accident
three years ago, of wheelchair basketball. "It keeps me active."

Keeping active also helps the disabled with their mental well-being, Ms.
Thompson said. "They don't have time to feel sorry for themselves."

It's been more than 25 years since Luer Hildebrandt was injured in a motorcycle
accident. He said he joined the basketball league to get in better physical
shape and lose some weight.

"I love it - it's all fun," said Mr. Hildebrandt, who retired after 20 years as
a civil servant at Fort Gordon.

Saturday's games were held at Aiken Tech because Knights coach Bruce Capers
invited the team to use the gym. Most of the Bulldogs' home basketball games
were held at Garrett Recreation Center this season.

Ms. Thompson said she is helping plan a sports program for the disabled that
links the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Walton.

She said the program offers activities for military personnel injured in the
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

So far, there is one soldier on the basketball team and some others in the golf
program, she said.

Affection for the tech

SECTION: Features; Nostalgia; Localpeople; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 188 words


Sir, - You showed a picture of the old Haywood Hospital in Moorland Road,
Burslem (March 19) and described it as the temporary home of Stanfields
Technical High School.  It would have been better described as the former home.
The former Haywood Hospital was opened in 1932 as the Junior Technical School of
Stoke-on-Trent and was well equipped with workshops for woodwork and metalwork,
laboratories for chemistry, science and mechanics, two drawing offices, a
geography room and four general classrooms.

Student selection was made at 13-plus by written test and interview.  The
headmaster, James A Collinson, interviewed all the new entrants before they
could be accepted. Myself and my four brothers all gained entrance and on
leaving obtained employment in engineering.

When it was decided to rebuild the school in the 1940s it was moved to High Lane
and became Stanfields High School.  The metalwork shops remained at Moorland
Road until the 1950s. The entry became 11-plus.

Many engineers in Staffordshire have cause to remember the old Junior Tech with
respect and affection.
