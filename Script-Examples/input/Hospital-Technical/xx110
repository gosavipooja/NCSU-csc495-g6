Gardai who are investigating the discovery of the body of a newborn baby boy in
a house near Dunmanway in west Cork are awaiting the results of a post-mortem
today to try and establish if the baby was stillborn.

Officers were alerted after the parents of a young woman discovered the
decomposed body wrapped in clothing in an annexe off a bathroom in their house
in the area at about lunchtime yesterday.

Garda technical experts sealed off the house and carried out a preliminary
examination of the scene.

Following consultation with the Garda Technical Bureau in Dublin, they requested
the services of the Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster.

Dr Bolster carried out a preliminary examination of the body at the scene before
it was removed to Cork University Hospital where she will carry out a full
post-mortem today.

Detectives believe the body was in the house for over a week as the woman who
they believe is its mother checked into hospital a week ago for psychiatric
treatment.

The woman's parents were shocked by the discovery and were being comforted by
relatives yesterday.

"They're in a terrible state. They had no idea that their daughter was pregnant
and they're very worried and concerned about her welfare," said a local source.

A Garda spokesman said: "We are handling the matter with great sensitivity given
its delicate nature and our desire to protect the privacy of the family and the
woman at the centre of this sad and tragic case."
