Also unnoticed

LENGTH: 271 words


PROFESSOR R. Beal in his letter "Unnoticed" (The Advertiser, 13/1/94) did not go
far enough in expressing his gratitude for the health service provided during
the Christmas period.

Not only do a few hundred hospital scientists and pathology technical staff go
unnoticed but also unheard and unrewarded. The public should be told that
donated blood cannot be released for use until thoroughly tested by Red Cross
technical and scientific staff.

Nor can blood be transfused (unless an extreme emergency) before tranfusion
staff perform compatibility testing in SA's major hospitals. This is to avoid
transfusion reactions.

Hospital scientists and the technical staff under their direction are the silent
providers of accurate patient specific information in the pathology areas of
microbiology, haematology, chemistry and histopathology.

It is this information on which the doctors rely in order to make approriate
clinical decisions. Without such information, we, the public would not only
observe but also experience a far more ineffective and inefficient health
system.

The research undertaken by hospital scientists in our major hospitals today will
directly enhance the provision of a service of excellence tomorrow.

However, no one hears of these tireless, dedicated scientists, who the
Department of Labor denies recognising with an appropriate award, because they
get on with supporting the quality of life we all expect.

Not only should we praise and support donors of a scarce resource, doctors and
nurses but also all those involved in providing patient care 365 days of the
year.

M. SMITH, Modbury.
