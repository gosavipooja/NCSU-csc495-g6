Six hospitals left without repair service

Six hospitals in the control of the North Eastern Health Board have been left
without an out-of-hours electrical and mechanical repair service, following an
industrial dispute, writes Tim O'Brien.

The hospitals at Monaghan, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee and Navan have been
told by members of the Technical, Electrical and Engineering Union that the
health board is unwilling to adhere to an agreement for cover signed last April.

In November the union told the board that service would be withdrawn unless
payments, which it insists amount to E150 for all six hospitals in total per
week, were met.

The union provided a deadline of December 20th for resolution of the service
which the union's regional secretary, Mr Arthur Hall, said was the same contract
worked by all other health boards.

He said that since the deadline had passed one intensive care unit monitor had
ceased to work, and staff in Monaghan Hospital were being drafted in to wash
dishes following the breakdown of the hospital's dishwashers. A spokesman for
the health board was not available yesterday.
