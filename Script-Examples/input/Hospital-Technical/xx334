A LEADER in East New Britain Province has called on authorities to speed up the
relocation of Nonga General Hospital due to the continuous ash fall from
volcanic Mt Tavurvur.

Toma/Vunadidir Local Level Government president David Piamia also questioned
when a technical team would be established in the province to organise the
relocation of the hospital.

An initial funding of K9 million had been made available for the relocation of
the hospital to the Toma/Vunadidir LLG area under the National Government s
Supplementary Budget.

The ENB provincial executive council had made the decision some years ago to
relocate the hospital due to the continuous spewing of ash and dust from Mt
Tavurvur.

The hospital has been subjected to corrosion and rust.

It is costly to maintain and the present location was also regarded as risky for
patients.

The ENB Health adviser Bernard Lukara had said they were still waiting for a
technical task force at the Department of Health level to be set up.

Mr Piamia said his people were ready to sell their land to the provincial
government for the building of the hospital.

He called on the Health Minister Sasa Zibe and his secretary to immediately set
up a technical team so work could start.
