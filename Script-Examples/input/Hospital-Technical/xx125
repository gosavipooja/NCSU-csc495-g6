SECTION: Vol. XXXV No. 44

LENGTH: 184  words


Over 204 posts of doctors and other technical staff have been vacant in Sir
Ganga Ram Hospital for many years. Sources said 56 vacant posts were related to
medical cadre of emergency ward including surgeons, physicians, pathologists,
anaesthetists and radiologists of BPS-18 to 19.  Some 21 posts of nurses of
BPS-16 are also vacant in the hospital.

Similarly, over 177 posts of technical staff including SDO, Xen, bio-medical
engineer, statistical officer, public relations officer, AC technician,
laboratory assistant, computer operator, electrician, generator operator,
plumber, welder, naib qasid and sweeper of BPS-01 to BPS-18 have been vacant in
the hospital for the last three years.

Officials concerned of the Health Department said the posts could not be filled
due to a ban after last year's devastating floods.

The posts were also advertised in newspapers in July 2010 but recruitment was
delayed due to floods.

Some 39 posts of technical cadre are being filled soon and they were advertised
in newspapers on January 31, 2011, as there is no ban on appointment of
technical staff in hospitals.
