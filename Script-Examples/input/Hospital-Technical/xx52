'BURGLAR' RIDDLE IN DEATH OF MAN, 68

BYLINE: Vanessa Conneely

LENGTH: 239 words


A BLOOD-spattered old man has been found dead under a toppled bedroom wardrobe
sparking fears he was the victim of a bungled burglary.

Cops say the death of the unnamed pensioner - whose Cork city bungalow has been
raided several times in recent years - is suspicious.

The grim find came around midday yesterday after a Meals On Wheels volunteer got
no reply to her knock on the door.

Shaken neighbour Ann Herlihy, who found the 68-year-old's body after letting the
volunteer in, said: "We knocked, but when he didn't answer I opened the door and
went in and found him.

"He had a wardrobe on top of him and blood on the side of his arm."

Quiet

Locals in Togher have told gardai they spotted a young stranger hanging around
the area late on Monday.

Neighbour Kathleen Sheehan said: "I saw a young boy going in around the back of
the house but I didn't know who it was."

She described the dead man, who had lived alone in the bungalow for over three
years, as a quiet person who kept to himself.

His body was taken to Cork University Hospital for a post mortem examination.

A Garda source said: "We are carrying out a full investigation and are treating
the death as suspicious until we find out more details.

"The area has been sealed off and Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret
Bolster and members of the Garda Technical Bureau are at the scene to carry out
a technical examination."
