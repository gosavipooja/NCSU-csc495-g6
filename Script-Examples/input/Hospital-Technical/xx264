Hospital insists it is 'fire-safe'

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 255 words


Health board bosses have reassured anyone using the Queen Elizabeth University
Hospital that it is"one of the most fire-safe buildings in the country".

The move to boost public reassurance comes after NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde
brought in external technical advisers to give advice on fire safety.

This follows concerns arising about external cladding as a result of the
GrenfellTower fire in London that killed around 80 people in June.

A health board spokeswoman said:"As part of these further forensic checks, we
have identified a type of aluminium composite material on parts of the Queen
Elizabeth University Hospital of a similar type to, but not the same as,
Grenfell.

"Health Facilities Scotland and their national fire advisor have given us
renewed assurances that the hospital is an extremely safe building.

"The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has also provided further reassurance
that, as part of its regular risk based audit programme, it had carried out fire
safety audits within the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, which were found
to be satisfactory.

"As a purely precautionary measure, and to make sure the public, our patients
and our staff have full confidence in the safety of the hospital we have taken
the decision to remove the panels from the areas of the hospital affected.

"The panels that will be removed are present in three external sections of the
building and we are currently working with contractors and technical advisers to
assess how this work can proceed at the earliest possible opportunity."
