HIGHLIGHT: SUPPORT: MSP Sheridan


TOMMY Sheridan MSP has attacked health union bosses for not backing striking
hospital workers.

Mr Sheridan, Scottish Socialist member for Glasgow, met Unison staff and Fire
Brigades Union members.

Full-time NHS clerical and ancillary staff earn pounds 11,000-a-year after 15
years, while firefighters earn a maximum of pounds 21,300 after five years'
training.

The MSP tabled a motion calling on the Scottish Parliament to listen to their
pay claims.

He then blasted Unison boss Matt Smith saying: "Your lowest paid members have
been on unofficial strike without pay for two weeks and are deserving of your
support."

Last night NHS technical support staff were considering industrial action in
five Glasgow hospitals over a bid to push hourly pay from pounds 4.84 to pounds
6.02.

Staff at Vale of Leven Hospital, Alexandria, want bosses to solve a staff
shortage.
