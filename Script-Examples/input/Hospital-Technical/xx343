LOTS OF BOUNCE FOR BABIES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 154 words


STUDENTS who bounced to raise money for Walsgrave Hospital's special baby care
unit have promised that their cheque won't do the same.

Twelve second-year nursery nurse students along with members of staff from
Coventry Technical College in the Butts, Earlsdon, spent seven hours jumping up
and down on a bouncy castle yesterday.

The teenagers were asked to organise a fund-raising event as part of their
coursework, and devised the bounce-a-thon because they felt a sponsored walk
would be "too boring."

Student Sue Cowley said: "We hope to raise as much money as possible.

"We all took turns on the castle throughout the day but we promise the cheque
won't bounce as well!"

Course tutor Sharon Broer said: "Everyone was messing around and having a lovely
time, although the ground did feel very strange afterwards."

The students hope to present a cheque to hospital staff in the next two weeks.
