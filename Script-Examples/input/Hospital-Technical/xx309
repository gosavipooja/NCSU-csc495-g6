Bouygues secures contract to build two buildings at Hautepierre Hospital in
France

LENGTH: 256 words


To be designed by Ingerop and developed by Groupe 6, the project includes
construction of two buildings, out of which one will be a regional cancer
institute and the other a medico-technical and locomotor facility.

Both the buildings will be connected to each other and to an existing structure
through underground passages and pedestrian bridges.

Occupying a surface area of 30,000m², the eight-storey regional cancer institute
will house a radiotherapy unit equipped with seven bunkers for particle
accelerators, a nuclear medicine unit, a 122-bed conventional hospital block, a
38-bed specialist hospital unit, and 72-bed oncology and haematology day
hospitals.

The 11-floor medico-technical and locomotor facility will be built on an area of
around 41,000m².

This building will feature an arrivals area, logistical platform, a central
sterilization unit, a 164-seat lecture theatre equipped with conference rooms,
an area for external consultations in disciplines not covered at the facility,
and an extension of the site's imaging unit.

Also, two surgical units with 15 and 17 theatres respectively, a 30-bed
day-surgery hospital, a continuous monitoring unit with 16 beds, six
conventional hospital units each with 28 beds, and associated offices and
support services will be available at the facility.

Pertuy Construction will oversee structural work, walls and covering, drywall,
finishing work, roadways and infrastructural networks.

Work on the site is slated to begin in early July 2014 and is expected to take
42 months to complete.
