Gauhati Medical College and Hospital to repair snags in ICUs

SECTION: GUWAHATI

LENGTH: 228 words


GUWAHATI: Two days after a fire broke out in the neo-natal intensive care unit
(NICU) of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), the hospital authorities
have instructed the PWD (electrical division) to do a thorough survey of the
ICUs in the hospital and repair all defects and technical snags as soon as
possible.

Kabul Saikia, principal of GMCH said, "Besides setting up a three-member enquiry
committee on the fire incident on Friday, we have also engaged the PWD executive
engineer to check the status of other technical snags in the hospital and repair
the same."

"We will also conduct a special audit where we will find out how many areas in
the hospital need technical renovation and we are planning to inform the
government about the total budget required for any kind of renovation," he said.
Saikia said, "As of now, the hospital has over 500 fire extinguishers installed
in different parts of the hospital and we also have trained officials and
hospital staff to tackle such emergencies."

"It is a 45 year-old hospital, so we do not have advanced facilities for fire
safety. But, we will now install all modern equipments required, but it will
take time. There was a fire in one of the hospitals in Kolkata, where many
patients lost their lives. We are taking caution so that nothing unfortunate
happens here," he added.
