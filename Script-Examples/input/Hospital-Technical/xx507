Affection for the tech

Sir, - You showed a picture of the old Haywood Hospital in Moorland Road,
Burslem (March 19) and described it as the temporary home of Stanfields
Technical High School.  It would have been better described as the former home.
The former Haywood Hospital was opened in 1932 as the Junior Technical School of
Stoke-on-Trent and was well equipped with workshops for woodwork and metalwork,
laboratories for chemistry, science and mechanics, two drawing offices, a
geography room and four general classrooms.

Student selection was made at 13-plus by written test and interview.  The
headmaster, James A Collinson, interviewed all the new entrants before they
could be accepted. Myself and my four brothers all gained entrance and on
leaving obtained employment in engineering.

When it was decided to rebuild the school in the 1940s it was moved to High Lane
and became Stanfields High School.  The metalwork shops remained at Moorland
Road until the 1950s. The entry became 11-plus.

Many engineers in Staffordshire have cause to remember the old Junior Tech with
respect and affection.
