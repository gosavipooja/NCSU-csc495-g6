A £3.6million school based on a campus at Torbay Hospital opens its doors to
students for the first time today.

Devon Studio School will welcome Year 10 students today for their induction.

Tomorrow sixth form students will start.

All lessons for students taking part at the vocational school then start on
Tuesday. The school, which will take up to 300 pupils and employ 35 full time
staff, opens with around 90 pupils on the main hospital site.

South Devon College, together with the trust which runs the hospital, won
funding from the Department of Education for the project.

The new school will teach 14 to 19 year olds GCSEs and A-levels alongside
technical and vocational qualifications in health, social care and early years'
paediatric nursing and health visiting. ¦ SEE Page 18 for South Devon College's
new university technical college plan for Newton Abbot.
