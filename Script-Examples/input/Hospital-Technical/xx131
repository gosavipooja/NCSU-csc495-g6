LAHORE, Feb. 15 -- Over 204 posts of doctors and other

for many years.

Sources said 56 vacant posts were related to medical cadre of

emergency ward including surgeons, physicians,

pathologists, anaesthetists and radiologists of BPS-18 to 19.

Some 21 posts of nurses of BPS-16 are also vacant

in the hospital.

relations officer, AC technician, laboratory assistant,

computer operator, electrician, generator operator,

plumber, welder, naib qasid and sweeper of BPS-01 to

BPS-18 have been vacant in the hospital for the last three

years.

Officials concerned of the Health Department said

the posts could not be filled due to a ban after last year's

devastating floods.

The posts were also advertised in newspapers

in July 2010 but recruitment was delayed due to floods.

Some 39 posts of technical cadre are

being filled soon and they were advertised

in newspapers on January 31, 2011, as there is no ban on
