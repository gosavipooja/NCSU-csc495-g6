Non-medical staff returned to work yesterday at Waterford Regional Hospital
after the settlement of their 10-day strike.

The original dispute involving the TEEU (Technical Engineering Electrical Union)
was settled on Tuesday but more than 200 members of the ATGWU, including
caterers, cleaners and porters, placed unofficial pickets at the hospital on
Wednesday.

They were demanding the reinstatement of a cleaning company whose contract with
the board had been suspended during the original strike.
