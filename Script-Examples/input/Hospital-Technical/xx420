June 11--Nurses and technical professionals unions have ratified contracts with
ACMH Hospital in East Franklin.

The Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses & Allied Professionals represents
420 employees at ACMH.

The nurses contract is a one-year extension that expires in September 2017.

The technical professionals and LPN contract is for two years and expires in
March 2018, ACMH spokeswoman Anne Remaley said.

This is the first contract for the tech professionals and LPNs, who organized in
2014, according to a news release from the union.

Their contract provides a 2 percent wage increase in January. The LPNs and
technical professionals will receive a $400 ratification bonus, an increase in
the employer contribution to the retirement plan and a continuation of longevity
bonuses ranging from $300 to $2,000, based on years of service.

The registered nurses contract includes a 2.25 percent wage increase. That group
will now be permitted to use a $2,000 annual education benefit to pay for
continuing education requirements instead of just college course reimbursement.

Health care costs in both contracts remain low and include a slight deductible
increase, according to the union.

Because both contracts expire within four months of each other, the groups plan
to collaborate in bargaining for their next contract, the union release said.
