Sindh Government Qatar Hospital Karachi's expansive robotic surgery machine is
lying non-functional for couple of years after developing a 'technical fault' as
despite various request by the hospital administration to Sindh Health
Department required funds could not be released for the maintenance of machine.

The advanced robotic surgery machine was installed in the hospital in 2011.
Around 70 successful surgeries were performed from 2011 to 2014 in the hospital
but later the surgeries through robotic machine could not be performed due to
some technical fault and management failure to get it repaired. However,
according to Medical Superintendent, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Orangi
Town, Dr Syed Khalid Masood robotic surgery machine could not be repaired due to
shortage of funds.

"Rs 40 million is urgently needed for repairing robotic machine and the hospital
administration had sent a request to Sindh health department for release of
funds to get this machine repaired," Dr Masood said.

The major advantages of robotic surgery are precision, miniaturization, smaller
incisions, decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. The cost
of per surgery on this machine is in millions at private hospitals but Qatar
Hospital was performing all surgeries free of cost before this new machine got
the 'mysterious technical fault', Dr Masood added.
