Srinagar, Sept. 21 -- After the contractual lecturers and government employees,
the Hospital Development Fund (HDF) employees too faced the police wrath as they
were cane charged during their protests on Tuesday.

Raising slogans and carrying banner, the All Jammu and Kashmir Technical and
Non-technical HDF employees took out a protest rally at the Press Enclave area
demanding fulfillment of their long pending demands. However, the protestors
were cane charged by the police when they tried to march further towards Lal
Chowk.

The protestors claimed that a dozen union members got injured during the
incident. "We were not protesting with stones in our hands. Ours was a peaceful
protest and there was no justification for the police action against us. Four of
our colleagues were also detained," said Tariq Ahmed, a protestor.

consist of more than 150 employees, who work at different hospitals of Kashmir
valley. They were demanding increase in their monthly remunerations and
