14 KIDS IN HOSPITAL AFTER POPPING PILLS

    Lad hands them out at school

    FOURTEEN teenagers were rushed to hospital after popping sleeping pills at
school.

    One lad swiped the tablets from his parents and handed them around to his
mates.

    The youngsters, aged 14 and 15, fell ill at home after classes ended for the
day. Anxious parents took them to hospital - and police were called in.

    The drama at Norham Community Technical College in North Shields, Tyneside,
came just a week after seven youngsters from a nearby estate nearly died through
swallowing a drink and drugs cocktail.

    The 14 from Norham College were all released from hospital within hours.

    But police said it could have been "an extremely serious incident".

    Suffer

    Chief Inspector Derek Scott added: "We took some calls in the evening and by
that time the youngsters had begun to suffer the effects of taking the tablets.

    "We are obviously very concerned that 14 youngsters ended up in hospital.
Although the drugs were fairly mild, they were not to know that."

    A local council spokesman said health and drug experts have contacted the
school to offer advice and support.

    Last week seven youths in Wallsend were taken to hospital after taking
cannabis, tranquilisers, sleeping pills and booze.

    They collapsed but were all released after treatment.

    Three youths have been arrested in connection with the supply of the drugs.
