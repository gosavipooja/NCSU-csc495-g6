Hospital maintenance and technical staff are stunned by Canterbury District
Health Board (CDHB) proposals to axe one in eight jobs from the service.

The board yesterday asked staff and trade unions to comment on draft proposals
for changing the way maintenance and technical services were delivered to
hospitals.

Support manager Murray Dickson said each hospital site operated independently
using a total of 95 maintenance and technical staff including electricians,
fitters, plumbers, carpenters, painters, gardeners and trades assistants,
engineers and other technical personnel.

Dickson said one proposal would see some external maintenance work in-house
while another would introduce a more centralised structure across all hospitals
leading to job cuts, mostly in management.

The National Union for Public Employees said staff were stunned by the proposals
and feared more than 12 jobs could go.
