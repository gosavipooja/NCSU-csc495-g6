   Police are to make a series of visits to schools in North Tyneside to warn
pupils of the danger of drugs.

It comes after the area was rocked by two drugs scandals within a week involving
children.

Fourteen youngsters aged 14 and 15 at Norham Community Technical College in
North Shields needed hospital treatment after taking sleeping pills which were
taken from a medicine cabinet.

Seven youths from nearby Wallsend collapsed and were taken to hospital after a
drink and drugs binge a week ago.

Police said today they were treating the latest incident as 'extremely serious'.
They are to send officers into schools in the area to urge teenagers to stay
away from drugs.

Chief Insp Derek Scott of North Shields police said: "We are obviously concerned
that 14 youngsters ended up in hospital. Although the drugs were fairly mild,
they were not to know that.

"Officers are going to the school to provide drug education advice to avoid a
similar situation arising again."
