LENGTH: 194 words


A teenage model-maker lost three fingers after a 'crude experiment' went wrong
in his bedroom yesterday.

The college student had been building a propulsion unit for his model boat using
match heads when it exploded, blowing three fingers off his left hand.

The youth, who has not been named, was at his parents' home in Darlington, Co
Durham, when the accident happened.

The boy, thought to be 16 or 17, and a student at Darlington Technical College,
was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital and then transferred to
Middlesbrough's James Cook Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for
injuries and burns to his hand.

A Durham Police spokesman said: 'A young model-making enthusiast was badly hurt
when a crude experiment went wrong.

'The teenager, who is not being identified, was working in a bedroom at his
parents' home when there was an explosion that blew three fingers off his left
hand.

'Police called to the house said he had been building a propulsion unit for his
model boat using a carbon dioxide canister.

'He was filling a container with sulphur recovered from the heads of matches
when the explosion occurred.'
