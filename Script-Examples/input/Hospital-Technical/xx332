   Emergent Group Inc. (Emergent) is the parent company of PRI Medical
Technologies, Inc., its wholly owned and primary operating subsidiary (PRI
Medical). PRI Medical is a provider of surgical equipment on a fee for service
basis to hospitals, surgical care centers and other healthcare providers. PRI
Medical serves both large and small healthcare providers, including smaller
independent hospitals and physicians, and larger, well-financed hospitals. PRI
Medical also provides its technicians to support hospital-owned surgical
equipment on a fee for service basis. In May 2009, the Company acquired New York
Cryosurgery Equipment LLC, which provides mobile cryosurgery equipment and
technicians to hospitals for treatment of prostate and renal cancer.

   PRI Medical makes mobile surgical services available to its customers by
providing mobile lasers and other surgical equipment on a per procedure basis to
hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, and physician offices along with
technical support and disposable supplies required to utilize the equipment. PRI
Medical' s mobile surgical services focus on primarily surgical care. Physicians
perform surgeries at hospitals or surgery centers by renting PRI Medical' s
laser or other equipment and receive PRI Medical' s technical support and
capabilities that is provided with the equipment. As of December 31, 2009, PRI
Medical had approximately 800 active accounts in 16 states. The market
encompasses many disciplines, including general surgery, orthopedic surgery,
otolaryngology, urology, obstetrics, gynecology, podiatry, dermatology, and
plastic/cosmetics. It has acquired the assets of Surgical Services Division (the
Services Division) of PhotoMedex, Inc. The Services Division provides mobile
laser services in 11 Northeast, Middle Atlantic and Southeast states, serving 18
individual local markets, expanding PRI' s geographic coverage to a total of 16
states.

   PRI Medical' s technicians provide surgical equipment and related technical
services support to physicians and operating room personnel in hospitals,
surgical care centers and other health-related facilities on a per-procedure
basis. Mobile surgical services are ordered from 24 hours to several months in
advance of surgery, and re-confirmed with the customer the day before the
medical procedure by PRI Medical' s scheduling department. Upon arrival at the
customer site, PRI Medical' s technician set up the equipment, posts required
warning notices outside the operating room, issues safety equipment to the
operating room staff, provides any disposable materials needed, and supplies
equipment certifications and/or documentation required for hospital record
keeping. Technician-only services are also made available to hospitals and
surgery facilities.

   PRI Medical' s equipment encompasses carbon dioxide (CO2), neodymium yttrium
aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), pulse dye, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)/YAG,
diode, Greenlight HPS, holmium YAG, lithotripsy and cryosurgery technology. PRI
Medical also provides its customers with disposable products and/or ancillary
equipment that are needed for a given medical procedure. The revenue from
disposable products is primarily related to laser and cryosurgery equipment
rentals requiring fibers, probes, and disposable kits proprietary to a specific
manufacturer' s equipment.

   The Company competes with Healthtronics.
