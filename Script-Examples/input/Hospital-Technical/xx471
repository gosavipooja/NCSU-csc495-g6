   BONN - Man's sense of humor is located in the right half of the brain which
is specializing in the psychosomatic-intuitive processing of information.

This is not because of this side's allegedly greater emotionality, but because
the left, analytical-logical side of the brain has no feeling for the
absurdities or double entendres contained in the point of a joke.

Dr. Manfred Dagge and Prof. Wolfgang Hartje of the neurological department at
Aachen Technical University Hospital conducted experiments with patients who had
suffered damage to the right side of the brain following a stroke. Both patients
and control persons were presented with a cartoon and three similar but
pointless drawings. The patients were unable to determine which drawing was
humorous far more frequently than normal persons or patients whose left side of
the brain was damaged.

It was obvious that this inability to realize humorous situations did not stem
from reduced emotionality because once a cartoon had been identified as funny
they found them just as amusing as the other test persons did. The American
psychologist Paul E. McGhee concludes from similar experiments that the left
side of the brain doggedly follows and develops a straight line of thought.
