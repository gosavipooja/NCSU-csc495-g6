Guatemala : GU-T1182 : TC Intra Hospital Management Knowledge transfer Project

LENGTH: 280  words


With the aim of contributing to the development of the country, the Bank
approved a Technical Cooperation - Strengthening Management of Roosevelt
Hospital (GU-T1170), which is intended to support the Ministry of Public Health
and Social Assistance in the design, development and implementation of
management tools and skills to better manage the supply chain of its hospital
network. The initiative "Knowledge for Results", which acts as a frame for the
CT, aims to identify, organize and articulate a knowledge network with
organizations that are willing to contribute to projects, at "zero cost" and
assume the responsibility to share their knowledge, experience and best
practices. In this sense, there has been a strategic alliance with the Hospital
General de Medellín, Luz Castro de Gutiérrez E.S.E of Colombia, a high
complexity public hospital, which features renowned national and international
level.To take advantage of the knowledge of the Hospital General de Medellín,
the Minister of Finance, in his capacity of Governor of the Republic of
Guatemala to the IDB, has requested the Bank a non-reimbursable intra-regional
technical cooperation to provide financing to a mission of four officials who
will travel to Colombia in order to understanding in detail the operation of the
Medellín hospital and take the best practices that can be implemented at
Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala.
