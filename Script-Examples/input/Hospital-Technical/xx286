Lack of female technical staff in X-Ray departments , a perpetual sources of
nuisance for female patients

SECTION: Vol. 09 No. 198

LENGTH: 199  words


Lack of female technical staff in X-Ray departments in all allied hospitals at
Rawalpindi has caused embarrassment among female patients.

According to media reports, women are forced to undergo X-RAY tests in the
presence of male technical staff in all the three allied hospitals and this
state of affairs has given rise to reports of their harassment at the hands of
male technicians.

In  Benazir hospital, Holy family hospital and DHQ hospital Rawalpindi the ratio
of female staff stands next to nil. It has become a custom that no female
technician is employed and if any one is appointed she is not deputed in X-Ray
department. Due to this situation, the incidents of teasing and harassing the
female patients by male staff are on rise. If any female patient lodges
complaint against any male technician the matter is hushed up.

The poor female patients are forced to undergo X-Ray test in private
laboratories at inflated fee.

The citizens have demanded of chief minister Punjab to take notice of this
alarming situation and order for appointment of female technicians and if they
are not available then female helpers to stem growing incidents of harassment
and indecency in the allied hospitals.
