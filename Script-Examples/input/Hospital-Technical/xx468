   Medical Resources Management, Inc., incorporated in 1991, makes mobile
laser/surgical services available to its customers by providing this equipment
on a per-procedure basis to hospitals, outpatient surgery centers and
physicians' offices. The Company provides these mobile lasers with technical
support to ensure the lasers are working correctly for the physicians. The
Company also provides other medical equipment on a rental basis to hospitals and
surgery centers. This equipment is used throughout these facilities to
supplement their requirement for certain medical equipment. The Company's
largest wholly owned operating subsidiary, Physiologic Reps, Inc. (PRI),
produces approximately 82% and 75% of the Company's consolidated revenues during
the fiscal years ended October 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In July 2001,
the Company was acquired by Emergent Group Inc., a New York-based merchant
banking firm.

   The Company's laser/surgical services focus on two of the most rapidly
growing areas of the healthcare industry, managed care and cosmetic surgery. For
managed care, minimally invasive procedures can be performed by physicians at
hospitals that rent its laser equipment. For cosmetic surgery, by renting the
Company's equipment, the physicians benefit from having a multitude of different
laser technologies available to offer to their patients without the burden of
investing a significant amount of money. In both instances, physicians and
hospitals receive technical support and expertise provided with the equipment,
allowing the staff to concentrate on their duties without the additional tasks
of running a laser.

   Medical Resources Management has approximately 600 active surgical service
accounts in California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado and Nevada, and experiences a
high rate of repeat business from the hospitals, surgery centers and doctors it
serves. The market encompasses many disciplines including plastic/cosmetic
surgery, dermatology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, urology, obstetrics,
gynecology, ophthalmology, general surgery, podiatry and dentistry. Equipment is
becoming more specialized to the medical procedures involved and technical
training of the physician, regarding the use of equipment, is a significant part
of the Company's business.

   The Company's technicians deliver equipment and provide technical support to
physicians and operating room (O.R.) personnel, as needed. Once its technician
is at the customer site, he or she posts required warning notices outside the
O.R., issues safety equipment to the O.R. staff, provides any disposable
materials needed and supplies equipment certifications or documentation required
for hospital record-keeping. The Company's technician sets the physician's
requested power settings and maintains a laser-safe environment during the
surgical procedure. More than 60% of the Company's revenue was generated from
the rental of technician-supported equipment (including related disposable
sales) during each of the last two fiscal years.

   The Company's lasers encompass the latest technology in CO2, Nd:YAG, Pulse
Dye, KTP/YAG and Holmium YAG models. The Company has established a working
relationship with laser manufacturers, receives new laser technology in its
markets and is constantly reviewing developments in the medical laser field to
stay aware of the latest technology available.

   Medical Resources Management also provides its customers with disposable
products and/or attachments that are needed for a given procedure. This applies
primarily to laser-related rentals requiring laser drapes, masks, fibers and
tubing. The customers benefit from this added service since they save the added
costs that would be incurred if they had to purchase a large inventory of these
disposable products.

   Additionally, the Company offers a broad spectrum of general medical
equipment to the medical market that it serves. Its inventory of equipment
includes an extensive selection of devices, serving a broad range of hospital
departments and needs such as adult and infant ventilators, CO2 monitors,
defibrillators, feeding pumps, PCA pumps, ECG monitors, infusion pumps,
neo-natal monitors and pulse oximeters. Due in part to its varied inventory of
equipment, the Company is usually capable of offering delivery and support of
rental items with only a few hours' notice. Mobile laser/surgical services are
ordered in advance and re-confirmed with the customer the day before the
procedure by the scheduling department.
