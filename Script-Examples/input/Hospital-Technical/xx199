A MAMMOTH fitness and weight training session was held at a Coventry leisure
centre to raise money for the children's ward at the city's Walsgrave Hospital.

Childcare students from Coventry Technical College, in Butts, had to organise
the six-hour slog as part of their NVQ studies.

They are still collecting the sponsorship cash but hope to end up with more than
pounds 500 in total.

Neil Bates, of Fitness First in Cannon Park, said: "There were 11 of them doing
aerobics, step and weights for six hours."

Club members also joined in last week's event and pledged money.
