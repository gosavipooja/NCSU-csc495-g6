Health care helpers: 1st batch graduate

                                  May 24, 1993


THE first batch of certified health care assistants received their Institute of
Technical Education certificates yesterday.

For most of the 90, it was the end of a grind which saw them alternate between
looking after the sick and classroom activity for more than a year.

They will now work in private clinics or hospitals, and as medics with the
Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).

Dr Cheong Pak Yean, chairman of Healthcare Training Advisory Committee, ITE,
said: "The health care assistants will take over some of the duties of
registered nurses.

"This will enable the nurses to concentrate on their professional tasks."

At hospital level, the assistants will carry out duties such as bathing the
bedridden, attending to patients and taking a patient's height, weight,
temperature, and pulse and respiration rate.

They will act as receptionists, dispensers and laboratory technicians at private
clinics.

Many of the assistants, who received their certificates yesterday at the
Association of Private Medical Practitioners' annual dinner, are in their 30s
and have been in the nursing line for many years.

As part of their training, they spent 96 hours in the classroom and also
underwent supervised field training at their workplaces.

After this, they sat for a series of examinations which ended with the final ITE
test.
