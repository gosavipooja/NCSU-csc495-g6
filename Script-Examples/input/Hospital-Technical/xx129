Student hit by car dies

                                 June 17, 1999


A 17-YEAR-OLD Institute of Technical Education student was knocked down by a car
when she was on her way to meet friends.

She died in hospital a day later.

Miss Goh Swee Teng suffered serious head injuries in the accident that happened
on Wednesday and went into a coma.

She was taken to Changi General Hospital first and transferred to Tan Tock Seng
Hospital later that same day.

The accident happened at about 10.50 am along Pasir Ris Drive 1, near Parksville
Primary, said the police.

The teenager had planned an outing with her friends the day that the accident
happened.

The car that hit her was driven by a 28-year-old site foreman.

Her father, Mr Goh Jing Jin, 46, a cleaning contractor, said in Mandarin: "Her
head became very swollen.

"We were praying that she would regain consciousness, but she never did."

Miss Goh's mother, Madam Yang Qin Ying, 42, was too distraught to talk about her
daughter.

Eyewitnesses should call the Traffic Police on 221-0000.
