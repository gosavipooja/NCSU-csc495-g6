TWO Melbourne hospital workers are being investigated as part of a major
national crackdown on child pornography.

The pair, a technical worker at the Royal Children's Hospital and a Royal
Women's Hospital neonatal nurse, are among 82 Victorians being investigated.

The RCH yesterday confirmed a worker in a "technical role" was on indefinite
paid leave.

A computer has been seized from his home.

Hospital spokeswoman Jule Webber said young patients had never been at risk.
"He's never had any unsupervised contact with children at the hospital," she
said.

A male nurse in the Royal Women's hospital's neonatal ward has been charged.

A hospital spokeswoman said he had been stood down, but he was always supervised
and there was no evidence of any inappropriate conduct there.
