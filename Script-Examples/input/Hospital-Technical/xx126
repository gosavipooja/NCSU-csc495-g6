Two men have been released without charge by Limerick gardai investigating a
fatal stabbing in the city on Monday night. Mr Edward Waters (20) was stabbed
several times in the shoulder and chest during a dispute with two young men. He
was pronounced dead at 10.30 p.m. on Monday at Limerick Regional Hospital.

Two men, aged 17 and 20, were held for questioning under Section Four of the
Criminal Justice Act, 1984. On their release yesterday, gardai indicated they
would be preparing a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The stabbing took place in a corporation house at Clarina Park, Ballinacurra
Weston. The victim previously lived in St Colmcille Street, St Mary's Park. He
was the father of two children and had recently moved to the Ballinacurra Weston
area.

A neighbour alerted the emergency services, who in turn informed the Garda of
the incident. The State pathologist, Dr John Harbison, was to carry out a
postmortem examination yesterday after his examination of the body of Mrs Eileen
Costello O'Shaughnessy at University College Galway Hospital.

The technical support team from the Garda Technical Bureau in Dublin was also at
the scene.
