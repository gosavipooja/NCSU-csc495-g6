Technical failure causes QA delay to radiotherapy

LENGTH: 138  words


PATIENTS needing radiotherapy are facing delays at Queen Alexandra Hospital due
to a high number' of technical failures.

Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Cosham, released a
statement after months of problems.

Radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy radiation and commonly used to
treat cancer.

The statement said: We have been experiencing an unusually high number of
technical failures with our radiotherapy machines for the last couple of months
but we are working hard with our contractors to resolve issues.

We already have a programme of repairs and scheduled maintenance under way.

We are trying to minimise disruption to patients by extending clinic times,
staff working longer shifts and bringing in extra staff.'
