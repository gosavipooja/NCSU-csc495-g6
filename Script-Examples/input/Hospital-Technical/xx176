Four extra holes were drilled as part of the preliminary geo-technical work
around Goulburn Base Hospital on Tuesday afternoon.

Southern NSW Local Health District Project Leader Kerry Hort said the increase
from four to nine holes was not unusual.

"This is one of the many steps they have to do to make sure we have all the
right information for the building," Ms Hort said.

Soil samples were collected around the hospital building and car park area. The
process will allow architects to accurately plan for future construction through
analysing the materials in different locations.

"Everything is on track," she said.

These works are the first step in the master plan for the hospitals
redevelopment.

Expansion works are planned to start in the second half of next year.
