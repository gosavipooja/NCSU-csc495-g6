DAMNING media reports - including some of patients eating rotten and infested
food at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital and others dying at Steve Biko
Academic Hospital because of non-functioning machines - have prompted the
government to act.

Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane placed her provincial health department under
administration yesterday, hoping that a technical task team will resolve the
ills of Gauteng's health facilities.

However, the announcement does not affect the position of MEC for Health Hope
Papo, who will remain the department's political boss.

The administrator and technical team would report to him. Mokonyane said the
administration would be different from the Limpopo Health Department's
situation, as there was no national government intervention in Gauteng.

The premier said she was expecting the administrator to set up a technical team
that would focus on bringing changes to health logistics, hospital management,
human resources, financial management and communications.

She emphasised that the administrator and technical team would cease to exist
once the department's problems were over. She also said the team would work with
the acting head of department Ndoda Biyela until a new head had been appointed.

The DA welcomed Mokonyane's announcement.
