TEMPLE TERRACE - With the economy in a slump, more and more people are finding
it difficult to make ends meet. The problem can be particularly prevalent in
families where there are major medical expenses.

No matter the circumstances, the Temple Terrace Kiwanis Club wants to make
certain Santa visits every child in the greater Tampa Bay area - especially
those in children's hospitals.

To accomplish that goal, the club, in partnership with the Key Club at Tampa Bay
Technical High School and Live@Home, a business that provides caregivers for the
elderly and infirmed, is sponsoring a toy drive..

Kiwanis president-elect Jamie Klingman, Live@Home owner and toy drive
coordinator, said the club had two reasons for selecting the project:

* Kiwanis was founded on the principle of serving of children.

* Because parents of ill youngsters often face exorbitant medical bills, they
are left with little or no money to pay for anything but the essentials.

Unwrapped new or like-new items may be dropped off at the Greater Temple Terrace
Chamber of Commerce office, Tampa Bay Tech or Live@Home. The toys will be
collected, wrapped and distributed by local representatives from Children's
Miracle Network, a global alliance of 170 hospitals.

"We've been assured that gifts will stay locally," Klingman said.

Temple Terrace Kiwanian Terry Mishler said he intends to provide as many gifts
as he can.

"More and more people are in need. So we need to step forward even more than
ever," Mishler said.

"I think this particular event is in keeping with our mission to serve the
children of the world," said Joe Gross, a club director.

Debra Conn, a Tampa Bay Tech guidance counselor and the Key Club sponsor, said
the students are having fun with the project.

The Key Club is the high school equivalent of the Kiwanis Club.

"Some of them have brought in some really nice things," she said. "They are
especially enjoying it knowing the toys are going to kids in the hospital and
that they will help them both physically and emotionally."
