A hospital radio station is searching for new volunteers to help out on the
airwaves.

Radio Cavell at The Royal Oldham Hospital has a number of positions up for grabs
from presenters to technical support.

Director Graham Nelmes said: "We're always looking for fresh blood.

"The main role on offer is being a presenter.

"You can either be part of a team or for those who are a little more keener you
can run your own show.

"We're also looking for people who may be able to help us on the technical side,
those who may have worked in telecommunications or with satellite dishes and
those who know their way around a computer."

Administrative and support roles are also available and full training will be
given.

Graham added: "There really is a job for everyone. It's an invaluable service
for patients and they love getting their requests played.

"It's not a lot of fun to be in hospital but we provide something that will lift
the boredom a little."

Radio Cavell was launched in 1972 but the hospital has had a radio service since
the 1930s when a matron used to use the tannoy system to entertain patients at
the Boundary Park Hospital every Friday afternoon.

The station is licenced to broadcast on the hospital grounds but hopes to also
stream online to target even more people.

Anyone who would like to volunteer their services is asked to email
volunteer@radiocavell.co.uk or call 0161 628 4106.
