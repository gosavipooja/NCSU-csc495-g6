DATELINE: Dehradun


Dehradun, Jan. 13 -- The Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority has postponed
the sealing of the Guru Ram Rai Technical Institute and given the institute
management time for presenting relevant documents.

On January 17, the authority will hear the reply of the Mahant Indresh Hospital
to the show-cause notice it has been served. Both these institutions may face
official action as the buildings of the hospital and technical institute were
constructed without the building maps being approved by the authority.

Cases were registered against Guru Ram Rai Technical Institute and Mahant
Indresh Hospital in the previous year during the tenure of RK Sudhanshu, the
previous vice-chairman of MDDA. The incumbent vice-chairman, BVRC Purushottam,
ordered officials to seal the technical institute and served a show-cause notice
to the hospital.

Purushottam informed that the institute management has sought time to present
relevant documents and further action will be finalised after a couple of days
after these documents are studied.

The hospital will submit its case which will be heard by the authority on
January 17. Both these buildings are said to have been constructed without the
building maps being approved by the authority. This not only blatantly flouted
building by-laws but also resulted in MDDA incurring substantial losses.
