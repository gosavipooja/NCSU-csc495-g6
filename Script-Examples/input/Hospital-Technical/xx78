Hospital stint for ITE trainees

                          January 31, 2001, Wednesday


JOINT-TRAINEESHIP PROGRAMME

HEALTH-CARE workers are being trained with new skills to meet rapid changes as a
result of recent advances in medical technology.

Alexandra Hospital and the Institute for Technical Education (ITE) launched a
joint traineeship programme for these workers on Monday.

The programme will begin with 33 fresh N-level graduates who have just joined
ITE.

Twelve of them will be trained in basic office skills, such as word processing,
at ITE for seven weeks, followed by one year of in-house hospital training.

The rest will begin training in basic nursing care at Alexandra Hospital,
followed by the same in-house training programme.

The trainees will be taught medical terminology, first aid and emergency
management, as well as using computers to retrieve medical records.

All trainees who complete the course will be given the option of becoming
full-time employees at the hospital.

Mrs Chew Kwee Tiang, chief operations officer at Alexandra Hospital, said: "This
means that our staff, who previously could only manage the registration counter,
can now assist our medical staff with simple medical procedures and routine
clerical tasks.

"This will allow our medical staff to focus on providing care for patients."

During the launch ceremony at the Alexandra Hospital auditorium, Dr Law Song
Seng, director and chief executive officer of ITE, said: "Although ITE has a
comprehensive pre-employment training programme and supports continuing
education and training for some 30,000 adults a year, it is unable to meet all
training needs on its own.

"As such, ITE relies on industry-based training schemes."
