LOUISE'S LOCKS LOPPED OFF FOR CHARITY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 167 words


A COVENTRY librarian's assistant has lost her locks to raise funds for the
Walsgrave Hospital Kidney Patients' Association.

Louise Farnell-Dyson, aged 45, was inspired to support the charity because her
cousin, Peter Farnell, also aged 45, is due to have a kidney transplant next
week.

She was whisked out of the library at Coventry Technical College to become a
model for students in the hairdressing department.

Mrs Farnell-Dyson, who lives in Templar Avenue, Tile Hill, said: "Everyone was a
bit shocked about me having my head shaved and said I was very brave.

"But that's nothing compared to what my cousin is going through and I just
wanted to do something to help this important cause."

The Kidney Patients Association provides medical equipment and other items to
improve life for patients on the renal unit.

To make a donation send a cheque or postal order, made out for Walsgrave
Hospital KPA, to Coventry Technical College Library, The Butts, Coventry, CV1
3GD.
