Hospital won't fight union issue

DATELINE: BAYONET POINT



Officials from Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point say they do not plan to
challenge a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board that would uphold
employees' recent elections to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

"We just want to move forward and continue to provide the best possible health
care we can," said Kurt Conover, director of business development for the
hospital.

In October, the hospital's nurses and technical unit employees voted to join the
Teamsters. But the hospital filed unfair labor charges against the union on the
nurses' election, and the Teamsters challenged seven votes in the technical unit
election.

A hearing officer from the labor board has ruled that there was no merit to the
hospital or the union's objections and that the nurses' vote should be upheld.
The officer also ruled that the challenged votes for the technical workers
should be opened and counted. That election was 51-46 to unionize, so the votes
could change the outcome of the election.

Wednesday was the deadline to file objections to the hearing officer's findings.
The union filed no objections.

The hearing officer's ruling is a recommendation that will be submitted to the
labor board's Tampa office. Officials there will then decide whether to adopt
the ruling and certify the elections.
