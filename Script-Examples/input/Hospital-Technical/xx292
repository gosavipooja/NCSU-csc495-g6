SECTION: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY; IN BRIEF; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 124 words


A FORMER hospital in Sligo with planning permission to be converted into a
156-bedroom hotel, conference centre and holiday village has come on the market.
Denis O'Reilly of Gunne is quoting a guideline price of Pounds 700,000 to Pounds
1 million for the impressive three-storey over basement Victorian building,
which has about 90,000 square feet of space. There is a further 50,000 square
feet in other buildings at the rear. The former St Columba's Hospital is one
mile from the town and is opposite Sligo Regional Technical College. Gunne says
that in addition to a hotel, the buildings could be used for student
accommodation or could be converted into apartments, a nursing home, educational
institute or for leisure purposes.
