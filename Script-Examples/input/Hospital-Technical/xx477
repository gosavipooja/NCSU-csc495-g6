Nurses at Castro Valley's Eden Medical Center averted a strike by reaching a
tentative agreement early Tuesday.

The nurses had been set to walk the picket line Friday in a contract dispute
over wages and retirement benefits.

Despite Tuesday's tentative agreement, at least 100 technical workers,
represented by the Teamsters, haven't reached a contract settlement with the
hospital and are prepared to strike Friday. Those workers include pharmacy
employees, and lab and X-ray technicians.

Hospital officials said they have arranged for other licensed technical staff
members to fill any open positions during the strike.

"We're hopeful we can reach a conclusion prior to that end," said Cassandra
Phelps, a hospital spokeswoman.

The tentative agreement, which affects 350 registered nurses, is expected to be
ratified Thursday.

"A strike is never what anybody wants to do," said Liz Jacobs, a spokeswoman for
the California Nurses Association. "What we're trying to do with these
agreements is improve and introduce retirement plans. We're looking at things to
retain and attract new nurses to the profession."

As part of the settlement, the nurses will receive an 18 percent wage increase
during the next three years, setting the salary range for a full-time nurse at
$75,000 to $93,000 a year.

The new contract also includes improvements in staffing and health care
benefits, some of the main points of contention. Nurses who are at least 55
years of age with more than 10 years of experience will receive
employer-subsidized post-retirement health care coverage based on years of
service.

"Although it was a difficult process, it reached a fair conclusion," Phelps
said.
