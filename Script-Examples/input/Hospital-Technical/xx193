LENGTH: 220 words


Construction worker John Williams has retired after a career spanning half a
century.  Mr Williams, of Easton-in-Gordano, started work as an apprentice
plasterer in 1954.

He followed in his father Harold's footsteps when he began to learn his trade at
Bristol Technical School at the age of 13 and started work at 16 before managing
projects including Bristol's dental hospital, eye hospital and the maternity
hospital. He also worked on the Bath Magistrates Court, the Parish Wharf Sports
Centre in Portishead and the Rehabilitation Unit at the Weston General Hospital
as well as spending time abroad, building essential infrastructure in
middle-Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iraq.

He has now retired as project manager with Bristol-based Midas Construction.

Mr Williams said: "I would not have worked in the industry for this long if I
had not enjoyed it and I've made some really good friends.

"Things have changed a good deal over the past 50 years, but I still have
immense respect for the people who work in construction - it will be hard to
walk away." Ian Fairbairn, director of Midas Construction, said: "He is a true
gentlemen who has gained immense respect, admiration and affection from the many
hundreds of people with whom he has worked for half a century."
