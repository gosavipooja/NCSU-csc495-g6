WINTER HAVEN -- United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1625, which has
been handing out leaflets to Winter Haven Hospital employees, is having an
informational meeting today to measure their interest in having the union
represent them.

Presentations will be made at 7:30 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. at the
Holiday Inn in Winter Haven, said Ed Chambers, president of the statewide local.

Union staffers and supporters will be there throughout the day to answer
questions.

The meeting is targeted to registered nurses; licensed practical nurses and
other technical employees, such as technicians and technologists; and to service
and maintenance employees.

"We've gotten lots of calls," he said. "But you need the cards before you can go
to the labor board."

Before requesting an election, the union would want signatures expressing
interest in representation from 50 percent of any group, such as registered
nurses, it would seek to represent.

UFCW Local 1625 represents registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and
other technical employees at Lakeland Regional Medical Center. Registered nurses
at Lakeland Regional voted in 1997 to have the union represent them. Technical
employees voted for representation in 2000.

The union represents support staff at Brandwyne Health Care Center and at Winter
Haven Health and Rehabilitation. Its membership also includes registered nurses
at Brandon Regional Hospital and at Kindred (formerly Vencor) in Tampa, some
phosphate-chemical workers and some Disney World employees, Chambers said.
