Washington: Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:
 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality Agency Information Collection Activities: Proposed Collection; Comment
Request AGENCY: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, HHS. ACTION: Notice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY:
This notice announces the intention of the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve
the proposed information collection project: ``The AHRQ Safety Program for
Improving Surgical Care and Recovery.'' This proposed information collection was
previously published in the Federal Register titled ``The AHRQ Safety Program
for Enhancing Surgical Care and Recovery,'' on May 18, 2017 and allowed 60 days
for public comment. AHRQ did not receive any substantive comments.

The purpose of this notice is to allow an additional 30 days for public comment.
DATES: Comments on this notice must be received by August 28, 2017. ADDRESSES:
Written comments should be submitted to: AHRQ's OMB Desk Officer by fax at (202)
395-6974 (attention: AHRQ's desk officer) or by email at
OIRA_submission@omb.eop.gov (attention: AHRQ's desk officer). FOR FURTHER
INFORMATION CONTACT: Doris Lefkowitz, AHRQ Reports Clearance Officer, (301)
427-1477, or by email at doris.lefkowitz@AHRQ.hhs.gov SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Proposed Project In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-
3521, AHRQ invites the public to comment on this proposed information
collection. The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery is
a quality improvement project that aims to provide technical assistance to
hospitals to help them implement evidence-based practices to improve outcomes
and prevent complications among patients who undergo surgery. Enhanced recovery
pathways are a constellation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative
practices that decrease complications and accelerate recovery. A number of
studies and meta- analyses have demonstrated successful results. In order to
facilitate broader adoption of these evidence-based practices among U.S.
hospitals, this AHRQ project will adapt the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety
Program (CUSP), which has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to
reducing other patient harms, to enhanced recovery of surgical patients. The
approach uses a combination of clinical and cultural (i.e., technical and
adaptive) intervention components which include promoting leadership and
frontline staff engagement, close teamwork among surgeons, anesthesia providers,
and nurses, as well as enhancing patient communication and engagement.
Interested hospitals will voluntarily participate. This project has the
following goals:  Improve outcomes of surgical patients by disseminating and
 supporting implementation of evidence-based enhanced recovery practices
 within the CUSP framework.
      Develop a bundle of technical and adaptive interventions
 and associated tools and educational materials to support
 implementation.
      Provide technical assistance and training to hospitals for
 implementing enhanced recovery practices.
      Assess the adoption, and evaluate the effectiveness of,
 the intervention among the participating hospitals.
     This project is being conducted by AHRQ through its contractor
 Johns Hopkins University; with subcontractors Westat, and the American
 College of Surgeons. The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical
 Care and Recovery is being undertaken pursuant to AHRQ's mission to
 enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health
 services, and access to such services, through the establishment of a
 broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of
 improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the
 prevention of diseases and other health conditions. 42 U.S.C. 299.
Method of Collection
    To achieve the goals of this project the following data collections
 will be implemented:
     (1) Safety Culture Survey. Hospitals will assess the impact of
 participation in the project on perioperative safety culture by having
 their staff members who will be part of the enhanced recovery program
 complete a survey adapted from the AHRQ Surveys on Patient Safety
 Culture (SOPS) at the beginning and end of the program. The hospital's
 enhanced recovery project team will receive their survey results and
 then debrief their staff on their safety culture and identify
 opportunities for further improvement. The national
[[Page 35209]]
project team will provide technical assistance for this effort.
 Participating hospitals will promote awareness of the survey among
 their staff, coordinate implementation of the survey, encourage and
 provide staff the time to complete the survey, and organize a local
 debrief of the reports of their hospital's results. The national
 project team will assist this effort by providing an electronic portal
 for hospital staff to anonymously complete the survey and by analyzing
 the data and sending a report to the hospital. Data will also be
 analyzed in aggregate across all participating hospitals to evaluate
 the impact of the overall quality improvement effort on measured safety
 culture.
     (2) Patient Experience Survey. Hospitals will also assess the
 impact of participation in the project on patients' experience with
 care. This will be done via administration of a patient experience
 survey to patients discharged after a qualifying surgery. Patients will
 receive a pre-implementation assessment of patient experience after a
 qualifying surgery and a post-implementation assessment of patient
 experience will be administered to patients who were treated the
 enhanced recovery program at participating hospitals. The survey will
 be administered by the national project team. Hospitals will provide
 patient contact information to the project team after execution of a
 data use agreement. This information will be provided to the national
 project team to send the survey to patients on behalf of the hospital.
 The national project team will provide a summative report to each
 hospital with the hospital's results to promote additional local
 quality improvement work. Data will also be analyzed in aggregate
 across all participating hospitals to evaluate the impact of the
 overall quality improvement effort on patient experience of care.
     (3) Readiness and Implementation Assessments: Semi-structured
 qualitative interviews. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be
 conducted with key stakeholders at participating hospitals (e.g.,
 project leads, physician project champions, etc.). These include a
 readiness assessment conducted after a hospital's enrollment in the
 project and an implementation assessment conducted after a period of
 implementation. The readiness assessment will help identify which, if
 any, technical components of the enhanced surgical care and recovery
 intervention already exist at the hospital, project management and
 resources, clinician engagement, leadership engagement and potential
 barriers and facilitators to implementation. The implementation
 assessment will evaluate what elements of the enhanced recovery
 practices have been adopted, resources invested, team participation,
 major barriers (e.g., medications, equipment, trained personnel), and
 leadership participation. These assessments will help identify training
 needs of hospitals and inform the national team's approach. In
 addition, the results will inform the national team's understanding of
 local adaptations of the intervention and the degree to which
 intervention fidelity impacts changes in outcomes.
     (4) Site visits. Semi-structured site visits will be conducted at a
 subset of participating hospitals. Findings will help inform the
 national project implementation strategy. Information from these visits
 will be critical in understanding if and how team and/or leadership
 issues may affect implementation of enhanced recovery practices,
 including how this may differ across surgical services. Interviews will
 help uncover and clarify misalignments in roles, needed time and
 resources, best practices, and potential enablers of and barriers to
 enhanced surgical care and recovery implementation. Site visits will be
 conducted at approximately 4 hospitals per year, and each will be 1 day
 long. The types of hospital personnel anticipated being involved in
 part or all of the site visit include senior leadership, perioperative
 leadership, and patient safety and quality staff. Participating
 hospitals will receive a structured debriefing and brief summary report
 at the end of the one-day visit.
