1:	MWH tied for 8th out of 128 hospitals around the state--Carilion Roanoke
Memorial Hospital, Inova Loudoun Hospital, and Martha Jefferson Hospital in
Charlottesville also earned an eighth-place ranking.

2:	MWH ranked seventh out of 58 hospitals in the Washington area, and tied with
Inova Loudoun Hospital among eight Northern Virginia hospitals that were
evaluated.

3:	According to the report, the hospital performed at near the level of nationally
ranked hospitals in those six areas.

4:	"Our U.S. News rankings acknowledge that our highly skilled team of physicians,
nurses and other staff provide the best quality care for our community," Kevin
Van Renan, senior vice president and administrator of Mary Washington, said in a
news release.

5:	According to the release, the U.S. News report evaluated almost 4,800 hospitals
around the country for the report, which is in its 24th year.

6:	"A hospital that emerges from our analysis as one of the best has much to be
proud of," Avery Comarow, U.S. News health rankings editor, said in the news
release.

7:	"Only about 15 percent of hospitals are recognized for their high
performance as among their region's best.

8:	Just 3 percent of all hospitals earn a
national ranking in any specialty."

9:	Virginia has four hospitals that are nationally ranked, and all were in the top
four in the state rankings.

10:	The rankings don't include military and VA hospitals because, U.S. News said,
the government doesn't release data for those hospitals.

11:	The region's smaller hospitals--Spotsylvania Regional Medical Center, the
MWH-affiliated Stafford Hospital, Culpeper Regional Hospital and Fauquier
Hospital--were not ranked in the report.

12:	The report also includes patient responses to a federally written satisfaction
survey.

13:	According to those surveys, 59 percent of MWH patients gave the hospital the
highest satisfaction ranking --the average for Virginia hospitals was 66
percent.

Utah hospitals 'high-performing' but not 'best' in annual hospital rankings
report

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dobner The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: NEWS; State

LENGTH: 581 words


Not one Utah hospital lands on the top tier of the U.S. News & World Report Best
Hospital Rankings released Tuesday.

15:	The 24th annual report ranks hospitals nationwide based on performance in each
of 16 medical specialities, including cancer treatment, cardiology and heart
surgery, gynecology, neurology, orthopedics and others.

16:	Some 147 hospitals
performed well-enough to earn a national ranking in one or more specialities.

17:	Another 591 were ranked "high-performing" in respective states and regional
areas, including eight Utah hospitals.

18:	The rankings are designed to help patients and families find the best sources
for high-quality medical care in their communities.

19:	Salt Lake City's LDS Hospital earned a national "best" ranking in 2012-2013 for
its gynecology care and was first among Utah hospitals.

20:	"But we are very proud that Intermountain hospitals are consistently ranked
among the best in the nation, and in the state, each year by numerous rankings
services," Gomez said.

21:	"This recognition is a tribute to all of our employees
and physician partners who strive to provide the highest-quality of patient care
possible."

22:	"If the hospital's scores were toward the lower part of the range in
some number of those specialties, then it is entirely possible that the next
year it might be pushed out by other hospitals with improved performance , or
drop out on its own if its performance falls off just a little."

23:	The best hospitals are chosen according to a matrix that takes into account such
things as nurse staffing levels, patient volume, patient survival and safety
data, the availability of clinically proven technologies.

24:	That statistical data
is drawn from federal health care agencies and professional associations.

Hackensack University Medical Center: U.S. News & World Report Ranks
HackensackUMC as the Number One Hospital in NJ, Among Top Three New York Metro
Area Hospitals

LENGTH: 504  words


New Delhi, July 16 -- U.S. News & World Report today reported that Hackensack
University Medical Center is the number one hospital in New Jersey and one of
the top three New York metro area hospitals.

27:	"This year's rankings demonstrate, once again, that New Jersey residents don't
need to cross the Hudson to get the best possible healthcare," said Robert C.
Garrett, president and chief executive officer of Hackensack University Health
Network.

28:	"Further, our ranking in the top three hospitals in the entire NY Metro
area, among some of the best hospitals in the world, suggests residents
throughout the region should actively consider HackensackUMC for their health
needs."

29:	In addition to the Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital recently being named
among the top 50 best children's hospitals for neurology and neurosurgery,
HackensackUMC received nine national rankings in this year's review.

30:	They are:

* Cancer

* Cardiology & Heart Surgery

* Ear, Nose & Throat

* Gastroenterology & GI Surgery

* Geriatrics

* Neurology & Neurosurgery

* Orthopedics

* Pulmonology

* Urology

The medical center was also listed as high-performing in the New York metro area
in: Diabetes & Endocrinology, Gynecology, and Nephrology.

31:	"These rankings are not only a testament to the world-class care our
HackensackUMC team implements, but also reflects the supportive and encouraging
environment that HackensackUMC provides to its medical team," said Ihor S.
Sawczuk, M.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer.

32:	U.S. News evaluates hospitals in 16 adult specialties.

33:	In most specialties, it
ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals and recognizes other high-performing
hospitals that provide care at nearly the level of their nationally ranked
peers.

34:	The Best Hospital rankings, now in their 24th year, recognize hospitals
that excel in treating the most challenging patients.

35:	"Only about 15
percent of hospitals are recognized for their high performance as among their
region's best.

36:	Just 3 percent of all hospitals earn a national ranking in any
specialty."

37:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition, or added risk because of other health problems or age.

38:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, the adequacy of nurse
staffing levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most
specialties.

July 18--Parkview Medical Center is ranked among the nation's top hospitals for
its work in three speciality areas, according to recent U.S. News & World Report
rankings.

40:	"The entire Parkview team of employees, physicians, volunteers and board
members, all played a key role in improving patient care and outcomes as well as
enhancing our customer service," said Mike Baxter, president and CEO of
Parkview.

41:	To be rated among the top hospitals in the nation, Parkview had to be listed
among the top 25 percent of the qualifying hospitals.

42:	"A hospital that emerges from our analysis as one of the best has much to be
proud of," said Avery Comarow, U.S. News' health ranking editor.

43:	"Only about 15 percent of hospitals are recognized for their high performance as
among their region's best.

44:	Just three percent of all hospitals earn a national
ranking."

45:	The rankings also will be available in print form at bookstores and newsstands
beginning Aug. 27.

hospitals and survey results from more than 2,800 pediatric specialists.

47:	To make
the best pediatric hospitals honor roll, a hospital had to score near the top of
at least three of 10 medical specialties ranked.

Move for evaluation system draws mixed reaction

                                October 10, 1995

Ravi Veloo


Secondary schools and junior colleges are ranked annually.

69:	And now, the
Government is considering ways to size up Government and restructured hospitals
against each other.

70:	The news, however, is drawing mixed responses from doctors,
hospital administrators and the public.

71:	Now, the
Ministry of Health is studying ways to rank government and restructured
hospitals.

72:	Revealing this in response to queries from Life!, the ministry said the aim of
having rankings was to spur the hospitals to be more efficient and improve their
service.

73:	On whether private hospitals would also be involved, the ministry said it was
too early to say, as no decision had been taken on even what performance
indicators should be used.

74:	News that the ministry was studying how to rank hospitals drew mixed responses
from doctors, hospital administrators and the public.

75:	A LOT of concern from doctors and the public is directed at whether performance
indicators to be used in such rankings would be an accurate reflection of a
hospital's worth.

76:	Indeed, the ministry itself said: "The main problem faced in ranking is how to
ensure that the indicators selected are equitable and compensate for the
variation in the specialities offered and the case-mix of patients seen in
various hospitals."

77:	A poser is how hospitals here are going to be compared when some, such as the
National Skin Centre and the Singapore National Eye Centre, are so highly
specialised.

78:	The medical director of the Singapore National Eye Centre, Professor Arthur Lim,
indicated some of the difficulties.

79:	While he welcomed the idea of competition, he said that sizing up hospitals
against each other would present inordinate problems.

80:	"How do you compare compassion in the treatment of patients?

81:	Stressing the importance of comparing like with like, he said: "Even with
outcomes, for example, if you compare the results of my cataract operations with
a younger surgeon's, his results will be better for the simple reason that as a
more senior person, I get the more complicated cataract cases."

82:	The National University Hospital's CEO, Mr Pek Beng Choon, said ranking could be
useful as a form of benchmarking, but cautioned: "Obvious and apparent
indicators such as cancelled admissions and waiting time may be valid, but not
necessarily accurate in reflecting the standard of health care."

83:	But a senior administrator, who asked not be named, said such comments showed
doctors were paying too much mind to the art of doctoring and not enough to the
science of it.

84:	He said: "Dealing with patients is an art, but the practice of medicine is a
science, and a lot of the performance is measurable.

85:	On his side, the administrator has the argument that hospitals are ranked in
some countries already, and from press reports, hospitals that came out lower in
the rankings in Britain and the US have pledged to do better, and sometimes
deliver on their promise.

86:	Another problem is in quantifying and measuring health care.

87:	"In health care, quality of care includes cost-efficient care provided by
caring, committed and competent staff.

88:	BUT even if the rankings are accepted as fair, many doctors
have reservations about what might follow.

89:	The Singapore Medical Association, which represents about 60 per cent of all the
doctors in Singapore, opposed the idea, saying: "Ranking can have undesirable
effects."

90:	"Both situations would result in an increase in health-care costs, which runs
counter to national health policies."

91:	They were keen to have more information how hospitals compared, but some were
concerned that the pursuit of a higher ranking could lead to hospitals turning
away patients who could not do them proud.

92:	OTHERS questioned the use of ranking hospitals.

93:	The ministry wants ranking because it "serves as one indicator of performance
and a guide on the care provided by the hospitals".

94:	But the Singapore Medical Association said: "We believe the most objective form
of ranking would be peer review and the testimony of patients.

95:	"It is not the waiting time at clinics or the number of MRI machines and liver
transplants performed in hospitals that will influence patients' choice of
hospitals.

96:	Those in support of ranking said that it was precisely the lack of accurate
measurements and over-reliance on impressions of friends and relatives that made
an objective ranking by the ministry attractive.

97:	"Better health care comes from a bottom-up approach when the larger base of
patients demands better care," he said.

98:	"Ranking a hospital remains a top-down
approach to improving health care.

99:	Another point was that many indicators used in other countries measured only the
peripherals of health care, such as waiting time and average costs of a stay;
these did not indicate the quality of care.

100:	Lee, 36, said something which seemed to sum up the feelings of
many: "The point of rankings is to spur hospitals to compete.

101:	: How will Singapore General Hospital (above) line up
against the other hospitals?

Mount Sinai Medical Center: First-Ever National Summit on Hospital Rankings
Demonstrates Impact and Explores Possibilities for Change

LENGTH: 1145  words


New Delhi, Sept. 28 -- At a summit on hospital ranking systems held on September
27, 2012, leaders from the nation's top hospitals and U.S. News & World Report
agreed that its annual "Best Hospitals" list is among the most comprehensive and
useful available.

103:	The distinguished group also explored a broad range of ways in
which the methodologies could continue to be improved.

104:	Possible improvements
that were discussed include risk adjustment for socioeconomic factors and
projected health outcomes, measurement of scientific and medical innovation,
clinical trial participation, investment in and use of cutting-edge information
such as genomics, and overall patient experience.

105:	It brought together editors and statisticians from U.S.
News and more than 125 representatives from leading hospitals across the
country.

106:	Panelists and audience participants made it clear that rankings matter for
hospitals and consumers.

107:	But it was also evident that
not all rankings measure the same things, essentially leaving to consumers the
responsibility to examine what the various methodologies are designed to
reflect.

108:	"Rankings are just
one part of the equation when it comes to consumer choice, but as millions of
aging baby boomers seek specialty care, and 30 million more Americans enter the
health care system, they are becoming increasingly important to the
decision-making process."

109:	They also discussed how the rankings could
be expanded to respond to advances in technology and biomedical science, as well
as the impact of socioeconomic status on health outcomes.

110:	"In our role as a data provider we want to take advantage of the flood of
new health care data becoming available and do it in a responsive and
responsible way."

111:	Avery Comarow, U.S. News Health Rankings Editor, told the audience that the
rankings are designed to help people who are "in trouble," facing complex
medical conditions requiring the finest specialty care.

112:	He noted that given new
data sources, the time may be at hand to create companion rankings for community
hospitals delivering routine care, which makes up the lion's share of health
services today.

113:	Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital, pointed out that
hospitals often respond to rankings in an effort to improve their grade.

114:	If you are a patient with
colon cancer, we now know from genomic screening that a subset of patients will
respond to a certain drug.

115:	Only the best hospitals will have genomic capability
to choose the right drug for a patient's tumor."

116:	In addition, rankings should reflect hospitals that
are caring for patients who have comorbid conditions that affect their health
status, such as patients who are waitlisted for a liver transplant but who die
from coronary arrest that is related to their overall poor health.

117:	Dr. Davis and others agreed that there should be adjustments for the geographic
availability of nursing home and hospice beds, because in their absence,
patients die in hospitals, affecting the institution's mortality rates.

118:	Lastly,
as many of the participants noted, socioeconomic variables must be looked at
more closely so so-called "safety-net hospitals" are not disadvantaged because
they care for the sickest and most impoverished patients.

119:	"The challenge for all of us is to make certain
that what we are all doing is improving our processes and outcomes.

120:	The point is
to take these measures and ask, how do we get to where we want to be?"

Hospital rankings paint incomplete picture, officials say

BYLINE: Hannah Poturalski, Hamilton JournalNews, Ohio

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1120 words


Nov. 11--With an inundation of available hospital data and rankings systems
floating in cyberspace, area hospital officials say it's best for patients to
rely on primary care physicians for recommendations on where to be treated.

122:	"All rating systems are not the same; they look at quality and patient
satisfaction in different ways," said Colleen O'Toole, chief administrative
officer and vice president for operations at the Greater Cincinnati Health
Council.

123:	The nonprofit health council has more than 30 hospitals within its membership,
and O'Toole said while they're all competing for a higher market share and more
patients, they are still able to unite for sharing best practices.

124:	"As a field, health
care hasn't done a good job showing what's quality and how it's measured."

125:	Ohio has nine hospitals that are nationally ranked by U.S. News and World
Report.

126:	An additional 30 other hospitals met standards for strong performance
within Ohio, according to the agency.

127:	Officials at Kettering Health Network -- with two hospitals ranked in the
state's top 30 by U.S. News and World Report this year -- study the measures
used by each ranking agency after the reports are released, said Teri Sholder,
chief quality officer for Kettering Health.

128:	"We value any organization that's working to improve health care," Sholder said.

129:	"We encourage patients to heed the advice of their primary care physician ...
unless they understand the complex method and measures ranked."

130:	At the health council, O'Toole echoed that sentiment adding that relying on just
one rankings system can leave the consumer with incomplete information.

131:	Donna Mollaun, of Fairfield, said when determining what health care facilities
to visit she relies on word of mouth from friends and others, as well as her
personal experiences in the past.

132:	"The research I do is about the doctor ... how many procedures does he/she
perform weekly in that specialty and where the doctor's educated," Mollaun said.

133:	She underwent a Whipple procedure in 2003 to
remove the cancer.

134:	"This decision (to move hospitals) was based on prior personal experiences
with Mercy in Fairfield and comments from other former patients and their
families."

135:	Urban said
the rankings are considered "a beauty contest" to some in the health care field
because of not being based on "unbiased, impartial data."

136:	"My advice is go to that health care organization you know, from personal
experience or family experience, that is obsessed with clinical quality and
patient safety," Urban said.

137:	Within the Premier Health network, which operates Atrium Medical Center in
Middletown, three hospitals are ranked within the top 40 in Ohio, according to
U.S. News and World Report.

138:	Atrium is ranked 30th in the state; with the Good
Samaritan and Miami Valley hospitals in Dayton also falling in the top.

139:	Dr. Tammy Lundstrom, senior vice president and chief medical officer for Premier
Health, said that while the network does pay attention to rankings systems, its
physician leadership council and other groups strive to make it a holistic
approach.

140:	She said it's much harder for
the hospital system, let alone patients, to find comparative data for pediatric
care due to a lack of rankings systems or mandatory reporting requirements for
pediatric hospitals in the country.

141:	"U.S. News and World Report ... is really one of the best methods where we can
understand our performance compared to our peer hospitals and other children's
hospitals," Alessandrini said.

142:	The U.S.
News ranking considers structure (equipment, staffing, certification); processes
of care; and outcomes (survival, pain level).

143:	"Over time the measures are becoming increasingly better and evidence-based and
it makes it more important and relevant for us to use the data for comparison,"
Alessandrini said.

Most hospitals in Pakistan have poor web presence

A majority of the hospitals in Pakistan have a poor Web presence, reveals the '
Ranking Web of World Hospitals,' a tool that shows the commitment of health
organisations to electronic publication and dissemination of academic
information related to medicine.

146:	The following is the world ranking of Pakistani hospitals: CIDP International
Foundation (1842), Jinnah Memorial Hospital (2400), Sindh Institute of Urology
and Transplantation (2836), Shifa International Hospital (3760), Shaukat Khanum
Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (4064), Al Shifa Trust Eye Hospital
(5109), Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (5911), Layton Rahmatulla
Benevolent Trust Eye Hospital(7200), Liaquat National Hospital (7333), Allama
Iqbal Medical College and Jinnah Hospital Lahore (7659), Indus Hospital (7679),
Services Institute of Medical Sciences (9000), Fatima Memorial System (9190),
Rehman Medical Institute (9549), Aadil Hospital (9621), Marie Adelaide Leprosy
Centre (10409), Tabba Heart Institute (11008), Lady Reading Hospital (11136),
Sharif Medical City (11385), Dr Ziauddin Hospital Karachi (11385).

147:	"The Web indicators applied do not measure the quality of
treatment and health care offered by the hospitals.

148:	So please be aware that if
you are looking for the best place to treat a health condition, this ranking is
not appropriated for such a search," CSIC clarifies.

149:	"If the web
performance of an institution is below the expected position according to their
academic excellence, hospital authorities should reconsider their web policy,
promoting substantial increases of the volume and quality of their electronic
publications," CSIC states.

150:	According to CSIC many hospitals, even in the developed countries, have a poor
presence in the Web or no presence at all.

151:	The
goal of the project is to convince academic and political communities of the
importance of the web publication not only for dissemination of academic
knowledge but also for measuring scientific activities, performance and impact.

152:	The current objective of the ranking is to promote Web publication by hospitals.

153:	The ranking measures the volume, visibility and impact of web pages published by
hospitals, with special emphasis in the scientific output (referred papers,
conference contributions, pre-prints, monographs, thesis, reports) but also
taking into account other materials (courseware, seminars or workshops
documentation, digital libraries, databases, multimedia, personal pages) and the
general information on the institution, their departments, research groups or
supporting services and people working or attending courses.

154:	The project intends to have true global coverage, not narrowing the analysis to
a few hundreds of institutions (world-class hospitals) but including as many
organisations as possible.

155:	The original aim of the ranking is to promote Web publication, not to rank
institutions.

156:	Web publication is cheaper, maintaining the
high standards of quality of peer review processes.

157:	It could also reach much
larger potential audiences, offering access to scientific knowledge to
researchers and institutions located in developing countries and also to third
parties (economic, industrial, political or cultural stakeholders) in their own
community.

158:	Not only was the hospital ranked among the very best hospitals in the nation for
Gynecology care in 2014-15, U.S. News also ranked Sarasota Memorial among the
top five hospitals in Florida and #1 in southern Florida for overall care.

159:	The annual "Best Hospitals" rankings, now in their 25th year, recognize
hospitals that excel in treating the most challenging patients.

160:	Sarasota
Memorial Chief Medical Operations Officer Steve Taylor, MD, attributed the
hospital's consistently high rankings to the exceptional expertise and
dedication of its entire team - from physicians and nurses to leaders, staff and
volunteers throughout the health system.

161:	"We are honored to be recognized among the nation's best hospitals - it means as
much to us today as the first time we made the list 10 years ago," said Taylor
said.

162:	It also was
recognized nationally as a "high performing" hospital in eight specialties - up
from six specialties last year:

Cancer (new this year)

Diabetes & Endocrinology

Gastroenterology & GI Surgery

Geriatrics

Nephrology

Orthopedics

Pulmonology

Urology (new this year)

On a state and metropolitan level, U.S. News ranked Sarasota Memorial #1 in
South Florida, #1 in the Sarasota-Venice-North Port-Bradenton region and #5 (up
from #6 in 2013) among all 265 Florida hospitals for overall care.

163:	U.S. News evaluated hospitals in 16 adult specialties and ranked the top 50 in
most of the specialties.

164:	Just 3 percent of the nearly 5,000 hospitals that were
analyzed for Best Hospitals 2014-15 earned national ranking in even one
specialty.

165:	"A Best Hospital has demonstrated its expertise in treating the most
challenging patients."

166:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition or extra risk because of age or multiple health problems.

167:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, adequacy of nurse staffing
levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most specialties.

168:	Mott Children's Hospital
is among the best children's hospitals in the country in pediatric specialties
and is the only hospital in Michigan ranked in all 10 specialties evaluated,
according to the U.S. News & World Report's 2013-14 Best Children's Hospitals
rankings.

169:	The new rankings recognize
the top 50 children's hospitals in each of those 10 pediatric specialties.

170:	"We
are extremely proud that we continue to get high rankings from U.S. News & World
Report for the tremendous care we provide to our patients and families at C.S.

171:	U.S. News introduced the Best Children's Hospitals
rankings in 2007 to help families of sick children find the best medical care
available.

172:	"We have worked very hard at improving quality of care, safety
and patient satisfaction at C.S.

173:	Mott Children's Hospital, so it is very
meaningful to be honored once again as a comprehensive children's hospital in
all of the specialty pediatric disciplines," says Valerie Castle, M.D., Ravitz
professor and chair of the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases
and a pediatric oncologist.

174:	Mott Children's Hospital, said he's glad that U.S. News and World Report
has recognized the tremendous care provided for the children at C.S.

175:	Mott Children's Hospital eighth in the nation,
demonstrate that we are on the right track, providing top-notch care for often
the sickest children with the most complicated diseases from Michigan and around
the world," says Dickinson, who also is a professor of pediatric
gastroenterology.

176:	Mott's Congenital Heart Center performs over
850 cardiac operations each year -- from the most common to the most complex.

177:	As
an international referral center for children with complex congenital heart
problems, U-M has the second largest congenital heart program in the United
States.

178:	To gather data, U.S. News used two surveys: a clinical
questionnaire sent to 179 pediatric hospitals and, for the reputational
assessment, a survey of 150 pediatric specialists and subspecialists in each
specialty.

179:	The 1,500 physicians were asked where they would send the sickest
children in their specialty, setting aside location and expense.

180:	A separate reputational survey in
which 1,500 pediatric specialists - 150 in each specialty - were asked where
they would send the sickest children in their specialty made up the remaining 25
percent.

July 21--Allegheny Valley Hospital has been ranked by a national publication as
the fifth best hospital in a region that prides itself on its medical
facilities.

183:	U.S. News & World Report released its 2011-12 Best Hospital rankings this week,
which place the Harrison hospital in a fifth place tie with two larger, better
known Pittsburgh hospitals -- Mercy and West Penn.

184:	5 locally, but Health Grades has had us ranked in the
top 5 percent of hospitals nationally for six consecutive years," Laubacher
said.

185:	That includes placing in the top 1 percent of U.S. hospitals in 2009.

186:	"What matters is we have in this
Valley one of the top hospitals in the region, in the state and in the nation
for clinical quality."

187:	The honor roll consists of the top 17 American hospitals and puts UPMC
Presbyterian, at No.

188:	"Everybody gets caught up in this competition between UPMC and West
Penn-Allegheny," Manko said, " but I think it's good to say that people in

that they have here whether it is UPMC or AGH (West Penn-Allegheny)."

Lancaster General Hospital again has been ranked among the nation's best in four
adult specialties, U.S. News & World Report said Tuesday.

'Only four govt hospitals among the top 20 in the country'

BYLINE: IKRAM JUNAIDI

SECTION: Vol.

LENGTH: 561  words


According to the 'Ranking Web of World Hospitals', only four government-run
hospitals are among the top 20 in the country, while the best public sector
hospital in Pakistan ranks 5,911 in the world.

202:	Although the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has topped the list
of public sector hospitals in the country, it is in seventh position in the
overall list of Pakistan's hospitals.

203:	Private hospitals occupy the first six positions in the list of the country's
hospitals.

204:	According to the rankings, of the top 40 hospitals in South Asia, 35 are in
India, three in Pakistan and one each in Bangladesh and Nepal.

205:	Of the top 20 hospitals in South Asia, 19 hospitals in India and one in
Bangladesh are the top 20 hospitals.

206:	However, just one hospital in India made it
on the list of the 20 best hospitals in all of Asia.

207:	A number of parameters are analysed when ranking hospitals which include the
number of facilities, equipment, the number of experts in the hospital and the
number of scholars affiliated with the hospital.

208:	Dr Akram explained that incinerators are used to dispose of hospital waste and
according to international standards, hospitals should have their own
incinerators to ensure that waste is disposed on time and to avoid the spread of
infections.

If Augusta's hospitals were in school, University Hospital would be at the top
of the class in safety, according to one group's rankings.

210:	The Leapfrog Group released its Hospital Safety Score today for more than 2,500
acute care hospitals in the U.S., assigning them a letter grade based on 28
different safety processes and outcome measures, such as hospital-acquired
infections.

211:	Doctors Hospital noted in a statement that there are many groups grading or
rating hospitals and pointed to its ranking as a Top Performer by the Joint
Commission last year, as was Trinity.

212:	Georgia Regents issued a statement saying
that the Leapfrog ranking was "one of many tools patients may use when making
health care decisions," and advised patients to use many sources, including
physicians and family, when choosing a provider.

213:	A big reason University's grade improved was the validation of its computerized
prescriber order entry system in its Epic information technology system, which
passed a live test by a Leapfrog vendor in December to see if it could flag
medications that should not be taken together or that would be contradicted by a
patient's lab tests, said Ed Burr, the senior vice president for legal affairs
and compliance officer for University.

214:	"We've seen a big uptick in hospitals' performance on the CPOE measure," she
said.

215:	University was one of 17 in Georgia to earn an A out of 64 hospitals ranked, and
the state came in 24th in the percentage of hospitals that got the top ranking.

216:	Overall, the number of A hospitals declined from 813 in the previous ranking to
804 in the current review.

217:	The rankings do not include specialty or Critical Access Hospitals, and many
smaller hospitals that do not have a large intensive care unit will not have
enough data in the categories used in the ranking and thus are not included,
Danforth said.

218:	The rankings are important because many unintended errors still occur daily in
U.S. hospitals and harm patients, said Leapfrog CEO Leah Binder.

219:	She pointed to
a recent New England Journal of Medicine estimate that 1 in 25 patients acquires
an infection while in the hospital.

220:	"That's just one more reason that more than 1,000 people die every day from
preventable medical errors," Binder said.

221:	That also drives up costs, which are passed on to the payers.

222:	Leapfrog works
with 40 different business coalitions to look at these preventable errors and
their costs and provide transparency about how hospitals perform, Binder said.

223:	"They're interested in what are the things that drive the cost of health care
and I think they have made a good bet that it is avoidable complications," Burr
said.

Butler County hospitals move up in U.S. News ranking

LENGTH: 629 words


July 15--BUTLER COUNTY -- Two Butler County hospitals are among the state's best
for treating patients with the most life-threatening and rare conditions,
according to a new national ranking of hospitals released today.

225:	For 2014-15, U.S. News evaluated nearly 5,000 hospitals in 16 adult specialties
-- with just 3 percent of those hospitals earning a national ranking in a
specialty.

226:	The analysis is based mostly on death rates for patients who represent
especially challenging cases, as well as marks for patient safety and other
measures of performance that can be assessed using hard data.

227:	U.S. News also
uses an annual reputational survey of physicians who are asked to name hospitals
they consider the best in their specialty for difficult cases, according to U.S.
News.

228:	"To be recognized as one of the best hospitals in the Cincinnati metro
area and the state shows that residents in Hamilton do not need to travel far to
receive quality care."

229:	"U.S. News strives to provide patients and their families with the most
comprehensive data available on hospitals," said Avery Comarow, U.S. News health
rankings editor.

230:	"With an estimated 400,000 deaths occurring in hospitals each
year from medical errors, measuring safety performance is critical to
understanding how well a hospital cares for its patients."

231:	"We always focus on quality, safety and service, that's not changed," Joseph
said, but the hospital has added service lines of bariatric surgery, a trauma
center and surgical intensive care unit.

232:	Joseph said the ranking from U.S. News is just "one tool in the toolbox" for
community members to use in making their health care decisions.

233:	Other regional hospitals that made top marks include: TriHealth's Bethesda North
Hospital (third in Ohio) and Good Samaritan Hospital (seventh in Ohio); The
Christ Hospital (eighth in Ohio); and University of Cincinnati Medical Center
(tied for eighth in Ohio).

234:	The rankings are available online at www.usnews.com.

Medicare ranks hospitals for patient satisfaction

BYLINE: Fred Hiers, Ocala Star-Banner, Fla.

LENGTH: 498 words


April 18--Munroe Regional Medical Center and Ocala Health's two hospitals scored
among some of the lowest ranking hospitals for patient satisfaction in a recent
government health care survey.

237:	Ocala Regional Medical Center/West Marion Community, which were graded together,
and Munroe both received two stars out of a possible five in a rating system
created by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the government agency
that oversees those health programs.

238:	The new rating reflects patient feedback about their hospital stay and covers
such issues as how attentive nurses were, how communicative doctors were and how
clean hospital rooms and restrooms were during the patient's stay.

239:	The site also allows consumers to compare the rankings of various hospitals in
their areas.

240:	The CMS star ranking is the latest data collection made available to the public
in ranking hospitals.

241:	Earlier, the CMS also began making available hospital
rankings based on other medical factors such as recovery and readmissions.

242:	The data was collected on almost 3,500 Medicare-certified, acute-care hospitals.

243:	CMS said in a press release that the data made available "builds on a larger
effort a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to build a health care
system that delivers better care, spends health care dollars more wisely, and
results in healthier people."

244:	Of the hospitals in the survey, 251 received five-star ratings, according to
Modern Healthcare, an online publication that monitors healthcare issues.

245:	In eight of the 11 survey questions, Munroe received responses that ranked lower
than average for Florida hospitals.

246:	However, quality of
care and the patient experience has always been and will remain a top priority
for Ocala Health."

247:	Other area hospitals that received two-star rankings included The Villages
Regional Hospital, Citrus Memorial Hospital and Leesburg Regional Medical
Center.

248:	"These star ratings also encourage hospitals and clinicians to strive to
continuously improve the patient experience and quality of care delivered to all
patients," CMS' Dr. Patrick Conway said in the agency news release.

July 23--IU Health, whose hospitals include facilities in Bloomington, Bedford
and Martinsville, has been named to the national "honor roll" in the U.S. News
and World Report's 23rd annual Best Hospitals rankings, the only Indiana
hospital or hospital system to receive that distinction.

268:	The 17 hospitals and hospital systems in the U.S. making the honor roll
represent 0.3 percent of the nearly 5,000 hospitals and systems in the country
that were evaluated by looking at government-supplied data that shows how well
they were doing in 16 adult specialties -- taking into account such things as
survival rates, patient safety scores and a hospital's reputation among doctors
who practice that specialty.

269:	"These hospitals are the kinds of medical centers that should be on your list
when you need the best care," said U.S. News health rankings editor Avery
Comarow.

270:	"They are where other hospitals send the toughest cases."

271:	IU Health includes the IU Health Proton Therapy Center in Bloomington and 17
hospitals, including IU Health Bloomington Hospital, IU Health Bedford Hospital,
IU Health Paoli Hospital and IU Health Morgan Hospital.

272:	IU Health Bloomington Hospital was ranked 11th among the 119 hospitals in
Indiana, and received "high performing" specialty rankings in gastroenterology
and urology.

273:	Referring to IU Health's inclusion on the honor roll, Moore said, "This is a big
day for over 2,800 employees in Bloomington and the 26,000 IU Health employees
across the state that contribute to our success, day in and day out.

274:	"It makes us feel really good about bringing together two great organizations in
IU Health and Bloomington Hospital, and that kind of national ranking is a great
testimony to the caliber of physicians and hospitals that make up IU Health."

275:	This marks the 15th straight year IU Health has made the U.S. News Best
Hospitals list, which this year is made up of 148 of the top hospitals in the
country among the 4,793 that were evaluated.

276:	"It made it this year because of its continued emphasis across the IU
Health system on delivering pre-eminent care from top-notch physicians and
clinicians focusing on clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction."

277:	Dr. Richard Graffis, executive vice president and chief medical officer at IU
Health, said because the rankings provided by U.S. News take into account
clinical expertise in complex cases and successful outcomes, they can help
people "identify the top ranking specialists to treat their condition."

278:	"We appreciate these rankings because they affect our ability to recruit the
most skilled physicians, employ the best staff, pioneer leading research efforts
and provide the latest and most innovative treatment -- all in our mission to
care for the people of Indiana and beyond," Graffis said.

279:	The complete rankings and methodology are available at
http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals.

280:	A hospital earned two points if it ranked among the top 10
hospitals in America in any of the 12 specialties in which the U.S. News
rankings are driven mostly by objective data, such as survival rates and patient
safety.

281:	In the other four specialties, where ranking is based on each hospital's
reputation among doctors who practice that specialty, the top five hospitals in
the country received two Honor Roll points and the next five got one point.

282:	The
number of hospitals making the honor roll differs from year to year, depending
on how many hospitals make the cut by meeting the established criteria.

LENGTH: 723 words


July 16--YOUNGSTOWN -- U.S. News & World Report has ranked both St. Elizabeth
Health Center and St. Elizabeth Boardman Health Center among Ohio's best
hospitals, giving both high marks in several specialties.

368:	Published annually as a part of its "Best" series of consumer guides that
include rankings of colleges, graduate schools and cars and trucks, the latest
"Best Hospitals" list pulled data from 4,806 hospitals nationwide by examining
each location's performance across 16 specialties.

369:	In most specialties, U.S. News ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals and
recognizes other high-performing hospitals that provide care at nearly the level
of their nationally ranked peers.

370:	"We've always, at Akron Children's Hospital, prided ourselves on the services we
provide," Lyden said.

371:	This is just our national reputation catching up with what we have always
thought was great substance."

372:	Across all 16 specialties, only 147 U.S. hospitals performed well enough to be
nationally ranked in one or more.

373:	"It independently verifies that our hospitals provide a
high level of care, eliminating the need for area residents to travel out of
town to receive quality care.

374:	I have to give credit to our doctors, nurses,
support staff and board members for concentrating on quality outcomes for our
patients."

375:	The rankings are intended to help consumers find the best inpatient-care
facilities in the country, but the publication encourages its readers to conduct
their own research and acknowledges that some hospitals better suited for local
treatment are not always included on the list.

376:	Karyn Frederick, executive director of the Mahoning County Medical Society,
which represents nearly 500 practicing, retired and resident physicians in
Mahoning County, said it's great that local hospitals are included on the list,
but she said just because some are not included does not mean they are
inadequate, adding that the methodology of the study is like comparing "apples
to oranges" in some cases.

377:	"A hospital that emerges from our analysis as one of the best has much to be
proud of," said Avery Comarow, U.S. News health rankings editor.

378:	"Only about 15
percent of hospitals are recognized for their high performance as among their
region's best.

379:	Just 3 percent of all hospitals earn a national ranking in any
specialty."

Brigham and Women's Hospital Ranks Among Top 10 Hospitals in the Nation

LENGTH: 314  words


New Delhi, Sept. 15 -- Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is once again
recognized as one of the nation's top hospitals, ranking ninth in the 2012 U.S.
News & World Report Honor Roll of America's Best Hospitals.

391:	"Our presence for the past two decades on the U.S. News & World Report Honor
Roll serves as a tangible symbol of our community's dedication to the mission of
this great academic medical center," said Betsy Nabel MD, president of BWH.

392:	"This ranking is also a clear reflection of the commitment and talent of our
staff and employees who day in and day out deliver the best, safest care
possible to our patients and their families."

393:	In this year's ranking of the nation's top hospitals, BWH ranked among the top
10 in seven categories: Cancer, Cardiology and Heart Surgery, Diabetes and
Endocrinology, Gynecology, Nephrology, Pulmonology and Rheumatology.

394:	Once again, BWH and Massachusetts General Hospital were the only hospitals in
New England to be on the top 10 Honor Roll, making Boston the only city in the
country to have more than one hospital in the top 10.

395:	U.S. News analyzed data on nearly 4,800 medical centers to produce this year's
rankings of hospitals that demonstrate unusually high expertise across multiple
specialties.

396:	Only 148 hospitals earned a national ranking in one or more of the
16 specialties, which include cancer, cardiology & heart surgery, orthopedics
and pulmonology.

397:	The rankings, now
available online at www.usnews.com/besthospitals, will be published in the
magazine's August issue as part of it 2011-2012 Best Hospitals guide.

398:	The measure is an improvement from last year, when CU ranked 20th in the
country, and it marks the highest a Colorado hospital has ever scored in the
overall rankings.

399:	U.S. News compiles the rankings by looking at objective measurements of care
such as whether fewer patients die of certain conditions at the hospital than
would be expected based on national averages and patient safety.

400:	The rankings
also take into account a survey of about 16,000 doctors.

401:	Dr. Jeff Glasheen, the chief quality officer for the broader UCHealth system,
said the rankings have in recent years placed more emphasis on the quality and
safety measurements and less on the survey.

402:	"Which translates to around 30 patients per year who survive their stay who

A healthy disagreement;
Which hospitals are best?

405:	1B

LENGTH: 1280 words


Nearly 40% of consumers surveyed last year said they use hospital ratings to
choose a health care facility, but there's little agreement among the lists,
raising questions about their value.

406:	At least 15 different groups rank health care organizations,
but no two judge them the same way, which leads to widely divergent results,
says Brent James, a medical doctor who is chief quality officer at Intermountain
Healthcare in Salt Lake City.

407:	"All of us publish newspaper ads that say we're the
best on one or another."

408:	U.S. News & World Report, which has been ranking hospitals for 20 years, met
with dozens of hospital leaders Thursday to discuss ways to improve its own
list, which some doctors who head hospitals say is the best.

409:	The survey of consumers' views on hospitals, by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health, found Americans evenly split on
whether they think there are big or small differences in the quality of care
among their local hospitals.

410:	The U.S. News rankings are "as comprehensive a picture as possible of the
quality of hospitals in this country," says Peter Slavin, an internal medicine
doctor and president of Massachusetts General Hospital, which ranked first.

411:	When Consumer Reports came out with its best hospitals list in July, however,
Mass.

412:	While the magazine ultimately gave NYC hospitals, overall, low marks, Consumer
Reports did change its methodology to reflect some suggestions it received from
hospitals in the city, says John Santa, an internal medicine doctor who heads
the magazine's health ratings center.

413:	Its ratings, started in 2010, have also
been expanded to include a composite safety score and several new elements, such
as the likelihood a hospital would expose patients to the radiation in two CAT
scans rather than just one.

414:	Other discrepancies between lists:

New York City's Peninsula Hospital Center was ranked relatively high for safety
by Consumer Reports this summer but was facing serious financial issues and was
shut down by the state because of safety problems three months before the
magazine came out.

415:	Santa calls the focus on Peninsula "a distraction by NYC
hospitals who cannot explain their poor performances."

416:	The Joint Commission, which accredits health care facilities, released its list
of the "Top Performers" among hospitals last week, and it didn't include some of
the most respected, such as Baltimore's Johns Hopkins, which had long topped
U.S. News' list until Mass.

417:	Joint Commission
spokesman Bret Coons says it doesn't consider its list "a hospital ranking" and
says it is recognizing hospitals on "accountability measures" they report to its
Joint Commission.

418:	Kenneth Davis, Mount Sinai's CEO, questions Consumer Reports'
ability to distinguish between hospitals: "This isn't like rating automobiles.

419:	"Ours are for high-level, specialty hospitals where you go if you are really
sick or got a big problem," says Kelly.

420:	Davis says the ratings should also factor in
the technological advancements, such as how "wired" a hospital is with medical
records.

421:	Kelly says, though, that he thinks it's important his rankings take into
consideration that many of the hospitals accept the "tricky cases  the people
often have illnesses that have a high risk of death."

422:	Davis says these factors,
as well as mortality rates, should better emphasize the physical condition of
the patients some hospitals treat most frequently.

423:	When rankings are adjusted for factors including race or socioeconomic status,
you "hide what is happening to those people," says Santa.

424:	One thing that all sides seem to agree on is that there is a larger benefit to
society if hospitals work to improve their rankings on the myriad lists.

425:	While "rankings are not hugely accurate," James of Salt Lake City says they
prompt hospitals to focus "on better patient care, which is what they should
focus on."

426:	"We welcome others wading into the challenge of figuring out what's wrong with
U.S. hospitals," says Santa.

Clinch Memorial Hospital patients are among the most satisfied in the country,
according to an analysis done by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS).

428:	The Pay-For-Performance Measure Trends Analysis collected by CMS showed Clinch
Memorial had the top ranking in the state out of 112 Georgia hospitals in
"Communication with Nurses," and finished second in the state in five other
categories - "Communication with Doctors," "Responsiveness of Staff,"
"Communication about Medicines," "Patient's Rooms and Bathrooms Were Always Kept
Clean," and overall rating of hospital.

429:	"I want to convey to the community that we are good, but still have a ways to go
to be the best," said new CMH Administrator Greg Brown.

430:	In "Area Around Patient's Room Always Kept Quiet At Night,"
CMH was 11th in the state.

431:	And in "Discharge Information," Clinch Memorial was
106th out of 112 state hospitals.

432:	In the "Communication with Nurses" category, CMH was 25th
nationally out of 3,903 hospitals in the United States.

The national reputation of H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center got another boost Friday
when it was ranked 10th in the U.S. News & World Report annual list of best
cancer hospitals.

435:	The magazine, which analyzed data from 205 medical centers nationwide, rated
Moffitt just below Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Johns Hopkins and the Mayo Clinic.

436:	Patricia Goldsmith, a Moffitt spokeswoman, said the distinction is a tribute to
the 15-year-old center's doctors, nurses and researchers.

437:	The magazine's rankings are based on several categories, including mortality
rates, the ratio of nurses to beds and technology services.

438:	Also critical is a
hospital's reputation among doctors nationwide.

439:	Three other Tampa Bay area hospitals made the magazine's Top 50 in different
specialties.

440:	Dr. Frank Mastandrea, a urologist at St. Joseph's, attributes the department's
rise to younger doctors' being trained to perform more complex surgeries and the
hospital's investment in detecting and treating prostate cancer.

441:	Bill Hervey, a spokesman for Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, which
didn't make the list, said there are hundreds of entities that rank hospitals
each year.

442:	Some, he said, even strike deals in which hospitals are ranked in the
top 10 but then have to pay the ranking organization to use the distinction in
their marketing.

443:	While Hervey said he isn't trying to diminish the achievements of area
hospitals, he said only one ranking matters to Bayfront, that of the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.

444:	Other Florida hospitals making the list were Shands Hospital at the University
of Florida, Florida Hospital Medical Center in Orlando and the Mayo Clinic in
Jacksonville.

U.S. News ranks University of Rochester Medical Center as top rated Rochester

LENGTH: 478  words


In its first ever regional ranking of major metropolitan area hospitals, U.S.
News and World Report placed the University of Rochester Medical Center as the
top rated hospital in the Rochester area.

488:	The magazine has been ranking hospitals for over 20 years but expanded it this
year to include regional rankings in the 52 largest metropolitan areas,
explained URMC spokeswoman Teri D'Agostino.

489:	The listing recognizes hospitals with a top 25 percent ranking in at least one
of 16 medical specialties.

490:	"So being
recognized in 11 of the 12 specialties that include a quality component (the
other four factors were based on reputation) validates our efforts to
consistently improve the quality and safety of our patients' care and be at the
level of the best programs nationally. "

491:	D'Agostino said the magazine's methodology "is getting better" but is just one
of several hospital rankings and URMC has other ways of comparing itself to
similar hospitals.

492:	The University HealthSystem Consortium is URMC's "most
definitive measure" in that it compares URMC against its peers.

493:	D'Agostino said the U.S. News study includes smaller hospitals that may not
offer the same services or serve as many patients.

494:	When patients are facing serious cancer [for example],
they'll look at resources such as this. "

495:	Of the 13 hospitals in the area, the ranking listed Rochester General Hospital
second with nine ranked specialties and Highland Hospital third with one
(gynecology).

496:	U.S. News also compiled an honor roll of the top hospitals in the country using
the specialty criteria.

497:	The entire rankings, along with an explanation of the criteria used, may be
found at www.usnews.com/hospitals.

498:	"No matter how skilled or deep their expertise, even 'best hospitals' don't do
everything right," said U.S. News & World Report writer Avery Comarow.

499:	"But when
high stakes call for unusual capabilities, they are hospitals that can save
lives that might be lost or preserve quality of life that might be sacrificed. "

The Dayton area is at the top of a national list ranking hospitals with low
mortality rates, according to a report Tuesday from the health care ratings
firm, Health Grades Inc.

Dayton ranked first, and three other Ohio metros - Cincinnati, Cleveland and
Akron - ranked in the Top 20.

513:	The ranking was based on whether the mortality
rate was lower than the national average for 16 different conditions and
procedures.

514:	The rankings were drawn from publicly available data using Medicare cost reports
for 4,500 hospitals across the country, said Dr. Archelle Georgiou, a physician
and adviser to Health Grades.

515:	"Sometimes there's a misperception that we promote these hospitals because they
pay to play.

516:	Health Grades reviews hospitals independently but charges hospitals that promote
its ratings.

517:	Kettering Health Network's Grandview Medical Center has been named as one of the
Top 50 hospitals in the nation based on mortality and complication rates across
27 different conditions and procedures for at least the past seven years.

518:	Richard Haas, president of Grandview Medical Center, said the rankings, which
include results for Southview Medical Center in Washington Township, reflect
years of dedication in applying evidence-based best practices at the hospitals.

519:	"The medical staff and nursing
staff follow the same procedures with every patient."

520:	The rankings, he said, "are a tribute to all of the hospitals in our community
and the quality of care that they give."

Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association, said the areas under review for the
rankings were the ones that resonate most with patients.

RMC makes list of top regional hospitals

LENGTH: 832 words


Feb. 28--As far as one national publication is concerned, Regional Medical
Center is one of the best regional hospitals in the nation.

524:	Only 140 out of nearly 5,000 surveyed hospitals
across the nation were included among the best regional hospital ranking.

525:	U.S. News defines regional hospitals as those that serve residents living
outside large metropolitan areas.

526:	In a recent press release, U.S. News Health Rankings editor Avery Comarow said
hospitals such as RMC offer a high level of medical care to communities that
otherwise might have limited options.

527:	"They are fully capable of providing first-rate care, even to most patients who
have serious conditions or need demanding procedures."

528:	U.S. News determines its rankings by evaluating 16
high-stakes categories at hospitals, such as cardiology and heart surgery,
gastroenterology, neurology and neurosurgery.

529:	U.S. News reported that the 140
hospitals ranked were ones that performed well enough in at least one of the 16
specialties.

530:	"And if RMC got two categories and only 140 hospitals were ranked, I think
that's definitely a good thing," Blackmon said.

531:	Gastroenterology includes procedures on the digestive system, including
colonoscopies and removal of esophageal cancer.

532:	U.S. News based the rankings of those two specialties on a number of factors,
including the level of nurse staffing and patient volume at the hospital along
with the survival rate for people who have procedures performed there.

533:	"This is nothing we applied for," Judy Gould, vice president of marketing and
professional services at RMC, said of the ranking.

534:	"Customer service and patient service are above many other
hospitals."

535:	Last year, RMC performed 8,300 gastroenterological procedures.

536:	"They deal with hospitals all over
and they'd put us up against the hospitals in Birmingham.

537:	"Our physicians are very good at that -- at choosing if a patient needs more
aggressive procedures," he said.

538:	I think our nurses do a very good job of that."

539:	Diane Hawkins, assistant vice president for patient care services at RMC, said
it's very important to provide quality care for a patient throughout his or her
entire stay at the hospital, not just during his or her medical procedure.

540:	"We have people do hourly rounds to check on patients, to cut down on them
trying to get up and possibly get injured," Hawkins said.

541:	"And we assess every
patient for fall risk, particularly stroke patients, and have them wear
bracelets so we can identify them readily."

2 hospitals ranked area's best;
U.S. News & World Report rates facilities.Miami Valley, Kettering tie for 17th
in Ohio in annual rankings.

Miami Valley Hospital and Kettering Medical Center tied as the highest-ranked
hospitals in the Dayton metro area in U.S. News & World Report's 2014-15 "Best
Hospitals'' rankings released Tuesday.

544:	Both hospitals ranked No.

545:	17 in Ohio - the highest ranking in the metro area -
based on such measures as their resources and technologies, patient outcomes
including survival rates, and performance in different specialties, according to
U.S. News.

546:	"It certainly
speaks to the high level of exceptional care that each patient receives at our
hospital and all Kettering Health Network hospitals."

547:	Mark Shaker, chief executive of Miami Valley Hospital, said his hospital's
ranking was a tribute to the hard work and dedication of its doctors and staff.

548:	"We owe these kinds of accolades to our medical staff and our employees," Shaker
said.

549:	"They're the ones that are day-to-day taking care of our patients with
compassion and the highest level of quality."

550:	The annual rankings also rely heavily on hospitals' reputations; this has drawn
criticism from industry insiders who contend that the biggest and best-known
hospitals receive the highest scores based largely on their names.

551:	"A lot of these rating agencies have different formulas and different
approaches, and health systems can't control any of that," Shaker said.

552:	U.S. News responded to the criticism last year by saying its rankings do not
represent hospitals that are the best for every patient but the best medical
centers for the most difficult patients to treat.

553:	The Cleveland Clinic was also the only Ohio hospital to be included on the U.S.
News "Honor Roll" list of hospitals nationally ranked in at least six
specialties.

554:	Although they didn't make the national rankings, Miami Valley and Kettering were
both ranked as "high-performing" hospitals in eight specialties.

The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Earns More #1 Rankings than Any Other
Hospital in the Nation on U.S. News & World Report's Best Children's Hospital
List

LENGTH: 285  words


New Delhi, June 5 -- Ranking number one in six of 10 specialties, The Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has more #1 rankings than any other children's
hospital in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report's Best Children's
Hospital survey.

556:	"No matter how many times we achieve the top ranking in this survey, it is
always an exhilarating, inspiring and humbling experience - and a reminder of
our responsibility to constantly improve healthcare for children," said Steven
M. Altschuler, M.D., chief executive officer of The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia.

557:	"I could not be prouder of our employees and the extraordinary
care they provide to our patients every day.

558:	The U.S. News survey methodology combines clinical data points from 178
pediatric centers with a separate reputational score derived from a survey in
which 1,500 pediatric specialists - 150 in each specialty - were asked to which
hospital they would send the sickest children.

559:	For more information about CHOP's rankings please visit:
http://www.chop.edu/about/best-in-the-nation/us-news-world-report.html

The full rankings and methodology are available at
www.usnews.com/childrenshospitals.

560:	Next among the 40 hospitals in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area
were H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Brandon Regional Hospital and Community
Hospital in New Port Richey.

561:	All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg was rated
the top children's hospital.

562:	This is the 21st year U.S. News & World Report has compared the nation's
hospitals but the first time it has evaluated hospitals in metropolitan markets.

563:	The publication ranked hospitals in 52 markets with populations of 1 million or
more.

564:	To be among the 622 metro-area hospitals ranked, hospitals had to fall within
the Top 25 percent in at least one of the 16 specialty areas U.S. News & World
Report considers in its rankings.

565:	Hospitals with a national ranking in even one
specialty area rated better than hospitals with high-performing designations in
multiple areas but without any national ranking.

Jacksonville hospitals fared well in the latest rankings by U.S. News & World
Report, issued last week, with three hospitals in the top 10 in the state and
six among the top 20 of Florida's 271 hospitals.

567:	Baptist Medical Center and Mayo Clinic Jacksonville tied for the top ranking
among Jacksonville hospitals and also tied for fourth place among Florida
hospitals.

568:	Only 147 hospitals nationally, out of almost 5,000 surveyed,
achieved national ranking in at least one speciality.

569:	No other Jacksonville-area
hospitals were ranked.

570:	Eighteen hospitals, none in Florida, made the U.S. News national honor roll by
ranking near the top of at least six of 16 specialties surveyed.

571:	In June it was announced that U.S. News ranked Wolfson Children's Hospital among
the 50 best children's hospitals in five of 10 specialties.

THE U.S. News & World Report's 24th annual Best Hospitals rankings showcase 747
of the nation's nearly 5,000 hospitals.

575:	Of those 747, 147 were nationally ranked in at least one of 16 medical
specialties, from cancer to cardiology to urology.

576:	Factors used by U.S. News to compile the rankings include survival rates, safety
measures, nurse-to-patient ratios, other data and the subjective reputation of
specialists around the country.

577:	Last year, for example, we were able to reduce the role of
hospitals' reputation and rely even more heavily than before on objective data
like patient survival rates and nurse staffing levels," said Ben Harder, general
manager of health rankings, U.S. News & World Report.

578:	"This year, for the first time, we were able to identify and separate out cases
in which patients arrived at the hospital with conditions that put them at risk
for getting certain injuries or illnesses during their hospital stay.

579:	When we
then evaluated hospitals' performance in patient safety, which accounts for 5%
of each hospital's score toward the rankings, that analytical improvement
enabled us to make sure hospitals weren't unfairly penalized if they treated
more than their share of patients with these so-called 'present on admission'
conditions.

580:	The results helped lift some hospitals' rankings this year, in some
cases leading them to score higher in as many as 12 of the 16 medical
specialties."

581:	All the rankings are available at usnews.com/besthospitals.

582:	"We've proven in just a short amount of time we could build a program based on
quality outcomes for patients, develop record-high patient satisfaction, conduct
significant cardiac research and help teach the next generation of physicians,"
Bob Page, KU Hospital's president and CEO, said in a statement.

583:	Page credited the work of physicians, nurses and other staff for helping achieve
a 0.63 risk-adjusted mortality rate in the rankings for Medicare patients from
2003 to 2005.

584:	A rate lower than 1.00 means the mortality rate was lower than
expected, and KU Hospital ranked fourth-lowest in that criteria of the top 50
hospitals on the list, said hospital spokesman Dennis McCulloch.

585:	"We've said for a long time that we have pride in every aspect of our operation,
and we will stack up the quality of this operation to any hospital in the
country," he said.

U.S. News ranks Methodist, Ingalls among top hospitals

BYLINE: Susan Erler, The Times, Munster, Ind.

588:	25--A U.S. News and World Report lists two local hospitals among America's
best.

589:	Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey and The Methodist Hospitals, with campuses
in Gary and Merrillville, were ranked in the top 50 for excellence in neurology
and neurosurgery in the report, which hit newsstands earlier this month.

590:	U.S. News analyzed data on 5,453 medical centers to produce rankings in 16
specialties, including cancer, heart surgery and kidney disease, as well
neurology and neurosurgery, among others.

591:	Only 170 hospitals were ranked in one or more of the specialties.

592:	"Our excellence in neurology and neurosurgery truly puts us on par with the very
best hospitals anywhere," Ingalls President and Chief Executive Officer Kurt
Johnson said.

593:	University of Chicago, Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Rush University
Medical Center, all in Chicago, also ranked among the top 50 hospitals for
neurology and neurosurgery.

594:	"We are the only hospital in Northwest Indian to have one of its services
recognized nationally," Methodist Hospitals CEO Claude Watts said.

595:	U.S. News ranked the hospitals based on a combination of reputation, mortality
rate -- hospitals' ability to keep patients alive -- and other factors.

Allegheny General Hospital: Four Allegheny Health Network Hospitals Lauded by
U.S. News for Patient Care Quality, Outcomes

LENGTH: 709  words


New Delhi, July 16 -- AGH Named High Performer in 12 Medical Specialties

* West Penn Hospital Earns Top 50 Designation in Gynaecology, Named High
Performer in 9 Specialties


* Forbes Regional Named High Performer in 6 Specialties

* Saint Vincent Designated High-Performing in 6 Specialties

Pittsburgh, PA Four hospitals affiliated with the Allegheny Health Network have
been lauded in the latest ranking of the country's best hospitals by U.S. News
and World Report.

598:	Released online today and slated for publication in August,
the U.S. News 2013-2014 Best Hospitals Guide recognizes Allegheny General
Hospital, Forbes Regional Hospital, Saint Vincent Hospital and West Penn
Hospital as high performing medical centers across multiple clinical
specialties.

599:	"We are excited to once again be acknowledged by U.S. News for the exceptional
level of care that we provide to our patients.

600:	As with the many other quality
accolades that our hospitals have earned over the past few years, the U.S. News
distinction reflects an incredibly dedicated and talented team of physicians,
nurses and ancillary staff, the outstanding efforts of whom make the Allegheny
Health Network a premier healthcare provider and an excellent healthcare choice
for the people of this region," said Tony Farah, MD, Allegheny Health Network's
chief medical officer and president of the Allegheny Clinic.

601:	Just 700 of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals earn U.S. News' designation as
a high performing medical center in the 2013-14 report, and fewer than 150
hospitals achieve a national top 50 ranking in at least one of the 16 medical
specialties.

602:	West Penn Hospital received U.S. News' highest honor this year for the quality
of its women's health program, earning a top 50 national designation in
gynecology.

603:	U.S. News 2013-14 hospital rankings evaluate performance in 16 medical
specialties.

604:	The rankings are based on a combination of objective clinical
information gleaned from Medicare outcomes data and the annual American Hospital
Association Survey - including patient mortality rates, patient safety scores,
nurse-to-patient ratio, procedure volumes and technological capabilities - and a
hospital's reputation score in each category as determined by a random survey of
physicians across the country.

605:	According to Avery Comarow, U.S. News Health Rankings Editor, the core mission
of Best Hospitals is to help guide patients who need an especially high level of
care because of a difficult surgery, a challenging condition, or added risk
because of other health problems or age.

606:	The hospital rankings, Comarow said, are like a GPS-type aid to help steer
patients to hospitals with strong skills in the procedures and medical
conditions that present the biggest challenges.

607:	"All of these hospitals are the kinds of medical centers that should be on your
list when you need the best care," said Comarow.

608:	"They are where other hospitals
send the toughest cases."

609:	Comarow said the regional hospital rankings complement the national rankings by
including hospitals with solid performance nearly at the level of nationally
ranked institutions.

610:	"These hospitals we call 'high performers' are fully capable of giving most
patients first-rate care, even if they have serious conditions or need demanding
procedures," Comarow said.

Efficiency survey nets area hospitals middle ranking

BYLINE: By JEFF MAHONEY

SECTION: METRO; Pg.

612:	B3

LENGTH: 418 words


IN ONTARIO'S hospital efficiency sweepstakes the Hamilton area is running
somewhere in the middle of the pack -- for what it's worth.

613:	According to a ranking system that some hospital representatives say is
extremely complex and doesn't always truly reflect efficiency or quality of
service, Hamilton's St. Joseph's Hospital placed second in its group of six
Ontario hospitals.

614:	The Hamilton Civic Hospitals (the General and the Henderson) came in fifth in
another group, in which 10 hospitals were ranked.

615:	In Halton, Burlington's Joseph Brant Memorial Hospital ranked 16th of 41
hospitals in its group and Oakville-Trafalgar ranked 34th in the same group.

616:	The Ontario hospitals ranked in the report are grouped by number of beds and by
type (teaching hospital, community hospital, trauma centre, etc.).

617:	The efficiency of the hospitals is measured by computing the average cost per
in-patient case, excluding chronic-care patients.

618:	The cases are weighted by the
extent of the treatment required, some treatments being far more costly and
time-consuming than others, says Don Scott, chief executive officer of Joseph
Brant Memorial Hospital.

619:	Mr. Scott says the rankings may be somewhat misleading, because the hospitals
which rank number one in their groups are not necessarily the most efficient.

620:	'If you're at the high end, you're probably not using your resources wisely, but
if you're at the low end (first, second, third in efficiency), you're probably
under-funded.

621:	Those hospitals are not necessarily the most efficient -- they're
probably not spending the money because they simply don't have it.'

622:	The ranking system is part of the Ministry of Health's funding reallocation
initiative in which hospital monies could be diverted from less efficient to
more efficient hospitals, says David Jensen, media information officer with the
Ministry of Health in Toronto.

623:	This year's rankings
are included in a document dealing with 'funding reallocation for fiscal
1994-95.'

624:	No Hamilton-area hospitals are being targeted for funding reallocations, said Ms
Janzen.

625:	"Lancaster's overall safety score was typical of its peers this year, but had
been better than average last year," said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis
at the publication.

626:	Harder added that a measure on which Lancaster did quite well last year - rate
of post-operative hip fractures - was removed from the ranking's methodology.

627:	Thomas E. Beeman, president and CEO of LGH parent organization Lancaster General
Health, called the ranking a validation of the hospital's efforts as well as "a
benchmark for us to measure our continued success."

628:	The annual ranking, now in its 26th year, recognizes hospitals that "excel" in
treating the most difficult cases.

629:	This year just 137 hospitals - less than 3
percent of the approximately 5,000 U.S. facilities evaluated - earned a national
ranking in at least one specialty.

630:	LGH earned the designation on four specialties and three procedures this year:
Geriatrics, nephrology, neurology and neurosurgery, pulmonology, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, heart bypass surgery and heart failure.

631:	Dr. Mark Jacobson, vice president for
medical affairs there, said partnering with patients on individualized care is
an important factor in that program's success.

632:	Danielle Gilmore, spokeswoman for sister facilities Lancaster Regional Medical
Center and Heart of Lancaster Regional Medical Center, noted that "as smaller
community hospitals," the two "are not large enough to be eligible for regional
or national rankings."

633:	However, she said, the U.S. News ranking indicates that they "continue to meet
expected standards in all surveyed medical services."

634:	Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, just outside Lancaster County, was
ranked seventh in the state, with eight nationally ranked children's specialties
and "high performing" designations for seven adult specialties and two adult
procedures.

635:	"We're pleased with the progress they represent on criteria that include several
patient-safety indicators on which we have seen continued progress since 2013,
which is the most recent year represented by this data," said Dr. Andrew
Resnick, chief quality officer at the center.

636:	U.S. News is just one of many organizations producing reports intended to hold
health care organizations accountable and help consumers make wise choices.

637:	Industry experts routinely advise consumers to seek out a range of perspectives
when choosing a health care provider instead of relying on any single
assessment.

638:	These are the hospitals U.S. News & World Report ranks the best in Pennsylvania.

"OHSU's health care is recognized nationally because of the dedication of our
faculty and staff, who work collaboratively to deliver excellence, respect and
results to our patients each and every day," said Peter Rapp, OHSU's executive
vice president and executive director of OHSU Healthcare.

642:	"Despite high rankings
, OHSU is always committed to new ways to advance medicine and improve our
patients' quality of life."

643:	U.S. News evaluates hospitals in 16 adult specialties.

644:	In most specialties, it
ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals and recognizes other high-performing
hospitals that provide care at nearly the level of their nationally ranked
peers.

645:	This year, five OHSU specialties rank among the nation's top 50:

Cancer (#49)
    Diabetes & Endocrinology (#42)
    Geriatrics (#32)
    Gynecology (#44)
    Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery (Ear, Nose & Throat) (#24)

About 15 percent of all hospitals are recognized for their high performance in
their region and just 3 percent of all hospitals earn a national ranking in any
specialty, the news magazine reports.

646:	Additionally, seven of OHSU Hospital's adult specialties were ranked
"high-performing":

Cardiology & Heart Surgery
    Gastroenterology
    Nephrology
    Neurology & Neurosurgery
    Orthopedics
    Pulmonology
    Urology

In addition to adult specialty rankings, U.S. News ranks children's hospitals,
and last month they announced OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital ranks among
the nation's top 50 children's hospitals in eight of 10 pediatric specialties
for 2013-14.

647:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition, or added risk because of other health problems or age.

648:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, the adequacy of nurse
staffing levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most
specialties.

Ochsner Among 35 Hospitals in America Nationally Ranked in 8 or More Specialties

LENGTH: 670  words


New Delhi, July 16 -- Ochsner Medical Center and Ochsner Medical Center West
Bank Campus  have been ranked among the best hospitals in the country in eight
medical specialties, according to U.S. News & World Report's 2013-14 Best
Hospitals rankings.

650:	Only 35 hospitals in the country ranked in eight or more
specialties.

651:	The rankings recognize hospitals that excel in treating the most
challenging patients.

652:	This is the 13th time since 1996 Ochsner has been
recognized as one of the Best Hospitals in America, and in the past three years,
Ochsner has ranked nationally in seven or more medical specialties.

653:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition, or added risk because of other health problems or age.

654:	The rankings
are based on a comprehensive evaluation of hard data, such as patient survival
rates, patient safety data, nurse staffing, patient services and available
technology, in addition to a reputational score based on surveyed physicians.

655:	Fewer than 150 of the country's roughly 5,000 hospitals are nationally ranked in
at least one specialty; Ochsner earned national rankings in eight of the 12
data-driven medical specialties.

656:	"Only about 15

March 16--Decatur Morgan Hospital will retain its Tier 1 ranking with Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Alabama, which means patient copays for service will remain
the same as other hospitals in the Decatur area.

669:	In its preliminary standings for 2016, Blue Cross, which is the state's largest
health insurance provider, had downgraded Decatur Morgan and its Parkway campus
on the Beltline from Tier 1 to Tier 2.

670:	She did not release details, but said the hospital updated its "cost
information."

671:	Blue Cross rolled out the three-tier system in 2009 as a way to evaluate
hospitals annually on fiscal awareness, quality, patient safety and patient
experience.

672:	The new grading system created new copay amounts for inpatient and outpatient
services, depending on the hospital's tier ranking.

673:	The copay for outpatient surgery at a Tier 1 hospital, for example, is $200,
while the copay is $400 at a Tier 2 or Tier 3 hospital.

674:	The
facility has 112 acute-care beds, and the campus on the Beltline, which is used
primarily for OBGYN services, is licensed for 120 beds.

675:	Hayes said the
facilities have an average combined census of between 130 and 135 patients per
day.

676:	Huntsville Hospital Health System has 18 sites and seven acute-care hospitals.

Ranking of top hospitals no cure for health woes;
Experts say annual effort to single out best facilities, while well intentioned,
is making overcrowding worse

BYLINE: Alice Yan

SECTION: NEWS; Yangtze Briefing; Pg.

LENGTH: 709 words


Shanghai's Fudan University has released a list of the mainland's top 100
hospitals, but instead of encouraging hospitals to do better, it has been
criticised for encouraging patients to go to the already overcrowded elite
institutions.

769:	Thanks to the extremely unbalanced distribution of medical resources on the
mainland, 25 of the top 100 are in Beijing, 19 are in Shanghai and 10 are in
Guangdong.

770:	All the hospitals listed in the "Top 100 Comprehensive Hospital Ranking"
released by Fudan's Hospital Management Institute on Sunday are
government-funded.

771:	Gao Jiechun , who is in charge of the project, said it allowed top hospitals to
know their exact position in comparison with other Class-A hospitals and gave
the public a guide to the best hospitals and specialist departments, the Jiefang
Daily reported.

772:	Bao Yong , a public health professor from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said
the recent hospital rankings would help direct more people into those already
crowded facilities, which ran counter to the goal of health reform.

773:	The
authorities want the bulk of patients, especially those with chronic diseases,
to attend class-B or class-C hospitals, with class-A ones left to deal with rare
or difficult medical problems.

774:	It's a big headache for the health sector because class-A hospitals, which have
more than 500 beds and are also engaged in higher education and medical
research, are too crowded.

775:	Beds for patients often overflow into the corridors.

776:	The China Health Yearbook 2011 said the bed usage rate in class-A hospitals was
102.9 per cent, compared with 87 per cent in class-B hospitals, which have 101
to 500 beds and serve several communities.

777:	Meanwhile, 56 per cent of the beds were used in class-C, or community, hospitals
with less than 100 beds.

778:	Bao said strengthening grass-roots health centres was important because there
was a growing number of cases of chronic disease as society ages.

779:	"Perhaps the top 100 big hospitals list should be scrapped; instead it's a good
idea to have a list of community hospitals offering the best service, with
patients' assessments taken into consideration," Bao said.

780:	Public health experts warned years ago that some Beijing residents were queuing
up for several hours at Peking Union Medical College Hospital just to seek
treatment for a cold.

781:	The excessive flow of patients has increased workloads for doctors and nurses,
forcing them to spend little time listening to or caring for each patient.

782:	As a result, members of the public have been complaining about hasty diagnoses
by arrogant doctors, increasing the risk of medical accidents and conflicts
between hospitals and patients.

783:	However, the government's push to divert patients to grass-roots or community
hospitals has made little progress because the public still lacks confidence in
them due to insufficient funding and staffing.

784:	One criterion, the number of
research papers published in top international journals, would steer hospitals
away from treating patients but result in more support from the government and
better promotion prospects for doctors.

785:	Researchers compiling the lists said they were based on assessments by more than
1,300 senior doctors across the country who specialised in various fields, as
well as the quantity and influence of research papers.

786:	The opinions of patients
were not a factor.

787:	That probably explains why three hospitals with strong records of scientific
research have been ranked in the top three for the three years that the rankings
have come out.

percent of patients survey saying it was low-quality.

Online rankings raise profiles of area hospitals

Oct. 27--More and more people are researching their health care options online,
local hospital officials said, and they believe that is bringing a boost to the
local economy by luring patients from out of the area.

796:	1 in Texas in overall orthopedic services for the second consecutive year
and the Physicians Centre Hospital, also in Bryan, as No.

797:	Local hospitals and HealthGrades evaluators said such rankings are important
because of an increase in the number of people who research health care options
online.

798:	"Locals should feel good
knowing a hospital rated five-star in many procedures is available in their
neighborhood."

799:	HealthGrades, the leading company for health care information, is finding an
increasing number of people nationwide are searching online for health care,
said Katherine Henschen, HealthGrades's client executive for professional
services.

800:	From January to July, 128,974 people in the Waco designated market area, which
includes Bryan and College Station, evaluated health care on the company's
website, she said.

801:	Rankings

HealthGrades ranks all hospitals in the United States that report to the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), basically all non-federal hospitals,
Henschen said.

802:	It did a statistical analysis of patient data from each hospital from the 2008
to 2010 federal fiscal years for the 2012 rankings, she said.

803:	HealthGrades also ranked St. Joseph among America's top 100 best hospitals in
the categories of overall orthopedic services, joint replacement and spine
surgery, and in the top 10 percent in the nation for treatment of stroke.

804:	The company does not rank hospitals numerically nationwide, but ranks the Top 10
for specific categories in each state.

805:	St. Joseph and Physicians Centre were the
only hospitals in Bryan and College Station to be ranked in any Top 10 lists,
Henschen said.

806:	The company also ranks hospitals with one to five stars in different categories,
with five stars being the highest ranking.

807:	She declined to say what the cost was.

808:	Researching online

College Station Medical Center spokesman Joe Brown said he believes more people
are being "choosy" with their health care options, likely because of the
Internet's accessibility, and people want to see what they're getting for the
cost and what the track records are for hospitals and doctors.

809:	"I think that people are smart consumers of health care and nowadays people will
go to greater lengths to investigate," Brown said about researching online.

810:	Brown and Sigman said their hospitals are getting an increasing number of
patients from Houston, Austin, Dallas and Fort Worth, and they believed people
looking online contribute to that.

811:	Besides spending money at the hospitals, that
means friends and family members staying at hotels and eating and shopping
locally, they said.

812:	Sigman said 15 percent of St. Joseph's joint replacement patients, on average
over the past three years, come from out of town each year, bringing $1.6
million to the hospital.

PALM COAST Florida Hospital Flagler has ranked as one of the nation's best
hospitals, according to a healthcare business information company.

815:	The hospital
was recently named one of the nation's Top 100 hospitals by Solucient in its
latest National Benchmarks for Success study.

816:	The study ranks hospitals of
similar size in four performance areas: quality of care, efficiency, financial
performance and growing community service.

817:	"This is the first time
we've made the Solucient Top 100," said Eric Stevens, vice president for
operations at the Flagler County facility.

818:	Solucient is one of
the largest and most prestigious benchmarking companies looking at hospitals."

819:	Under the category of small community hospitals, Florida Hospital Flagler
outperformed facilities of similar size on several measures.

820:	The hospital's
average length of stay was 3.63 days, 11 percent shorter than at other benchmark
hospitals.

821:	"It compares very favorably with similar hospitals
across the country."

822:	Stevens said the high ranking also gives the Flagler
facility a glimpse at how it compares with other hospitals.

823:	Stevens said
the hospital will have a plaque to hang in the front lobby and will put up a
banner announcing the ranking, but for the most part any celebrating will be
done internally with employees.

World Report

New Delhi, July 16 -- CENTRAL TEXAS For the third year in a row, Scott & White
Hospital - Temple has been named among the nation's Best Regional Hospitals
2013-14, according to U.S. News & World Report, publisher of Best Hospitals.

826:	In 2011, U.S.
News began formally recognizing hospitals outside major metropolitan areas,
including Scott & White Hospital -Temple, as Best Regional Hospitals.

827:	The latest
rankings identify more than 200 such hospitals outside metropolitan areas of one
million or more.

828:	To be listed with some of the country's
premier medical institutions is very humbling."

829:	"Only about 15
percent of hospitals are recognized for their high performance as among their
region's best.

830:	Just three percent of all hospitals earn a national ranking in
any specialty."

831:	U.S. News annually evaluates nearly 5,000 hospitals in 16 medical specialties.

832:	Data stands behind its analysis in most specialties, death rates, patient
safety, and procedure volume.

833:	Physicians' responses to a national survey, in
which specialists are asked to name hospitals they consider best in their
specialty for the toughest cases, also are factored in.

834:	The complete rankings
and methodology are available at http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals.

835:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition, or added risk because of other health problems or age.

836:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, the adequacy of nurse
staffing levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most
specialties.

For the fifth straight year, Sarasota Memorial Hospital made the best-known list
of the country's top hospitals.

838:	The magazine uses mortality data, a checklist of hospital services and a
reputation survey to analyze and rank the top 50 hospitals in 16 categories of
care.

839:	U.S. News examined 5,453 hospitals.

840:	Sarasota Memorial officials cheered the news while noting the challenges a small
hospital faces in making the cut.

841:	"Although we don't have the high visibility of some of our peers, our doctors,
nurses, researchers and staff have demonstrated that we provide the same caliber
of care you'd find in the nation's best academic medical centers," Sarasota
Memorial President Gwen MacKenzie said in a prepared statement.

842:	But it also was one of only nine hospitals that scored no points for national
reputation, dropping its ranking.

843:	This year, only two hospitals made the list without reputation points.

844:	Project editor Avery Comarow said the magazine will give out data on all
1,000-plus hospitals that qualified for the study.

to be among such an illustrious group of hospitals in the top 10," Miller said.

853:	The report reviewed the performance of hospitals in areas from complex,
high-risk cancer care to common procedures such as knee replacement surgery,
said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis at U.S. News & World Report.

854:	The data is meant to help patients make informed decisions about where they seek
care, he said.

855:	Hopkins also ranked among the top three hospitals nationwide in five
specialties: gastroenterology, neurology and neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
rheumatology, and ear, nose and throat.

856:	While some rankings can be important, Miller said that it's what Hopkins'
patients think that matters the most.

857:	Karen Lancaster, a spokeswoman for the University of Maryland Medical Center,
said, "We recognize how fortunate the people of this region are to have two
strong research-focused academic medical centers to go to for care."

Ochsner Among 25 Hospitals in America Nationally Ranked in 11 Or More
Specialties Accd'ing to U.S. News

LENGTH: 669  words


New Delhi, July 17 -- Ochsner Medical Center and Ochsner Medical Center - West
Bank Campus are among only 25 hospitals in the country to rank in the top 50 in
11 or more medical specialties, according to U.S. News & World Report's 2012-13
Best Hospitals rankings.

859:	Fewer than 150 of the country's roughly 5,000 hospitals are nationally ranked;
Ochsner earned national rankings in 11 of the 12 data-driven medical
specialties.

860:	The rankings are based on a comprehensive evaluation of hard data,
such as patient survival rates, patient safety data, nurse staffing, patient
services and available technology, in addition to a reputational score based on
surveyed physicians.

861:	The hospital rankings, said U.S. News Health Rankings Editor Avery Comarow, are
like a GPS-type aid to help steer patients to hospitals with strong skills in
the procedures and medical conditions that present the biggest challenges.

862:	"All
of these hospitals are the kinds of medical centers that should be on your list
when you need the best care," said Comarow.

863:	"They are where other hospitals send
the toughest cases."

864:	"These rankings
are the most comprehensive national evaluation of hospitals and their clinical
programs completed by any third party independent organization."

865:	"Rankings such as these are extremely helpful in enabling patients to find the
best," said Dr. Joseph Bisordi, Chief Medical Officer of Ochsner Health System.

866:	"While we are always focused on opportunities to improve, we are very proud that
our relentless focus on quality throughout the system has led to continued and
consistent advancements in our patients' outcomes, which is reflected in the
U.S. News rankings," said Michael Hulefeld, CEO of Ochsner Medical Center.

March 06--Decatur Morgan Hospital officials are fighting to hold on to a Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama ranking that would save patients hundreds of
dollars in co-payments.

874:	BCBS, which is the state's largest health insurance provider, downgraded the
hospital from Tier 1 to Tier 2.

875:	This means most co-pays for most services will
double.

876:	KoKo Mackin, vice president of communications and community relations for BCBS,
said she could not comment on the 2016 tier results because they are
communicating them to affected hospitals.

877:	BCBS rolled out the three-tier system in 2009, and in an interview with The
Decatur Daily at the time, Mackin said the objective was better patient care and
a financial safety system that includes reimbursement amounts.

878:	The new grading system required hospitals to agree to lower reimbursement rates
for patient service.

879:	It also created new co-pay amounts for inpatient and
outpatient services, depending on the hospital's tier ranking.

880:	The co-pay for outpatient surgery at a Tier 1 hospital, for example, is $200,
while the co-pay is $400 at a Tier 2 or Tier 3 hospital.

881:	BCBS said hospitals in the "tiered network" program are evaluated annually on
fiscal awareness, quality, patient safety and patient experience.

882:	The Parkway campus, which is used primarily for OBGYN services, is set to go
under the Tier 2 ranking.

883:	Hayes said the facilities have an average combined
census of between 130 and 135 patients per day.

884:	The Huntsville Hospital Health Systems has 18 sites and seven acute-care
hospitals, and Decatur Morgan would be the only site with a Tier 2 ranking.

A dozen St. Louis area hospitals score A's in safety ranking

Missouri's statewide ranking for hospital safety rose this year to 20th in the
nation from 26th last fall, while neighboring Illinois' dipped to 23rd this year
from 15th last fall, according to a new report by an independent nonprofit group
focused on health care.

901:	The report, released Wednesday by The Leapfrog Group, assigned grades to
hospitals across the country for patient safety and then ranked states based on
the percentage of their hospitals that earned A's.

902:	In Missouri, 22 of the 59 hospitals graded, or 37.3 percent, received A's.

903:	In
Illinois, 38 of the 113 hospitals graded, or 33.6 percent, received A's.

904:	No
hospital in Missouri or Illinois received an F.

Leapfrog calculates hospitals' grades based on a number of measures, including
the rates of hospital-associated infections, patient falls, accidental punctures
and lacerations, deaths from treatable complications after surgery and physician
staffing in intensive care units, among others.

905:	To see individual hospitals'
grades, go to www.hospitalsafetygrade.org.

906:	Danny Chun, a spokesman for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, said
patients shouldn't put too much stock in any one rating or ranking.

907:	He called
Leapfrog's overall ranking a "crude measure" of hospital safety.

908:	"We welcome information that can help consumers make decisions, but as always we
recommend consumers and patients not rely on any one source of data or report,
that they look at multiple sources, multiple reports and obviously talk to your
doctor," Chun said.

909:	He noted that there were many reports and rankings of hospitals done by a number
of different groups, all with different methodologies.

910:	"There is no gold standard or holy grail of measures yet," Chun said.

911:	A dozen hospitals in the St. Louis area received A's: Alton Memorial Hospital,
Barnes-Jewish West County, Des Peres Hospital, Mercy Hospital St. Louis, Mercy
Hospital Washington, Mercy Hospital Jefferson, Progress West (O'Fallon, Ill.),
St. Luke's (Chesterfield), SSM Health St. Joseph (both Lake Saint Louis and St.

The Fraser Institute has released a report card on Ontario hospitals that
includes the death rates from stroke, heart attack and other conditions at
institutions across the province.

914:	"The goal of this new hospital report card is to contribute to the improvement
of hospital care by providing quality of care information directly to patients
and the general public," said Mark Mullins, co-author and executive director of
the Vancouver-based think tank.

915:	The Globe and Mail was initially part of the report card project, which ranks
hospitals in the province, and planned to publish the results on its website.

916:	The think tank bought the initial data from the Canadian Institute for Health
Information, a non-profit organization that gathers and analyzes information
about health care in Canada.

917:	Only 43 of 136 acute-care hospitals in the province agreed to have
their institutions identified by name.

918:	The top two hospitals in the ranking
can't be named.

919:	Neither can the 10 bottom-ranked hospitals over the past three
years.

920:	The report card was based on more than 8.5 million patient records from 1997 to
2005, which were adjusted, Mr. Mullins said, to account for age, sex and medical
condition.

921:	In theory, this means that hospitals that treat more difficult cases - that get
all the trauma cases, for example - aren't penalized.

922:	This risk-adjustment
formula has been used to perform rankings in a number of hospitals in the United
States.

923:	The report includes 50 measures of patient safety and quality of care, although
only nine were used to rank the hospitals.

924:	Mr. Mullins said the Fraser Institute
wants to empower patients to make informed choices about their care.

925:	The overall ranking of the hospitals was compiled using what the Fraser
Institute calls the hospital mortality index, based on death rates from hip
fractures, heart attacks, congestive heart failure and other conditions.

926:	How significant are the differences
between hospitals based on their overall score?

927:	Colin MacKenzie, managing editor of news at The Globe, said the report card was
a worthwhile idea.

928:	The rankings didn't take into account success rates on surgeries like hip
replacements, or patient satisfaction.

929:	The
report didn't consider patients' socioeconomic status, an important determinant
of health, nor did it identify whether patients were in palliative care.

930:	Small hospitals can have wildly different numbers from year to year.

931:	If three
out of six stroke patients die one year, but none out of 10 the next, the stroke
mortality rate for that hospital would drop from 50 per cent to zero.

932:	All hospitals were given a chance to review the data.

933:	It is very difficult to rank hospitals, said Jennifer Zelmer, vice-president of
research and analysis at the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

934:	"Hospitals provide a wide range of services to many different types of patients
and different indicators reflect this mix.

935:	What indicators you include, how you measure them, and how you combine them can
all make a big difference to results."

936:	"No one should draw conclusions about hospitals from the report we have seen
today," said Hilary Short, OHA president and CEO.

937:	"Once again, we are honored by U.S. News' consistent recognition of the
exceptional, multidisciplinary care we offer our young cancer patients and our
ongoing commitment to research into new therapeutic avenues," said David A.
Williams, MD, president of Dana-Farber/Boston Children's and chief scientific
officer of Boston Children's Hospital.

938:	"This U.S. News ranking is testament to
the unique strength that comes from marrying a world-class cancer center with a
world-class children's hospital, leading to survival rates that are better than
the national average, despite the fact that we attract some of the most complex
cases."

939:	Dana-Farber/ Boston Children's brings together two internationally known
research and teaching institutions that have provided comprehensive care for

collaboration between physician, patient and family underscoring wellness,
education, research and care management as part of our commitment to improving
the health of the community we serve."

like a GPS-type aid to help steer patients to hospitals with strong skills in
the procedures and medical conditions that present the biggest challenges.

Sarasota Memorial Hospital again ranked among the top hospitals in the country
and outperformed all Florida hospitals in the latest U.S. News and World Report
rankings.

960:	Those university-based hospitals dominate the list, but community hospitals hold
their own.

961:	In a July 8 interview on
CNN, the magazine's health editor, Dr. Bernadine Healy, cited Sarasota as an
example of how high-quality care transfers from universities to community
hospitals.

962:	The magazine stopped ranking hospitals for geriatric care, saying primary health
care was more relevant to the field.

963:	That cost Sarasota Memorial a specialty.

964:	The magazine said its ratings are based equally on health outcome data,
reputation and care-related areas such as technology and nurse-patient ratios.

965:	The health data is from 2002 through 2004.

966:	MacKenzie said community hospitals tend to suffer because they lack the name
recognition of universities' teaching hospitals.

967:	Those university-based hospitals were Sarasota's closest in-state competition.

968:	Other Florida hospitals on the list include H. Lee Moffit Cancer Center, 11th
place for cancer, and Tampa General Hospital, 46th for orthopedics.

969:	Only 176 of 5,189 hospitals examined -- about 3 percent -- received a ranking in
one or more specialties, the magazine said.

hospitals in the country, according to 2013/2014 "Best Hospitals" rankings from
U.S. News and World Report released online Tuesday.

1069:	Several other hospitals in metro Los Angeles and the Inland Empire are also
recognized by the news magazine as being top performing in different specialty
categories.

1070:	UCLA and Cedars-Sinai, ranked 5th and 13th respectively, are among the top 18
hospitals that rank at or near the top in six specialty categories.

1071:	"We really believe if we take great care of our patients, everything else will
take care of itself," said Dr. David Feinberg, president of the UCLA Health
System and CEO of the UCLA Hospital System, adding that hospital staff strive to
ensure every patient receives technically-advanced and passionate care.

1072:	Although patients may use hospital rankings when looking for a hospital,
Feinberg said, the best recommendations come from patients who have received
care at UCLA.

1073:	Other local hospitals that were ranked in the top 50 in one or more specialty
categories are: Keck Hospital of USC in Los Angeles, UC Irvine Medical Center in
Orange County, Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, City of Hope in Duarte,
Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach and USC Norris Cancer
Hospital in L.A.

1074:	The purpose of the rankings is to help patients who need a demanding surgery and
whose care may be affected by age or a chronic condition, according to Avery
Comarow, the magazine's health rankings editor,

As many as 2 million patients require a surgery or care that is technically
challenging or has an increased risk of death or harm, according to Comarow.

1075:	From a pool of about 5,000 hospitals nationwide, 1,894 hospitals were eligible
to be part of the specialty rankings.

1076:	A survey where doctors are asked to name hospitals they consider best in their
specialty for treating difficult cases is also factored in.

specialties.

Getting sick in New York City is a prescription for getting the best medical
care in America.

1230:	Three Manhattan hospitals are among the top 20 medical centers in the nation,
according to the 2016-17 rankings released Tuesday by U.S. News & World Report.

1231:	No other city has more than two hospitals ranked in the top 20.

1232:	"It has been our findings over many years that New York has one of the largest
populations of exceptionally good hospitals," said Ben Harder, chief of health
analysis at U.S. News & World Report.

1233:	"We've got two great medical schools in Columbia and Weill Cornell that give us
terrific doctors, terrific faculty," Corwin said.

1234:	Completing the trifecta among city medical centers making it in the top 20 in
the nation was Mount Sinai Hospital.

1235:	The Upper East Side medical center scored the No.

1236:	The rankings were based on an evaluation of 4,553 hospitals in the U.S.

Factors used to compile the lists include survival rates, nurse-to-patient
ratios, safety procedures, complications and the reputation of specialists.

1237:	Reflecting on the performance of the top city hospitals, Harder emphasized how
well they scored in the medical specialties.

1238:	"There are only 150 hospitals that can claim even one national ranking."

1239:	Several other New York-area medical centers also outperformed the vast majority
across the country.

1240:	Other city stars in the national rankings include what U.S. News & World Report
refers to as specialty hospitals: the Hospital for Special Surgery, which ranked
No.

Medicare releases controversial quality rankings

BYLINE: Austin Ramsey, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.

1242:	SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 876 words


July 29--Newly released Medicare quality and performance ratings give Owensboro
Health Regional Hospital three out of five stars this week, putting the
acute-care medical facility in line with most state and national averages.

1243:	OHRH ranked below the national average in patient experience and efficient use
of medical imaging.

1244:	On a Medicare survey asking patients about their care experiences, the hospital
did not meet any state or federal benchmarks, something of which executive
officials with Owensboro Health said they have been aware.

1245:	Past results have yielded unfavorable
results, said Debbie Bostic, chief operations officer and chief nursing officer
at OH.

1246:	The health system, however, has acted quickly, she added, to develop a
series of hospital-wide teams charged with addressing problems in each HCAHPS
domain.

1247:	They exclude more
recent developments the health system has made toward improving internal
experiences and communication.

1248:	He doesn't want the public to think
the health system is making excuses for dissatisfactory results.

1249:	"If anybody is concerned about it, our leadership is because we know we provide
better care than most of the hospitals out there," he said.

1250:	Further analysis, hospital officials
said, is also needed to determine exactly what the percentage use of medical
imaging actually measures.

1251:	The hospital has somewhat reshaped its emergency department to better serve
patients.

1252:	According to Medicare standards, OHRH emergency service volume is
"very high" at more than 60,000 patients annually.

1253:	With so many patients,
Strahan said the new hospital emergency room adjusts its staffing according to
live patient value.

1254:	ED units, he said, are equipped with mid-level providers who
can act as preliminary screeners in serious cases, taking pressure from other
doctors.

1255:	Patients at the hospital spend an average 3.7 hours in the ED -- almost
three-quarters below the national average for high-volume patient hospitals.

1256:	Many national
health care experts and members of Congress have been working to block the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid from publishing the rankings.

1257:	They say the
numbers, which measure things like death and infection rates, along with patient
reviews, fail to take into account specialized hospitals and regional health
care markets in poorer areas.

1258:	Indeed, the way certain hospitals were ranked is puzzling parts of the industry
this week.

1259:	Medicare bestowed only 3 percent of the nation's hospitals with
five-star ratings, and many top medical centers, like the Cleveland Clinic,
Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford Health Care, fell short of that
mark.

1260:	Meanwhile, lesser-known hospitals scattered around the country earned the
five-start status.

1261:	Regionally, only a handful of medical centers earned anything above three stars.

1262:	Methodist Hospital in Henderson, Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center in
Leitchfield and The Heart and Women's hospitals at Deaconess Gateway Hospital in
Newburgh, Indiana, all received four stars from the Medicare rankings, and
Memorial Hospital and Health Care Center in Jasper, Indiana, was the only
hospital within a 200-mile radius to earn five.

Oct. 16--A Golden, Colo., company that has established a Web site ranking
hospitals, includes Muskogee Regional Medical Center, which was given mixed
results, depending on the category.

1264:	Seventeen eastern Oklahoma hospitals
rated three stars for both survival and recovery.

1265:	--In gastrointestinal surgeries and procedures, MRMC rated three stars, as did
the other nine hospitals listed in that category.

1266:	All other 13 eastern Oklahoma hospitals rated three
stars.

1267:	These are samples; other procedures and diseases are included on the site.

1268:	"For
too long, consumers have not had good comparative information on health care
providers.

1269:	While we are in the first stages of that, and it will get better, it
is a good first step.

1270:	I think it's the beginning of even greater transparency in
health care."

1271:	Mahan said he's not worried about grading or ranking of hospitals hurting MRMC.

1272:	"As this information becomes more prevalent, I think consumers will use it more,
and yes, it could start affecting health care decisions," he said.

1273:	It's to protect the consumer and to reward
those who are providing high quality health care."

1274:	Mahan said hospitals located in higher socio-economic areas where people take
better care of themselves are likely to score higher.

1275:	For hospitals, the company utilizes information management and
statistical techniques to process and risk-adjust a large volume of patient
level data.

1276:	According to the company's Web site, they risk-adjust the data in order to make
valid and accurate comparisons between providers, taking into account that the
demographic characteristics of patients and the severity of patients' illnesses
may vary at different locations.

1277:	This levels the playing field, for example,
between hospitals that treat sicker patients compared to those that treat
healthier patients, information on the Web site states.

LENGTH: 460  words


New Delhi, July 16 -- Mercy Health, which provides quality care with compassion
in your neighborhood through its network of care, announces that U.S. News and
World Report has named The Jewish Hospital -- Mercy Health among the best
hospitals in Ohio for the second year running.

1280:	"This recognition underscores
the great care we provide across a wide spectrum of health concerns and I share
this honor with everyone at The Jewish Hospital who made it possible."

1281:	The hospital also boasts a premier total joint center
and the services of some of the city's leading sports medicine experts.

1282:	The annual U.S. News Best Hospitals rankings, now in their 24th year, recognize
hospitals that excel in treating the most challenging patients.

1283:	It evaluates

1284:	"Only about 15
percent of hospitals are recognized for their high performance as among their

1285:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition or added risk because of other health problems or age.

1286:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, the adequacy of nurse
staffing levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most
specialties.

1288:	U-M is one of only eight hospitals in the nation to make the honor
roll every year since 1995.

1289:	U-M is the only hospital in Michigan on the national honor roll, which signifies

1290:	"As the only hospital that serves patients from every county in Michigan, and

care and expertise across many specialties," says Doug Strong, M.B.A., director
and chief executive officer of the U-M Hospitals and Health Centers.

1291:	"There are

www.uofmhealth.org/quality, where U-M offers data about the quality and safety
of a wide range of operations and other types of care.

1293:	Such measures form the
basis for part of the U.S. News ranking, but the U-M site goes far beyond the
publicly available data that rankings are based on.

1294:	The U-M Hospitals and Health Centers are part of the U-M Health System, which
also has been recognized by U.S. News as having one of the nation's top medical
schools - tied for 10th in the country -- and top children's hospitals, with
C.S.

nation's most integrated health systems, encompassing a broad range of services
for patients of all types.

1297:	The U-M Health System benefits by being part of a university with strong

nursing, social work, engineering, business and law.

Several area hospitals rank among the best in Ohio for patient care, according
to a U.S. News & World Report ranking.

1311:	The annual rankings showed Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton ranked highest among
local hospitals, showing up at No.

1312:	23 on the list of the best hospitals for
treating pulmonary disorders, or diseases involving the respiratory tract.

1313:	In addition to Miami Valley, three other hospitals in the Dayton-based Premier
Health network - Atrium Medical Center, Good Samaritan Hospital and Upper Valley
Medical Center - also ranked as high-performing in at least one area of care.

1314:	"We're proud of the significant strides that all of our hospitals are making in
elevating Premier Health's high-quality care to the next level," says Mary
Boosalis, Premier Health's president.

1315:	Kettering Medical Center, a member of the Kettering Health Network chain of
hospitals, was the next highest-ranked local hospital in Ohio, placing 17th out
of 215 hospitals in the state.

1316:	U.S. News' best hospitals methodologies include patient survival, the number of
times a given procedure is performed, infection rates and adequacy of nurse
staffing.

1317:	But the rankings are also based on the opinions of doctors, which
count for nearly a third (27.5 percent) of the U.S. rankings score.

1318:	Last week, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services released its Hospital
Compare report, which showed Ohio Valley Surgical Hospital in Springfield was
the only hospital in the Miami Valley to earn the top score in the government's
five-star rating system for patient care.

1370:	The entire Parkview team -- employees, physicians,
volunteers and board of directors -- all played a role in enhancing patient
experiences which ultimately has led to Parkview being recognized nationally for
our efforts," said Parkview President and CEO Mike Baxter.

1371:	U.S. News Health Rankings Editor Avery Comarow said in a news release that the
rankings can be used to help steer patients to hospitals with strong skills in
the procedures and medical conditions that present the biggest challenges.

1372:	"All of these hospitals are the kinds of medical centers that should be on your
list when you need the best care," said Comarow.

1373:	"They are where other hospitals
send the toughest cases."

1374:	"As we worked to improve the local economy this story sends a great message that
folks do not need to drive north for health care and in fact, according to U.S.
News, this would not be a good decision," Baxter said.

1375:	Baxter said the recognition is a reflection of hard work among all Parkview
employees and associates, but he singled out "the front line staff."

1376:	The magazine's complete hospital rankings and methodology are available at
www.health.usnews.com/ best-hospitals.

1377:	The publication's rankings of "best hospitals", done in the 52 metropolitan
areas with the highest populations, have become widely watched by the health
care industry and consumers.

of criteria ranging from outcomes to reputation and quality in a wide range of
specialties.

1379:	To be ranked in its area, hospitals had to score in the top 25 percent among its
peers in at least one of 16 medical specialties.

1380:	"All of these hospitals provide first-rate care for the majority of patients,
even those with serious conditions or who need demanding procedures," says
Health Rankings Editor Avery Comarow.

1381:	"It is gratifying to know that a third-party evaluation has put Stony Brook
University Medical Center in the top 10 hospitals in the New York metropolitan
region," said Stony Brook University Medical Center CEO Dr. Steven L.
Strongwater.

1382:	"This validates the great effort put forth by our faculty, nurses
and staff to provide a consistent level of high quality care to our patients. "

metropolitan area led by New York Presbyterian University Hospital Columbia and
Cornell.

1385:	Mortality rate and reputation among physicians as the best in their specialty
for the most challenging cases and procedures each account for 32.5 percent of a
score.

1386:	Meanwhile, measures related to quality of care, such as patient volume and
nursing care, account for 30 percent.

1387:	Patient safety, which the magazine described as success in protecting patients
from accidents and medical errors, accounted for only 5 percent.

1388:	1 hospital in a metro area is not necessarily the best in town for all
patients," according to an article on the magazine's website.

may outshine it in various specialties. "

Report

LENGTH: 290  words


New Delhi, Sept. 21 -- U.S. News & World Report released its annual "Best
Hospitals" rankings this week and named Englewood Hospital and Medical Center a
Best Regional Hospital, ranking the Medical Center #5 in New Jersey and #18 in
the New York metropolitan area.

1412:	This year's "Best Hospitals," the 23rd annual edition, showcases more than 720
of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals.

1413:	Fewer than 150 are nationally ranked in
at least one of 16 medical specialties.

1414:	Additionally, Englewood
Hospital scored high in patient safety, demonstrating its ongoing commitment to
reducing accidents and medical mistakes.

1415:	"We are proud to earn this 'Best Hospital' distinction and to be recognized

Maine Medical Center is among the nation's 50 best hospitals for orthopedics and
heart care and surgery, according to U.S. News and World Report.

1421:	The ranking evaluated 5,462
hospitals in 16 specialties.

1422:	Only 173 hospitals met the standards in one or more
specialties.

1423:	Military and veterans hospitals were not included because the
needed data was not available.

1424:	Mortality rates, nurse staffing ratios and the availability of advanced services
figured largely for both of Maine Med's rankings, hospital officials said.

1425:	The
availability of related patient services figured in the heart ranking,

The ratings were made available on U.S. News and World Report's Web site on
Friday and will be in the magazine issue that will be available Monday.

1426:	For most categories, including the
orthopedics and heart categories, the first hurdle was membership in the Council
of Teaching Hospitals, affiliation with a medical school or the availability of
certain advanced services.

1427:	Only a quarter of the hospitals met those criteria.

1428:	Other considerations were whether the hospital treated a minimum number of
Medicare inpatients with certain conditions and whether the hospital ranked
among the best in a specialty in physician surveys.

New rankings released by Consumer Reports magazine reviewing patient

California medical facilities.

1430:	At the same time, two area hospitals languish at the bottom of the list,
according to the rankings.

1431:	Compared with other hospitals in Ventura, San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Orange and Los Angeles counties, Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in
Whittier ranked fourth with an 83 consumer rating - first overall in Los Angeles
County.

1433:	The facility has the only

patient satisfaction high isn't easy, volunteer and Customer Services Director
Priscilla Gamb said.

1434:	"It is a challenge (to maintain patient satisfaction)," Gamb said.

1435:	The rankings are based on a quarterly federal survey of more than 1 million
hospital patients across the nation, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS.

1436:	The survey asks patients about recent hospital experiences regarding doctor and
nurse communication, cleanliness and noise in hospital rooms, and discharge
information and medication.

1437:	Since she came on, Snyder has tried to address trouble areas, specifically
communication between nurses and patients, Ternes said.

Sarasota Memorial Hospital has improved its national ranking in the latest U.S.
News & World Report survey of "best hospitals," collecting the fifth-highest
overall score in the state and the highest for Southern Florida.

1440:	No other Southwest Florida hospital made the Top 50 lists that cover 16 medical
specialties, or was cited as performing as well in any specialty.

1441:	Because the publication is not part of the health care industry, its rankings --
which rely on data that includes patient survival and nurse staffing levels --
are considered more prestigious than other annual reviews.

1442:	The publisher says they are intended to guide patients who need the highest
available level of care because of challenging conditions.

1443:	No Florida hospitals made the "honor roll" of 17 leading hospitals
nationwide.

1444:	1 among Florida's 265 hospitals is Florida Hospital Orlando, with Tampa
General Hospital in second place.

1445:	The hospital has been ranked 38th among children's hospitals by the National
Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions.

1446:	The
magazine carries stories about children's fashion, health, safety, education and
nutrition.

1447:	38 might not seem weighty enough to merit bells and whistles, but a total of
116 hospitals were surveyed.

1448:	Of the more than 250 children's hospitals in the country, "only a certain
portion of them even qualify to receive a survey," said Karen Cicero, senior
editor at Child Magazine, and author of an article in the current issue that
describes the rankings.

1449:	"If you think of it in terms of the total number of children's hospitals in the
country, it's even more impressive," she said.

1450:	It's actually driven by data," said Dr. Phil
Fischer, medical director of Eugenio Litta.

1451:	Staff at the children's hospital
would, of course, like to highlight something closer to the top of the list.

1452:	"We really care more about taking care of patients than we do about things like
rankings," Fischer said.

1453:	According to Cicero, that focus on patient care is one of the reasons Mayo
ranked higher than 78 out of the other 115 children's hospitals surveyed
nationwide.

1454:	"It's a good step forward for Children's Hospital, and we're thrilled to be
ranked as favorably as we were," he said.

1478:	On Tuesday, a number of health care systems quickly touted their rankings on the
U.S. News listings.

1479:	About 3 percent of the nearly 5,000 hospitals that were
analyzed earned national ranking in one specialty.

1480:	And high-ranking hospitals
quickly touted this as a badge of honor.

1481:	Also, five hospitals within the Downers Grove-based Advocate Health Care system
were among the top 25 hospitals in the area: Advocate Christ Medical Center in
Oak Lawn at No.

1482:	Among suburban hospitals, Cadence Health-Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield
ranked No.

1483:	It is difficult to determine if high rankings on such a list would eventually
translate into financial gain for the hospitals.

1484:	"Over the past five years, we've see more patients coming in with a better
understanding of patient safety and quality care," Wilk said.

1485:	The hospital uses such rankings to focus on what they're doing well and what
they can do even better, especially with best practices and reliability of the
system, said Wilk.

1486:	The listing "reflects the dedication and teamwork of our physicians, nurses,
other medical professionals and associates, who are committed to consistently
delivering advanced, high-quality care to the patients and communities we
serve," Mark A. Frey, president and chief executive officer of Alexian Brothers
Health System said in a statement.

1487:	Advocate Lutheran General also viewed the U.S. News ranking as a boost of
confidence in the community and not something that could lead to financial gain,
said President Rick Floyd.

1488:	"It's hard to know if patients come here based on the survey.

1489:	"But there are a
number of these rankings and they provide more and more data, and that just
helps promote more confidence and trust when consumers are faced with serious
health issues.

1491:	The rankings come out in the weekly newsmagazine's July 23 issue.

1492:	Overall, St. John's Hospital Cancer Institute ranked 44 out of the top 50
hospitals in the United States for cancer care, according to the magazine.

1493:	In general, however, the magazine's
reporters studied data from 6,116 hospitals nationwide.

1494:	To be eligible for ranking, hospitals must either belong to the Council of
Teaching Hospitals, be affiliated with a medical school or have at least nine of
17 technology services for treating cancer, according to St. John's.

1495:	Those criteria narrowed the field of candidate hospitals to 1,878 this year.

1496:	From that group, the magazine chose 168 hospitals that treat cancer in 17
specialty areas.

1497:	The top five cancer hospitals in the United States, according to U.S. News &
World Report, are the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City;
the University of Texas, M.D.

1498:	The 828-bed facility was ranked among the top 50 hospitals in seven different
medical specialties.

1499:	"It puts us at the top of the list for community hospitals," said Dr. Bruce
Fleegler, Sarasota Memorial's chief medical officer.

1500:	Hospital officials credited SMH's doctors, nurses and staff for the high
rankings.

1501:	The magazine looked at 17 specialties at 6,007 medical centers across the
country.

1502:	The rankings are based on a hospital's reputation, mortality rate and
care-related factors such as nursing and patient services.

1503:	The listings include the 50 highest scoring hospitals in each specialty.

1504:	Other Florida hospitals making the list: Tampa General Hospital, the Bascom
Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Hospital in Orlando, the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in
Tampa and St. Vincent's Medical Center in Jacksonville.

Huntsman ranked 47th in nation for cancer hospitals

LENGTH: 541 words


By Daphne Chen

Deseret News

SALT LAKE CITY - Huntsman Cancer Institute made the list of top 50 cancer
hospitals in a national ranking of medical facilities released by U.S. News &
World Report on Tuesday.

1506:	Although none of Utah's medical facilities cracked the U.S. News & World
Report's "honor roll" of the nation's top 20 hospitals, University Hospital was
named the No.

1507:	"Cancer touches the lives of everyone, and this recognition reflects our efforts
to relieve the burden of this disease on our patients and their families through
excellent patient care and robust scientific research," Beckerle said in a
statement.

1508:	Jill Vicory, spokeswoman at the Utah Hospital Association, cautioned that
patients should use the rankings as just one of many tools when choosing a
health care provider.

1509:	"We
encourage consumers to talk with their physicians, consider their insurance
coverage as well as take quality and other measures into consideration when
making a decision on the right health care provider to fit their needs."

1510:	"Hospitals are evaluated across a wide range of conditions and procedures," the
organization wrote on an FAQ accompanying the rankings.

1511:	"Within that range,
hospitals can and do perform differently.

1512:	In pulmonology, for example, a
hospital might rank below another one but do better at treating patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

1513:	Another set of hospital ratings released by the federal government last week
seemed to contradict the U.S. News & World Report rankings at times.

1514:	Dixie Regional Medical Center, University of Utah Health Care and LDS Hospital
were among 14 hospitals in the state that received four out of five stars.

1515:	Some hospital administrators and health care organizations criticized the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' methodology as unfair to hospitals
that care for the sickest patients or teach medical students.

BEST HOSPITAL?

1517:	F-1

LENGTH: 671 words


You've seen the placard on the side of Port Authority buses: UPMC makes U.S.
News and World Report's honor roll of best hospitals.

1518:	Lebanon among
America's top 100 hospitals.

1519:	Impressive as the rankings sound, a Johns Hopkins researcher said those lists
and others like them can confuse patients as well as steer them to the "best"
hospital.

1520:	J. Matthew Austin and colleagues from Harvard, Vanderbilt and two California
medical centers analyzed four of lists of the nation's top medical centers and
found that no hospital earned a "high performer" designation in all four lists
and only three of the near-6,000 hospitals in America made it onto three of the
lists.

1521:	The report did not name the hospitals.

1522:	The problem, Mr. Austin said, is that each ranking uses different criteria and
methodologies, "often creating the paradox of hospitals' simultaneously being
considered best and worst depending on the rating system used."

1523:	Leapfrog and Consumer Reports ratings, for example, emphasize safety, while
HealthGrades focus on quality and U.S. News ranks hospitals based on which are
the "best medical centers for the most difficult patients" among larger centers.

1524:	Truven Health Analytics, which named St. Clair one of America's top 100
hospitals for the third time in 2014, was not part of the analysis.

1525:	Truven,
formerly Thomson Reuters, rates hospitals based on data for a number of factors,
from mortality and readmission rates to operating profit.

1526:	Robert Morris University health care expert Stephen Foreman likes the U.S. News
approach of evaluating 16 specialties, as it provides information on individual
services.

1527:	But, he added, "I've always worried about the rankings.

1528:	You present them as if
one hospital is like another, and hospitals are all so darn different that it's
almost impossible to come up with anything decent."

1529:	Mr. Foreman knows how hard it is to compare hospitals because he has tried.

1530:	Years ago, he served on the board of a health insurance startup in Philadelphia
that tried to rank that region's hospitals for quality and cost.

1531:	Because routine procedures could be done at less-costly non-research facilities,
"we didn't want people going to Penn for appendectomies," he said,

After six months of research, though, he said the differences and complexities
both between hospitals and within hospitals were so great, "I'm not sure what we
came up with was worth the effort."

1532:	The U.S. News rankings are the oldest and probably best known, and the Health
Affairs paper notes that some research has found a link between the U.S. News
"best hospitals" in a lower 30-day patient death rate.

1551:	Families can look up the new rankings and detailed information about each

1552:	In the 2015 16 rankings, 83 hospitals were ranked in at least one specialty.

1553:	Twelve hospitals were named to the "Honor Roll" a distinction awarded to
pediatric centers that provide especially high quality care in three or more
specialties.

1554:	Two other local systems ranked in the list of the "Top 100 Integrated Systems":
Columbia/HCA Healthcare's Georgia operation ranked No.

1555:	The rankings, done by SMG Marketing Group for Hospitals & Health Networks
magazine, scored local systems on six categories: financial performance;
admissions and occupancy rates; integration of decision-making; service areas;
number of physicians; and managed-care contracting.

1556:	Promina, Columbia and Emory all scored well on financial figures and breadth of
facilities and services, Steve Lenz of Chicago-based SMG, a consulting and
information company, said Wednesday.

1557:	Its hospitals include Piedmont, Gwinnett Medical Center, Cobb
and Kennestone hospitals, DeKalb Medical Center and Southern Regional Medical

1558:	Promina was listed with 1996 hospital patient revenues of $ 984 million and net

A second opinion: Best hospitals in Illinois, according to U.S. News and World
Report

BYLINE: Caitlin Wilson, Reboot Illinois

SECTION: NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS

LENGTH: 982 words


July 15--In June, we told you about Consumer Reports' list of best hospitals in
Illinois, but when it comes to your health, it never hurts to get a second
opinion.

1565:	U.S. News & World Report has released their 2014 list of the top
hospitals around the country, and it varies from the Consumer Reports list.

1566:	Other Illinois hospitals also were nationally ranked as top 10
hospitals in specialized fields: Rush University Medical Center was named number
six for orthopedics and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago was named number
one for rehabilitation.

1567:	Here are the best hospitals in Illinois, according to U.S. News and World Report
(some are tied which is why you see multiple numbers repeated):

1.

1568:	Unlike the Consumer Reports list, the U.S. News rankings list most of Illinois'
top hospitals in the Chicago area.

1569:	Some hospitals do overlap high on the best-of lists: Cadence
Health-Central Dupage Hospital, Advocate Lutheran General Hospital and St.
Alexius Medical Center all appear in both rankings.

1570:	But mostly, hospitals
mentioned by one list are not mentioned by the other.

1571:	The U.S. News and World Reports list ranks the best hospitals in the state,
while the Consumer Reports list ranked the safest.

1572:	According to U.S. News, they
compiled their list of best-of hospitals:

based mostly on death rates for patients who represent especially challenging
cases, on patient safety and on other measures of performance that can be
assessed using hard data.

1573:	An annual reputational survey of physicians, who are
asked to name hospitals they consider the best in their specialty for difficult
cases, is also factored in.

1574:	The hospitals are also rated on number of specialty areas and their reputations.

1575:	This list ranked the largest hospitals in the country (with 100 or more beds) or
hospitals that were teaching hospitals/affiliated with medical schools.

1576:	Statistics that informed the rankings came from the federal Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services' MedPAR data and the American Hospital Association and was
based on criteria such as death rates, general patient safety number of patients
at any one time and the balance of nurses and patients, reputation among
specialists and availability of proven technologies.

1577:	Children's hospitals were ranked separately as there are far fewer in the
nation.

1578:	The Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago was listed as
the top children's hospital in Illinois.

1582:	Of the 176 medical centers that are ranked in this year's edition of America's

1591:	To encourage healthy competition and promote innovation in improving

relation to their learning gains.

1592:	Measuring student progress with provincial standardized tests in reading,
writing and mathematics is critical as these skills represent a core
responsibility of the public school system.

1593:	Schools also have a responsibility to work with families and the
community to develop in students a sense of self worth and personal initiative
and to prepare students for post-secondary education and the job market.

1594:	The

examining school performance across these broader goals but was dropped in 2002,
partly because of concerns that it had become too bureaucratic.

1595:	In today's world, education has become a major determinant of a nation's social

extent, by our willingness to reach the 20 per cent of children who are not
succeeding.

July 15 -- The annual survey of American hospitals puts U-M in the national top

from joint disorders, cancer and eye conditions to heart disease, kidney failure
and ear, nose and throat complaints.

1597:	This year, only 144 of the thousands of hospitals across the country earned even

Low safety ratings worry area hospitals

BYLINE: Madeline Buxton, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1034 words


July 13--Directly next to the University of Toledo Medical Center's main
entrance is a large banner proudly announcing the hospital's ranking as number
one in the region, according to a U.S. News and World Report from July, 2011.

1602:	It's a safe bet there won't be a banner proclaiming the hospital's safety rating
in the August, 2012, issue of Consumer Reports: out of 107 ranked Ohio
hospitals, UT Medical Center, the former Medical College of Ohio, was last with
a score of 28 out of 100.

1603:	More than half of the study's rated hospitals
-- a total of 1,159 in the United States -- received a score below 50.

1604:	"My guess is that they are rushing into [this field of ranking hospitals] to
jump on a bandwagon," said Dr. Lloyd Jacobs, the president of the University of
Toledo.

1605:	"We take this really seriously, but at the same time my impression is
that they did a sloppy job of dealing with the data."

1606:	While Consumer Reports has been rating hospitals on individual criteria, such as
hospital-contracted infections and patient satisfaction since 2008, this is the
first year that the magazine, published by the nonprofit Consumers' Union, has
come up with composite safety scores for hospitals, said Tildy La Farge,
communications counsel at Consumer Reports.

1607:	Although the report is intended as a means for patients to compare various
institutions, officials at UT Medical Center said that the small number of
hospitals represented in the rankings make such comparisons difficult -- 80
percent of hospitals in the United States could not be ranked because of a lack
of available information.

1608:	The data upon which rankings were based came from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, information reported to states from
hospitals, and the Leapfrog Group, which provides its own hospital safety
scores.

1609:	"Unlike what Consumer Reports does for washing machines and automobiles and
other things, they have, to use their word, 'scraped' the data from other
publicly reported sources," said Dr. Jeffrey Gold, the chancellor, executive
vice president for biosciences and health affairs, and dean of the college of
medicine and life sciences at the UT Medical Center.

1610:	Among its concerns with the accuracy of measurements used for the rankings, UT
Medical Center cited small sample sizes, which Dr. Gold said denoted trends
rather than significant conclusions.

1611:	He also took issue with the study's
re-admission rates, which he said included patients who come back to the
hospital for staged procedures, which are common in orthopedics, cancer care,
and those suffering from coronary artery disease.

1612:	Dr. Gold also argued that the report doesn't account for varying levels of
complexity in care -- 50 percent or more of the patients seen at UT Medical
Center are referred or transferred from other hospitals that "don't want to care
for those higher-risk patients."

1613:	"I want to know how
we're doing compared to hospitals that provide services of the same complexity
we provide."

1614:	John Palmer, a spokesman for the Ohio Hospital Association, said that when
considering hospital care, patients should be careful not to place too much
stake in one ranking system.

1615:	Mr. Palmer's view was seconded by those hospitals that ranked more highly in the
Consumer Reports study, who said their work in improving patient safety is far
from done.

1616:	Administrators at ProMedica Hospitals in Lucas County -- Flower, which received
a score of 65, and Toledo Hospital, which received a score of 64 -- also found
that as a whole, the state of Ohio has a ways to go in improving patient safety.

1617:	"None of the hospitals in the state did wonderful," said Kevin Webb, the
president of Toledo Hospital.

1618:	"We
think this is a good start," said Dr. John Santa, the director of the health
rating center at Consumer Reports.

1619:	For his part, Dr. Gold doesn't believe that applications to the medical school
will decline and remains hopeful that patients won't view the hospital
differently as the result of one ranking.

1620:	"If this does defer students to other institutions, if this does defer patients
to less safe institutions, if this does have a negative impact on this
community, it would be the greatest tragedy of all," he said.

Gundersen, Mayo-Franciscan in top 15 Wisconsin hospitals on U.S. News list

BYLINE: Mike Tighe, La Crosse Tribune, Wis.

1622:	SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 527 words


July 16--La Crosse's two major medical centers are ranked in the top 15 of
Wisconsin out of 152 hospitals statewide on U.S. News and World Report's annual
America's Best Hospitals list.

1623:	They also are tabbed as the top
two out of 16 hospitals in southwest Wisconsin.

1624:	Gundersen received that designation for its gynecology and urology services,
while Mayo-Franciscan was lauded for its urology services.

1625:	Michael Richards, Gundersen's executive director of external affairs, said, "At
Gundersen, we strive to provide the best care for every patient and to improve
the health and well-being of the communities we serve in Wisconsin, Minnesota
and Iowa.

1626:	"Whether it is a U.S. News and World Report ranking today or a Healthgrades top
hospital ranking tomorrow, we strive every day to be the best for our patients."

1627:	We continue to be diligent when
reviewing processes that improve clinical quality and patient safety."

1628:	The magazine's website noted that the findings, available at
http://health.usnews.com/, don't necessarily mean that a hospital is the best
choice for individual care.

1629:	"Each specialty ranking evaluates hospitals according to their performance
across a wide range of conditions and procedures," the website cautioned.

1630:	The results should be viewed as a starting point, but patients should consult
their physicians for the best options in each case, it advised.

Fox Chase Cancer Center Ranked 19th Among the Nation's Top 50 Hospitals for
Cancer Care by U.S. News & World Report

LENGTH: 235  words


July 15 -- Fox Chase Cancer Center has been ranked 19th among the nation's top
50 hospitals for cancer care in U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals
2014-2015 rankings.

1632:	The U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals rankings are published online
annually in July, showcasing the best of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals.

1633:	The national rankings evaluate hospitals strengths in 16 adult specialties.

1634:	In
most specialties, it ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals and recognizes other
high-performing hospitals that provide care at nearly the level of their
nationally ranked peers.

1635:	Among the other factors
considered are types of facilities available, specific services offered, patient
safety measures, Magnet nursing status, and selected outcomes metrics.

Expect a Federal Express package, reporters at dozens of newspapers across the
country were told.

1637:	Expect an important fax, public-relations types at big hospitals across the
country were told.

1638:	Thus began the hoopla for the health-care industry's annual and most-hyped
championship: the release of "America's Best Hospitals," an annual ranking of
hospitals compiled by U.S. News and World Report.

1639:	On early Thursday morning last week -- four days before the magazine even would
be available on newsstands -- fax machines at 582 hospital and media sources
were cranking.

1640:	Barnes-Jewish was the only local hospital on the honor roll of 15
hospitals.

1641:	Unity Health System, parent of both, promptly put out that news in a press
release, noting that St. Luke's and St. John's were the "only two area hospitals
not directly associated with a medical school to be included in the rankings."

1642:	Though some doctors complain that what started as a legitimate consumer guide to
hospitals has turned into a public-relations bonanza, Hakes of St. Louis
University says the U.S. News rankings are valuable.

1643:	"It's interesting because these rankings are based on a lot of quantitative
data, and it's a chance for us to compare ourselves nationally with other
hospitals that are similar to us," she said.

1644:	Avery Comarow, the U.S. News editor of the "America's Best Hospitals," listing,
said the project was started 11 years ago "to give patients information they
couldn't get anywhere else when they needed the very best help available."

1645:	Almost 2,000 hospitals were considered for the rankings.

1646:	To be eligible,
hospitals had to be members of the Council of Teaching Hospitals, be affiliated
with a medical school, or provide at least nine out of 17 prescribed
technological services.

1647:	Those hospitals were then ranked based on reputation, mortality and other
factors such as technology, procedure volume and nursing care.

1648:	The reputation
analysis was based on a survey of 2,550 physicians in various specialties, while
the other data were based on government records and industry surveys.

1649:	By the way, a programming mistake meant that the first list that newspapers and
hospitals received and the same list in the issue that hit the newsstands Monday
was wrong.

1650:	The annual U.S. News Best Hospitals rankings, now in their 27th year, recognize
the nation's top 50 hospitals that excel in treating patients with the most
challenging health care needs.

1651:	U.S. News evaluates hospitals in 16 adult
specialties and ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals in 12 of those specialties
based largely on hard data.

1652:	The combined programs of Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Memorial Hospital La
Jolla - listed by the magazine as "Scripps La Jolla Hospitals and Clinics" - are
among the nation's top 50 hospitals in:

* Gynecology (No.

1653:	"These rankings are a testament
to the deep dedication and exceptional skill of our physicians, nurses and
others who are on the front lines of caring for our patients every day."

1654:	The U.S. News rankings are the latest in a series of recent accolades earned by
Scripps hospitals.

1655:	Last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
gave Scripps Green and Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla a five-star ranking
for quality, making them the only hospitals in the region with the highest
distinction and among only 3 percent in the nation to earn the recognition.

1656:	Earlier, Scripps Health was named as one of the top 15 health systems in the
nation by Truven Health Analytics for the fourth time.

1657:	More than 76,000 patients receive their cardiovascular care
from Scripps, making it San Diego County's largest heart care provider.

1658:	In addition, Scripps is the
official medical provider for the San Diego Padres.

1659:	Gynecology

Scripps offers a full range of gynecological services - from annual check-ups
and prenatal care, to deliveries, minimally invasive surgery and post-menopausal
care.

1660:	Pulmonary medicine

Scripps' pulmonary medicine services include diagnosis and treatment options for
routine and complex respiratory problems, such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and lung cancer.

1661:	These physicians are skilled at providing care to
older patients for a wide range of conditions associated with aging.

1662:	'High Performing' in specialty areas

U.S. News also recognizes "High Performing" hospitals that were not ranked in
the top 50 but scored among the top 10 percent of hospitals that received
scores.

1663:	State and metro rankings

U.S. News also ranked best regional hospitals in 45 metropolitan areas with a
population of a million people or more, based largely on the number of national
rankings achieved.

1664:	Methodology

U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition or added risk because of other health problems or age.

1665:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, the adequacy of nurse
staffing levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most
specialties.

1666:	All
rankings have been published at http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals and will
appear in print in the U.S. News Best Hospitals guidebook, available in
bookstores and on newsstands in September.

HIGHLIGHT: Consumer Reports based rankings on post-surgery Medicare billing data
of elderly patients.

1669:	But this week a Consumer Reports guide put Tampa General at the bottom of the
list in Florida when it comes to how elderly patients do after surgeries.

1670:	The local rankings fit into a surprising overall theme of the new Consumer
Reports guide: Many of the nation's best-regarded hospitals didn't do as well as
their smaller, lesser-known counterparts.

1671:	Researchers analyzed Medicare claims data from 2009 to 2011 for more than two
dozen procedures, including back surgery, vascular surgery, and hip and knee
replacements.

1672:	Consumer Reports then evaluated the hospitals based on whether
patients died in the hospital or stayed longer than expected after their
surgeries.

1673:	On
the whole, teaching hospitals such as TGH did not do better than average in the
rankings.

1674:	For instance, medical codes indicate whether a surgical patient is admitted with
hypertension, she said, so the model makes allowances.

1675:	BayCare Health System, Tampa Bay's largest health care provider, includes both
the high-ranking St. Anthony's and low-ranking Morton Plant Hospital.

1676:	Spokeswoman Beth Hardy said patients shouldn't use only the Consumer Reports
guide when making a decision about where to get surgery.

1677:	For one, it looks only at older patients.

1678:	"It's unlikely these data are a good
idea of what non-Medicare patients should expect," she said.

1679:	Also, she noted,
hospitals often keep elderly patients in their care longer because they don't
have anyone to help them at home while recuperating.

1680:	She said researchers didn't have an explanation for why the smaller community
hospitals did better than the larger ones.

1681:	The ranking places Gundersen Lutheran among the nation's top 5 percent of
hospitals.

1682:	This year only 270 of the nation's nearly 5,000 non-federal hospitals
will receive the award.

1683:	The rankings are based on an independent study of mortality and complication
rates for nearly 5,000 hospitals released by HealthGrades, a national health
care ratings company.

1684:	According to the HealthGrades study, patients admitted to a hospital receiving
this award are, on average, 27 percent less likely to die and 8 percent less
likely to suffer from a major complication.

PALM COAST Florida Hospital Flagler is one of the prettiest hospitals in the
nation.

1687:	And, according to a healthcare business information company, it also is
one of the nations best.

1688:	The hospital was named one of the nations top 100
hospitals by Solucient in its latest National Benchmarks for Success study.

1689:	The
study ranks hospitals of similar size in four performance areas: quality of
care; efficiency; financial performance; and growing community service.

1690:	This is the first time weve made the Solucient Top 100, said Eric Stevens, vice
president for operations at the Flagler County facility.

1691:	Solucient is one of the largest and most prestigious benchmarking (companies)
looking at hospitals.

1692:	Under the category of small community hospitals, Florida
Hospital Flagler out- performed facilities of similar size on several measures.

1693:	The hospitals average length of stay was 3.63 days, 11 percent shorter than at
other benchmark hospitals.

1694:	The hospitals percentage of community served
increased over the study period compared to a slight drop for similar sized
facilities.

1695:	Stevens said the ranking is a validation of the hospitals effort to
provide quality care for the community.

1696:	It
compares very favorably with similar hospitals across the country.

1697:	Stevens said
the high ranking also gives the Flagler facility a glimpse at how it compares
with other hospitals.

1698:	Stevens said the hospital will have a plaque to hang in the front lobby and will
put up a banner announcing the ranking but, for the most part, any celebrating
will be done internally with employees.

1699:	Its
also been rated by Solucient as one of the nations top 100 hospitals.File

Hospitals to have rankings

BYLINE: Suchitra Bajpai Chaudhary Senior Reporter

LENGTH: 410 words


Dubai: The Dubai Health Authority (DHA) will soon introduce ranking for
hospitals and services, quite like the five star rankings in hotels, to create
international standards in medical tourism.

1700:	Announcing this at the Arab Health Congress, Dr Layla Al Marzouqi, Director of
DHA's Medical Tourism initiative and Acting Director of the Medical Regulation
department, told Gulf News: "We will rank health-care facilities and have
already started the initiative.

1701:	Among some of the criteria for rankings would be the performance, qualification
and experience of doctors, the rate of successful surgeries, rate of violations,
the capacity and quality of equipment, the ambience of the place, the
availability of translation services, the outcome of audits and other such
indicators.

1702:	Based on these the hospital's services or the hospital will be
ranked and the results will be available on the Medical Tourism website.

1703:	Eisa Al Maidour, DHA Director-General, added that the prices of all services
would be competitive and comparable to worldwide standards once the ranking is
in place.

1704:	Dr Layla also announced the introduction of the medical tourism club which
currently comprises 30 members -- CEOs and managing partners of private
health-care facilities who are major stakeholders in the medical tourism
initiative.

1705:	"The members will meet every month and will discuss various aspects
such as insurance, transparency and pricing, medical complaints procedure, etc."

1706:	She added that there is huge potential in the medical sector in Dubai and that
there are 10 hospitals in Dubai that are presently under construction, which
will add to the number of hospital beds in Dubai.

1707:	"Some of the hospitals are
specialised hospitals, which means the doctors will be specialised or even
super-specialised.

1708:	The growth in the medical sector is phenomenal.

1709:	Over the
years, health-care groups that had clinics are moving towards building
hospitals, while those that have hospitals and now moving towards building
super-speciality hospitals.

1710:	Some of the under-construction hospitals are
specialised hospitals for cancer, paediatrics etc.

1711:	All this will further
strengthen the quality of health care provided in Dubai which, in turn, will
positively impact the medical tourism initiative."

 Sacramento: California Healthline, The State of California has issued the
following news release:



   Though they can be a good place for a patient to start -- and can help
hospitals market themselves -- star ratings and other rankings don't take into
account how complex such health systems are, experts warn.

1713:	On Tuesday, U.S. News & World Report released its 27th annual "Best Hospital"
rankings, including an honor roll of 20 hospitals from around the country --
such as the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and UCLA Medical Center.

1714:	... Less than
a week ago, the federal government released its first-ever ratings system for
overall hospital quality, which in many cases seemed at odds with the U.S. News

medical care than communicating with patients, a skill they may not have learned
in nursing school.

Hospital safety group ranks Maine first in the nation

BYLINE: Jackie Farwell BDN Staff

LENGTH: 890 words


A national hospital watchdog group has again ranked Maine's hospitals the safest
in the country.

1728:	Eighty percent, or 16 out of 20, Maine hospitals earned an "A" in the Hospital
Safety Score ratings released Wednesday by the Leapfrog Group, a national
patient safety organization.

1729:	The letter grades reflect the risk that a patient could be harmed by a
preventable medical error while hospitalized.

1730:	Leapfrog, a nonprofit funded by
employers, assigns A, B, C, D and F grades to more than 2,500 U.S. hospitals.

1731:	Leapfrog urged patients to use the rankings to protect themselves from errors,
accidents, injuries and infections at hospitals.

1732:	That figure is four times the estimate of a widely cited but dated Institute of
Medicine study, which said up to 98,000 Americans die each year from preventable
medical errors.

1733:	"We are burying a population the size of Miami every year from medical errors
that can be prevented," Leah Binder, Leapfrog's president and CEO, said in a
press release announcing the new scores.

1734:	"A number of hospitals have improved by
one or even two grades, indicating hospitals are taking steps toward safer
practices, but these efforts aren't enough."

1735:	On average, hospitals nationally showed no improvement in their performance on
the 28 patient safety measures included in the score.

1736:	The exception was hospital
adoption of computerized physician order entry, in which health practitioners
electronically enter instructions for patients' treatment.

1737:	Leapfrog assesses public data on measures including falls, bed sores and how
consistently hospitals follow recommended treatment protocols, such as
administering antibiotics to patients within an hour before surgery.

1738:	Two new measures were added to the scores this fall: catheter-associated urinary
tract infections and surgical site infections after major colon procedures.

1739:	Leapfrog rates only general hospitals.

1740:	Specialty hospitals, such as cancer
centers, and critical access hospitals, which serve rural areas, are not
included.

1741:	In Maine, three hospitals saw their grades drop from this spring, while two
moved up in the rankings.

1742:	Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington improved from a B to an A, while York
Hospital moved up to an A from a C.


All the other Maine hospitals graded earned A's.

1743:	"We're most pleased with the consistency of the reviews of our hospitals' high
quality care," Jeff Austin, vice president of government affairs and
communications for the Maine Hospital Association, said in an email.

1744:	But even top-performing hospitals still have room to make patients safer, Binder
said.

1745:	"Getting an A is not an end point, it's a beginning point, and hospitals should
be looking at everything they can do to improve," she said during a press call
about the new scores.

1746:	Of the 2,539 hospitals issued a Hospital Safety Score, 813 earned an "A," 661
earned a "B," 893 earned a "C," 150 earned a "D" and 22 earned an "F."


Neighboring New Hampshire was among the states with the smallest percentage of A
hospitals, along with Arkansas, Nebraska and New Mexico.

1747:	Leapfrog's scores are part of a growing effort nationally to help consumers
become better-informed health care shoppers.

1748:	The federal government also is
looking more closely at patient safety data, making a push through Medicare and
Medicaid to pay health care providers based on the quality of care they offer.

1749:	Consumer Reports also rates the safety of hospitals, while
U.S. News and World Report singles out hospitals as national and regional
leaders for certain types of care and procedures.

1750:	Each outfit devises its own criteria and scoring formulas, so hospitals may
perform well on one while flopping on another.

1751:	For instance, Consumer Reports
tabulates the number of patients who are readmitted to the hospital shortly
after being discharged, while Leapfrog doesn't.

Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and Baptist Medical Center South, which
share a license, are the highest-ranked hospitals in 2014 in Jacksonville and
the fourth-highest ranked hospital in Florida in the 25th annual U.S. News &
World Report's Best Hospitals rankings.

1755:	U.S. News ranks the top hospitals in 16 specialties from cancer to urology.

1756:	Here are the rankings for other Jacksonville-area hospitals:

- Mayo Clinic Florida: second in Jacksonville, eighth in the state, 12
high-performing specialties.

1757:	- Wolfson Children's Hospital: one nationally ranked specialty, 48th among
children's hospitals for pediatric neurology and neuroscience.

1758:	Hospitals that had no nationally ranked or high-performing specialities were not
ranked, although information about patient satisfaction rates is included in
U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals.

1759:	A total of 144 of the approximately
5,000 U.S. hospitals evaluated were ranked in at least one specialty.

1760:	In a news release, U.S. News said that in evaluating hospitals, "the focus on
the most difficult patients has not changed."

Jan. 31--Under a tier system being promoted by the state Legislature, patients
on at least two health plans would have to pay more for care at Cape Cod
Hospital in Hyannis than if they went to hospitals in Fall River or Brighton.

1763:	Tiered-plan programs ask insured individuals to pick up a bigger share of the
cost at certain hospitals and doctors' offices in exchange for lower premiums.

1764:	Insurers say they base the ranking system on quality and cost, but local
hospital officials say insurers really consider only costs.

1765:	And those officials argue that the trend toward charging patients higher co-pays
or deductibles at different hospitals is unfair to Cape Cod residents.

1766:	"It's not fair to your membership on the Cape," Jack Lipomi, senior vice
president of managed care at Cape Cod Healthcare Inc., the parent company of
Cape Cod and Falmouth hospitals, said.

1767:	It's not as though patients can walk across the street to another hospital, he
said.

1768:	Cape Cod Hospital has higher costs because the local health care wage index is
high and because it must make up the cost of caring for a large population on
Medicare and Medicaid, he said.

1769:	The reimbursement for those government-funded
programs doesn't cover the cost of care, which is passed on to commercial
carriers, he added.

1770:	"The quality measures are nationally accepted measures," said Tara Murray,
spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.

1771:	There is a level of quality hospitals must meet, she said.

1772:	"Then we tier based
on cost."

1773:	For example, a Blue Options patient with no deductible who gets an MRI at Cape
Cod Hospital, which is in the "basic benefits tier," would pay $250, compared
with $150 at a "standard benefits" hospital such as Caritas Good Samaritan in
Brockton or $75 at an "enhanced benefits" hospital such as Caritas St. Elizabeth
Medical Center in Brighton.

1774:	Blue Options is marketed to employers who want to offer employees plans with
lower premiums, Murray said.

1775:	"We want to provide choices to the employer
community," she said.

1776:	But tiering creates a lot of confusion, said Karen Granoff, senior director of
managed care policy of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.

1777:	Rankings within a
single plan can change from year to year, and different insurers sometimes rank
the same hospitals differently, she said.

1778:	For instance, Cape Cod Hospital is listed in the lowest tiers for Blue Cross
Blue Shield Blue Options and for Harvard Pilgrim's Health Care Independence Plan
marketed to state employees and retirees.

1779:	But both Cape Cod and Falmouth hospitals' inpatient obstetric and adult
medical-surgical programs got top rankings from Tufts Health Plan's Navigator
plan, which means patients would pay the lowest co-pays out of three tiers.

1780:	The plans that also rank doctors heighten the confusion, Granoff said.

1781:	She referred to a case in which a patient paid a $25 co-pay to see a specialist
but had to pay $50 on a follow-up visit to see a lower-ranked partner in the
same practice.

1782:	In health care legislation aimed at individuals and small businesses that went
into effect this month, all health carriers doing business in Massachusetts are
required to offer at least one tiered or "selective" network with a premium rate
at least 12 percent lower than the comprehensive network product.

1783:	"It's one of our fastest-growing products," Murray said.

1784:	But the unpopularity of tiered products on geographically isolated Cape Cod
means that section of the law won't promise much relief to Barnstable County
employers.

1785:	And employers on the Cape -- who are seeing premium increases of 20 percent to
50 percent -- are desperate for relief, said Wendy Northcross, executive
director of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.

1786:	Blue Cross Blue Shield already was one of the higher-priced choices around, she
said.

1787:	"They're all trying to figure out ways to skin the cat."

1790:	Included as part of the 26th edition of the Best Hospitals list published by the
national magazine this past July, IU Health Goshen was ranked as the fifth-best
hospital in the state out of approximately 170 eligible hospitals.

1791:	U.S. News looked at a number of criteria in the ranking including hospital
reputation, patient survival, patient safety and care-related factors such as
the amount of nurse staffing and the breadth of patient services.

1792:	According to the rankings, IU Health received a "high performing" rating in the
area of hip and knee replacement procedures.

1793:	According to Ben Harder, chief of health analysis at U.S. News, the Best
Hospitals ranking utilizes consumer-friendly data and information with the
primary goal of helping patients with life-threatening or rare conditions
identify hospitals that excel in treating the most difficult cases.

1794:	"Patients deserve high-quality information on hospitals," Harder said in a
statement.

1795:	Seven Indiana hospitals received either national or regional ranking from the
magazine, including Elkhart General Hospital.

1796:	The award recognizes hospitals that consistently
demonstrate excellence in heart attack care by delivering timely, appropriate,
safe and defect free care.

1797:	"Several years ago, we said we wanted to make Goshen the safest place in the
country to have a heart attack," said Mark Smucker, medical director of
cardiology services at the hospital.

1798:	We are
pleased to see that the number of hospitals receiving this award is going up
each year.

1799:	To receive the award the hospital was required to consistently follow treatment
guidelines set forth in the American College of Cardiology's ACTION Registry for
eight consecutive quarters and meet a 90 percent performance standard for
specific performance measures.

1800:	Clinical guidelines assessed included:

--Quality of care provided to ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients

--Quality of care provided to non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients

--Patient safety

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a heart attack --
also called a myocardial infarction -- occurs when a blood clot in a coronary
artery partially or completely blocks blood flow to the heart muscle.

challenging patients.

1804:	"We are proud to remain among the top 15 hospitals in Washington, DC.

1805:	We strive for quality of
service each and every day, providing the best possible care to our patients,"
said Deborah Addo, CEO, Inova Mount Vernon Hospital.

1806:	Inova Mount Vernon Hospital also ranked among the top 20 hospitals in Virginia.

1807:	For 2014-15, U.S. News evaluated hospitals in 16 adult specialties and ranked
the top 50 in most of the specialties.

1808:	Just three percent of the nearly 5,000
hospitals that were analyzed for Best Hospitals 2014-15 earned national ranking
in even one specialty.

1809:	U.S. News also recognizes hospitals that perform nearly at the level of their
nationally ranked peers and represent valuable regional sources of quality care.

1810:	"A Best Hospital has demonstrated its expertise in treating the most
challenging patients."

1811:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition or extra risk because of age or multiple health problems.

1812:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, adequacy of nurse staffing
levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most specialties.

1813:	At 89,000 square feet, Halifax Health, which hospitals in both Daytona Beach and
Port Orange, has the largest emergency room in the state of Florida.

1814:	The national Best Hospitals rankings
recognize hospitals that excel in treating the most challenging patients, such
as those whose illnesses include underlying conditions, difficult procedures and
other medical issues.

1815:	Of the 902 hospitals evaluated for cancer care in the United
States, Moffitt's ranking places it in the top 1 percent.

1816:	1 hospital in Tampa metro area

Tampa General Hospital was recently ranked the top hospital in the Tampa metro
area and one of the top 50 hospitals nationally in six medical specialties by
U.S. News & World Report.

specialties: cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and endocrinology,
gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery, nephrology, pulmonology and
urology.

1818:	Tampa General also received high performing ratings in three medical
specialties: geriatrics, neurology and neurosurgery and orthopedics.

 Though they can be a good place for a patient to start -- and can help
hospitals market themselves -- star ratings and other rankings don't take into
account how complex such health systems are, experts warn.

1826:	On Tuesday, U.S. News  & World Report released its 27th annual "Best Hospital"
rankings, including an honor roll of 20 hospitals from around the country --
such as the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and UCLA Medical Center.

1827:	... Less than
a week ago, the federal government released its first-ever ratings system for
overall hospital quality, which in many cases seemed at odds with the U.S. News
rankings.

1828:	For example, the government placed Paradise Valley Hospital in
National City above the usually vaunted UC San Diego Medical Center.

 What if they get the wrong paperwork, medication, surgery -- the list goes on.

1830:	And the "what ifs" can lead friends and family members to overstep their bounds
with hospital staff.

1831:	Conversely, nurses may be more concerned with providing
medical care than communicating with patients, a skill they may not have learned
in nursing school.

1832:	Programs and workshops are cropping up to help nurses communicate with
patients and their loved ones, and hospital staff have some recommendations on
how to get the best care.

Jan. 28--Catholic Health System, which operates Kenmore Mercy Hospital and three
others in Western New York, was named the top integrated health network in the
state.

1834:	The list of the nation's most integrated health care networks -- the 2011 SDI
IHN 100 -- was published in a recent issue of Modern Healthcare magazine.

1835:	"A significant amount of effort has gone into this achievement...and we are
thrilled that we have moved up in the rankings and acknowledged as one of the
best health care systems in the nation," Kenmore Mercy Hospital President and
CEO Jim Millard said.

1836:	"This recognition is one more affirmation of the work all our associates and
physicians at Kenmore Mercy Hospital and all of Catholic Health do to redesign
our health care model and improve care, access and quality for our patients,"
Millard added.

1837:	"Our consistent improvement over the last four years is another indicator that
we continue to progress as a high performing health system," said Joseph
McDonald, Catholic Health's president and CEO.

1838:	"The bar moved even higher in
this year's rankings, as we compete among the best health systems nationally."

1839:	The ranking honors the most integrated health care networks in the nation.

1840:	The
networks are graded on operations, quality, range of services offered and
efficiency.

1841:	In all, 576 health care systems nationwide were evaluated.

1842:	Catholic Health officials said third-party rankings such as the SDI IHN 100 list
helps the organization measure itself against national benchmarks.

1843:	The survey is conducted by SDI Health, a health care data and consulting firm
based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa.

Kaleida Health, which operates DeGraff Memorial Hospital in North Tonawanda,
ranked 87th on the national list.

1846:	Only 14 hospitals and medical institutions out of 4,852 nationwide made the
Honor Roll.

1847:	The list is reserved for medical centers with high rankings in at least six
specialties, and Barnes Jewish ranked in the top 10 in 15 of them: orthopedics,
pulmonology, diabetes and endocrinology, kidney disorders, ear, nose and throat,
neurology & neurosurgery.

1848:	To be considered for the list, hospitals must meet at least one of the following
four criteria: be a teaching hospital, or be affiliated with a medical school;
have at least 200 beds; have 100 or more beds and the availability of four or
more types of technology considered important for a high-quality medical
facility such as a PET/CT scanner and certain precision radiation therapies.

1849:	Next, the hospitals had to meet a volume requirement, individually calculated
for each specialty.

1850:	This narrows the pool of eligible candidates to about 1,800 hospitals.

1851:	According to Avery Comarow, health rankings editor for U.S. News & World Report,
an independent research company in North Carolina, the Research Triangle
Institute, manages the survey, collects data and crunches the numbers.

1852:	Among other things, Comarow said, "they factor in death rates, reputation,
patient safety and a set of quality-related measures including volume, number of
nurses and the amount of technology that we consider important in that
specialty."

1853:	"We don't include patient satisfaction because there aren't any studies that
show that how happy patients are with a hospital has anything to do with quality
of care," Comarow said.

1854:	The guide is available online at usnews.com/besthospitals.

1855:	The August issue of
the magazine hits the newsstands July 27.

 Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the
following news release:



 The October 2016 issue of The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient
Safety, features the article "Consumer Rankings and Health Care: Toward
Validation and Transparency" by Bala Hota, MD, MPH, and co-authors, Rush
University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago.

methodological transparency in the following essay, "Hospital Rankings Have Room

 Hospital Rankings Have Room for Improvement



 Hospitals that care for sickest of sick found to be unfairly ranked



 When consumers make what can be life-or-death decisions about where to seek
health care, they often look to the numerous online hospital rating services
that are available, including the government-sponsored Hospital Compare,
Consumer Reports, and Leapfrog.

1861:	One reason is that patients vary in terms of how sick they are when they
arrive at the hospital or undergo surgery.

1862:	Older patients with multiple health
problems or advanced diseases are more likely to develop an infection or
complication than younger, healthier patients -- even though they receive the
same quality of care.

1863:	Something didn't add up



 Rush University Medical Center consistently has scored high on patient safety
measures, according to most rankings.

1864:	In fact, Rush University Medical Center
has received nine consecutive "A" grades for safety from the Leapfrog Group,
putting it among fewer than 100 hospitals in the country that have received the
highest possible grade each time since Leapfrog began issuing the semi-annual
ratings in 2012.

1865:	But last year U.S. News "Best Hospitals" issue gave Rush the publication's
lowest ranking for patient safety (one out of five).

1866:	For example, U.S. News data showed that 25 patients at Rush had developed
pressure ulcers, or bed sores, over a particular time period.

1867:	Suspecting a broader problem, they analyzed data on a sample of hospitals and
found that Rush was not the only organization inaccurately unfairly ranked.

1868:	High demand for hospitals' services skew safety scores down



 Two hospital characteristics tended to negatively skew U.S. News patient safety
scores: Taking care of large numbers of patients (i.e., high volumes) or
admitting a high percentage of patients transferred from other hospitals.

1869:	Webb, Hota and Lateef found that the U.S. News data set was missing key
information, such as whether patients with pressure ulcers had these sores when
they were admitted to Rush.

1870:	Large referral hospitals such as Rush, which provide highly specialized care
for the sickest patients and most complex conditions, also tend to have high
volumes and high transfer rates.

1871:	"U.S. News was very responsive to our findings, and the Rush community should
take pride in the fact that we take care of very sick patients very well," says
Lateef, Rush's chief medical officer.

1872:	"When you adjust for patient acuity
(severity of patients' conditions), our outcomes data are among the best in the
country."

1873:	Transparency Is a Two-Way Street



 Lateef and Hota, and the quality team believe that right now the rules used by
hospital rating systems are too complex for most consumers to navigate.

1874:	That's
why they are urging U.S. News and other hospital rating systems to be more
transparent about how they rate hospital quality, so that individual hospitals
can validate the accuracy of their scores and work with the rating organization
to adjust the scores as appropriate.

1875:	In the meantime, Rush will continue to measure, track, and share patient safety
data rigorously, and use that date to drive improvements to make Rush's care
even safer.

 Hospital Rankings Have Room for Improvement



 Hospitals that care for sickest of sick found to be unfairly ranked



 When consumers make what can be life-or-death decisions about where to seek
health care, they often look to the numerous online hospital rating services
that are available, including the government-sponsored Hospital Compare,
Consumer Reports, and Leapfrog.

1901:	One reason is that patients vary in terms of how sick they are when they
arrive at the hospital or undergo surgery.

1902:	Older patients with multiple health
problems or advanced diseases are more likely to develop an infection or
complication than younger, healthier patients -- even though they receive the
same quality of care.

1903:	Something didn't add up



 Rush University Medical Center consistently has scored high on patient safety
measures, according to most rankings.

1904:	In fact, Rush University Medical Center
has received nine consecutive "A" grades for safety from the Leapfrog Group,
putting it among fewer than 100 hospitals in the country that have received the
highest possible grade each time since Leapfrog began issuing the semi-annual
ratings in 2012.

1905:	But last year U.S. News "Best Hospitals" issue gave Rush the publication's
lowest ranking for patient safety (one out of five).

1906:	For example, U.S. News data showed that 25 patients at Rush had developed
pressure ulcers, or bed sores, over a particular time period.

1907:	Suspecting a broader problem, they analyzed data on a sample of hospitals and
found that Rush was not the only organization inaccurately unfairly ranked.

1908:	High demand for hospitals' services skew safety scores down



 Two hospital characteristics tended to negatively skew U.S. News patient safety
scores: Taking care of large numbers of patients (i.e., high volumes) or
admitting a high percentage of patients transferred from other hospitals.

1909:	Webb, Hota and Lateef found that the U.S. News data set was missing key
information, such as whether patients with pressure ulcers had these sores when
they were admitted to Rush.

1910:	Large referral hospitals such as Rush, which provide highly specialized care
for the sickest patients and most complex conditions, also tend to have high
volumes and high transfer rates.

1911:	"U.S. News was very responsive to our findings, and the Rush community should
take pride in the fact that we take care of very sick patients very well," says
Lateef, Rush's chief medical officer.

1912:	"When you adjust for patient acuity
(severity of patients' conditions), our outcomes data are among the best in the
country."

1913:	Transparency Is a Two-Way Street



 Lateef and Hota, and the quality team believe that right now the rules used by
hospital rating systems are too complex for most consumers to navigate.

1914:	That's
why they are urging U.S. News and other hospital rating systems to be more
transparent about how they rate hospital quality, so that individual hospitals
can validate the accuracy of their scores and work with the rating organization
to adjust the scores as appropriate.

1915:	In the meantime, Rush will continue to measure, track, and share patient safety
data rigorously, and use that date to drive improvements to make Rush's care
even safer.

Study: Hospital rankings might mislead patients

choosing a hospital If not by publication or Internet ratings, how can patients
choose the best hospital?

1918:	"The first step is to make sure the hospital actually
has the services you need -- not all hospitals are created equal," said Russell
Knight, president and CEO of Mercy Medical Center-Dubuque.

1919:	"A second step -- in
noncritical situations -- is to consult with trusted caregivers, such as
physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists, etc.

1920:	Of course, most patients will want to choose a
hospital where their preferred physician is comfortable practicing.

1921:	Another step
is to verify insurance coverage.

1922:	Relatively few health plans in our area have restricted networks, but some do,
so it is worth a phone call to the hospital business office, the health plan or
the employer's human resources department to find out if any restrictions
apply."

1923:	Hospital rating services recently took issue with a published medical
report suggesting publicly marketed rankings often fail to identify all
hospitals of equal quality.

1924:	The study in the Archives of Surgery found little
difference in mortality rates for three cancer procedures performed at either
hospitals highly rated by private services or other high-volume hospitals.

1925:	The
study shows for three types of cancer surgery, "America's 50 Best Hospitals" as
ranked by Internet-based HealthGrades, are no better than the other hospitals
once the number of patients they treat is taken into account.

1926:	Based on U.S. News
& World Report rankings, the Top 50 hospitals trumped the rest on just one
surgery: removal of the colon or part of it.

1927:	"Our findings show that both
ratings fail to identify equally well-performing hospitals of similar volume,"
Dr. Nicholas Osborne, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and colleagues
write in the study.

1928:	"Because these ratings list only a selected number of best
hospitals," the researchers add, "these consumer aids may dissuade patients from
seeking care at a closer, high-volume, equal-quality hospital."

1929:	"While we're encouraged by the study authors' attempt to help
patients find accurate quality information, in this case the study may have the
opposite effect and might actually discourage patients from getting the
information they need to make critically important health care decisions," said
Dr. Rick May, vice president of HealthGrades' Accelerated Clinical Excellence.

1930:	Hospitals often tout their services by highlighting accreditation, rankings and
awards, but do patients know what these accolades mean?

1931:	Here is a look at all
three: Accreditation An accreditation is a certification of competency, often
bestowed after a comprehensive survey process.

1932:	An organization called the Joint
Commission has accredited hospitals for more than 60 years.

1933:	Approximately 4,168
hospitals hold accreditation through the program.

1934:	Rankings Hospitals are
ranked in various ways.

1935:	"Finley's patient-care quality performance metrics are
utilized by numerous government and private health-care rating resources that
publish public data to assist patients in selecting a quality hospital," said
David Brandon, the Dubuque hospital's president and CEO.

1936:	Consumer Reports,
HealthGrades, Thomson-Reuters and U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals are
among the organizations that routinely rate or rank hospitals.

1937:	Others are rating
services purchased by the hospitals.

1938:	"With regard to this last example, consumers can quickly and
easily construct side-by-side comparisons of hospital performance on many key
indicators of quality, safety and satisfaction," Knight said.

1939:	It wasn't that he wasn't proud Data Advantage ranked Parkway among the top 1
percent of hospitals in the nation.

1940:	It wasn't that 28th national ranking among 4,500 hospitals for quality,
efficiency, affordability and patient satisfaction didn't make him smile.

1941:	For now, McGill and Anderson said they want area residents to know they don't
have to travel outside Decatur for good health care.

1942:	About 400 people, including hospital employees, public officials and community
leaders, cheered when McGill announced Parkway's ranking.

1943:	"This places us at the top tier and it's all because of you," McGill said to
employees.

1944:	He said the hospital is looking at constructing a medical complex to house
between eight and 12 new physicians.

1945:	McGill said the complex will allow Parkway to expand services such as cardiac
rehabilitation, wound care and a sleep center.

1946:	The unit has four suites with the capacity to treat 10 patients.

1947:	Another significant change came in June with the addition of what Parkway calls
the fast track emergency room the hospital operates Saturday through Monday.

1948:	The goal is to make sure every patient who comes through the emergency room is
screened and receiving services within 30 minutes.

1949:	McGill said the process has allowed Parkway to streamline patients with minor
problems and keep patients with more serious injuries waiting less.

1952:	John Muir Medical Center,
Walnut Creek was ranked in the Top 50 in Orthopedics, Gastroenterology and
Gynecology, making the medical center one of the top-ranked facilities on the
West Coast in those specialties and the only non-academic medical center in

1953:	Fewer than 150 hospitals are
nationally ranked in at least one of 16 medical specialties.

1954:	John Muir Medical Center, Walnut Creek is
listed at #2 out of 45 hospitals in the San Francisco-Oakland area and #7 out of
nearly 400 acute care hospitals in California.

1961:	The hospital
rankings, said U.S. News Health Rankings Editor Avery Comarow, are like a
GPS-type aid to help steer patients to hospitals with strong skills in the
procedures and medical conditions that present the biggest challenges.

these hospitals are the kinds of medical centers that should be on your list
when you need the best care," said Comarow.

HSTAUFFER@LNPNEWS.COM

Lancaster County hospitals get three or four out of five stars on patient
experiences, according to a new ranking published Thursday by the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services.

2038:	Those overall rankings summarize patient reports on 11 measures, including how
well nurses and doctors communicated with them, how responsive hospital staff
was to their needs, how clean and quiet the hospital was and how well they were
prepared for post-hospital settings.

2039:	"Hospitals are leaders in sharing quality and safety information to help
patients make informed decisions about their health care," Akin Demehin,
American Hospital Association senior associate director of policy, said in a
written statement on the ratings.

2040:	"And they believe patients' perceptions of
their care are a critical component of that information."

2041:	However, Demehin said, although star ratings could be an effective way of
communicating that information, "There's a risk of oversimplifying the
complexity of quality care or misinterpreting what is important to a particular
patient, especially since patients seek care for many different reasons."

2042:	Just 251 of the nearly 3,500 hospitals assessed nationwide achieved the top
five-star ranking, according to analysis by Kaiser Health News.

2043:	Danielle Gilmore, spokeswoman for the sister for-profit hospitals Heart of
Lancaster and Lancaster Regional, said in an email that they value transparency
and consumer knowledge.

2044:	The Medicare comparison website "is just one of the many resources consumers can
use in consultation with their physician to make informed health decisions," she
said.

2045:	Together, the two hospitals had the highest scores in the county on eight of the
11 underlying patient satisfaction measures.

2046:	At Lancaster General, Dr. Lee M. Duke, chief physician executive, and Lisa R.
Hess, vice president of marketing, issued a joint statement saying the health
system works constantly to improve quality and patient satisfaction.

2047:	They also noted the results of two of the 11 component scores - that 78 percent
of Lancaster General patients would "definitely recommend" the hospital, and
that 74 percent rated it a nine or 10.

2048:	WellSpan spokesman Brett Marcy said the health system "has recently implemented
a broad survey process across our entire organization, including Ephrata, which
will help us gather valuable insights from our patients and their families."

2049:	"We've also engaged industry experts to teach our staff, at all levels, how they
can help to make our patients, families and visitors feel more comfortable when
they're with us," he said.

2050:	"And we've developed councils with patient advisers
to help us improve not just their experience, but also our daily operations."

2051:	The 158 Pennsylvania hospitals issued patient experience ratings averaged 3.2
stars, according to analysis by Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service.

2052:	The approximate percentage of Pennsylvania hospitals issued each rating is as
follows.

2053:	1 star: 1 percent

 2 stars: 14 percent

 3 stars: 54 percent

 4 stars: 27 percent

 5 stars: 5 percent

Four Allegheny Health Network Hospitals Named High Performers by U.S. News

LENGTH: 542  words


July 23 -- US based Allegheny Health Network issued the following news release:

Four hospitals affiliated with the Allegheny Health Network have been lauded in
the latest ranking of the country's best hospitals by U.S. News and World
Report.

2054:	Released online today and slated for publication in August, the U.S.
News 2014-2015 Best Hospital's Guide recognizes Allegheny General Hospital
(AGH), Forbes Hospital, Saint Vincent Hospital and West Penn Hospital as high
performing medical centers across multiple clinical specialties.

2055:	"There is no higher priority at Allegheny Health Network than the quality and
safety of the care that we provide to our patients, and we are extremely proud
of our physicians, nurses and support staff for the outstanding skill and
dedication they bring to the bedside and into our physician offices every day to
help us fulfill that promise," said Tony Farah, MD, Allegheny Health Network's
chief medical officer.

2056:	Just 752 of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals earn U.S. News' designation as
a high performing medical center in the 2014-15 report.

2057:	The Best Hospitals rankings are intended to help patients with life-threatening
or rare conditions identify hospitals that excel in treating the most difficult
cases.

2058:	The rankings are based on a combination of objective clinical information
gleaned from Medicare outcomes data and the annual American Hospital Association
Survey - including patient mortality rates, patient safety scores,
nurse-to-patient ratio, procedure volumes and technological capabilities - and a
hospital's reputation score in each category as determined by a random, national
survey of medical specialists across the country.

2059:	"U.S. News strives to provide patients and their families with the most
comprehensive data available on hospitals," said Avery Comarow, U.S. News health
rankings editor.

2060:	"With an estimated 400,000 deaths occurring in hospitals each
year from medical errors, measuring safety performance is critical to
understanding how well a hospital cares for its patients.

New Delhi, Sept. 14 -- Since its founding, The Johns Hopkins Hospital has broken
new ground, led the field in medicine and made history in countless ways.

2062:	Just
one of the hospital's many historic achievements is that it was consecutively
ranked #1 in the nation for 21 years out of the 23 in which U.S. News & World
Report has held its annual rankings of U.S. hospitals.

2063:	In the magazine's inaugural ranking of hospitals at the state level,
the hospital ranked #1 in Maryland.

2064:	It ranked #1 in the Baltimore metropolitan
region, and it is the only hospital in the state that has consistently ranked
nationally in 16 medical specialties.

2065:	"We continue to be ranked among the very best hospitals in the nation, and we
are proud of our outstanding faculty, nurses and staff who make it happen," says
Paul B. Rothman, M.D., dean and CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine.

2066:	"This year's
ranking gives us one more opportunity to express our thanks and gratitude to the
people of Johns Hopkins Medicine and to recognize their dedication to the
patients and communities we serve."

2067:	"We have witnessed the
completion of our hospital expansion with the opening of the Sheikh Zayed Tower
and The Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center, the largest hospital project
in the nation and one that provides a beautiful, patient-centered environment
for those who trust us with their health care.

2068:	We have also implemented a host
of other actions designed to ensure the continued strength and vitality of Johns
Hopkins Medicine as we position ourselves for the future while ensuring that our
patients remain at the center of everything we do.

2069:	"These investments continue to strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission to
provide the innovative and compassionate care that is the Johns Hopkins
hallmark, to advance science and knowledge through research, and to educate in
new and innovative ways the next generation of physicians and scientists,"
Rothman says.

2070:	"All of the medical centers on the magazine's national honor roll are superb,
and we are privileged to be in their good company," says Peterson.

2071:	"We
congratulate our colleagues at those hospitals who have been ranked with us
among the top hospitals in the nation and recognize our Johns Hopkins Medicine
family for their outstanding accomplishments."

2072:	USN&WR 2012 adult rankings recognized four other Johns Hopkins Medicine
hospitals as achieving high performance within their state or region, for
specific specialties:

* Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center was recognized as achieving high
performance in Diabetes & Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Geriatrics,

Blue Cross revises ranking system Patients of lower-rated doctors will pay more

BYLINE: JEREMY OLSON, Pioneer Press

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg.

2074:	1B

LENGTH: 500 words


A new health plan from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota will make
patients pay more out of pocket if they use hospitals or doctors that provide
lower-quality care at higher costs.

2075:	Blue Cross tried last year to create a "tiered" plan that ranked doctors and
hospitals, but doctors objected because they were judged on their hospital
affiliations and not on their own clinical results.

2076:	The revised plan, announced Monday, measures physician groups on their own
costs.

2077:	Depending on their specialties, they also are evaluated on five to 23
measures of medical quality.

2078:	The resistance among doctors to last year's
proposal was "understandable," said Dr. David Ploncher, Blue Cross' chief
medical officer, but he believes the new two-tier plan provides a fair and open
evaluation.

2079:	In the latest list, some doctors rank differently than their
affiliated hospitals.

2080:	Insurers are hoping tiered plans will lower skyrocketing health costs by
steering patients to top-tier doctors and hospitals, which provide high-quality
care at lower costs.

2081:	Blue Cross is only offering the new plan to employers with self-insured health
benefits, meaning their costs are independent from other Blue Cross users.

2082:	The
rankings do not affect people with Medicare plans or individual health
insurance.

2083:	Two national employers have signed up, Ploncher said.

2084:	Blue Cross projects that employers who select the new tiered plan for 2007 will
see their medical costs decline by 6 percent to 8 percent.

2085:	The savings will
result from patients choosing top-tier doctors or hospitals.

2086:	Hospitals objected last year to Blue Cross' tiering plan, which placed the Mayo
Clinic and the two metro Children's Hospitals in the lower tiers because of high
costs.

2087:	Blue Cross did not change hospital tiers this year, but it plans to
re-evaluate hospitals and clinics on an annual basis.

2088:	Blue Cross is ranking only hospitals and clinic groups in competitive markets.

2089:	An initial list shows that affiliated hospitals and clinics didn't always gain
the same rankings.

2090:	HealthEast's hospitals in St. Paul, Maplewood and Woodbury gained top-tier
rankings, but its physician groups placed in the lower tier.

2091:	Allina's hospitals
are in the lower tier, but its clinics are in the top tier.

2092:	There is no shortage of assessments and rankings of hospitals and the services
they provide.

2093:	As the Herald-Tribune reported, U.S. News found that Sarasota Memorial was among
the top 10 percent of hospitals in the nation for gastroenterology and
gastrointestinal surgery.

2094:	All told, Sarasota Memorial is one of only 48 hospitals in the nation to have a
"high performer" rating for all nine of the procedures and conditions that U.S.
News considers.

2095:	One privately owned hospital in our region was labeled high performing in two
areas; two private hospitals were high performers in one area each.

2096:	Comparisons based on huge amounts of self-reported data are tricky, and patient
outcomes and satisfaction are often based on individualized circumstances and
experiences.

2097:	What's more, the private hospitals in Manatee, Sarasota and
Charlotte counties can point to other rankings and surveys that praise their
care.

2098:	But for Sarasota Memorial to achieve these ratings is particularly impressive
because it also serves as a "safety net" hospital, with a mission to serve
patients in need regardless of their ability to pay.

2099:	Yes, the hospital benefits
from a relatively modest property-tax rate, levied by an elected board, but the
services it provides to indigent and low-income patients are both costly and
valuable.

2100:	The hospital is not flawless, of course, and there are political debates over
where and when SMH should expand its services.

2101:	It is attended by a diverse student body -
racially, socially and economically - presenting both advantages and challenges.

2102:	1 hospital in the Tampa-St. Petersburg metro area by the
magazine, was also listed as one of the top 50 hospitals nationally in four
specialities: cardiology and heart surgery; nephrology; orthopedics; and
urology.

2103:	Other Tampa Bay hospitals
in the top 20 statewide include Moffitt Cancer Center (No.6); St. Joseph's
Hospital (No.14) and St. Anthony's Hospital (No.19).

2104:	All Children's Hospital was named one of the top 50 pediatric hospitals in the
nation in three specialties: cancer, cardiology, and heart surgery and
orthopedics.

2105:	Pediatric hospitals are rated by specialty, not overall.

2106:	"The focus of our
academic and community physicians, nurses, and hospital support staff is to
continue to provide excellent care so our patients have the best possible
outcomes."

2107:	U.S. News evaluates hospitals in 16 adult specialties.

2108:	In most specialties, it
ranks the nation's top 50 hospitals and recognizes other high-performing
hospitals that provide care at nearly the level of their nationally ranked
peers.

2109:	"The data tell the story - a hospital that emerged from our analysis as one of
the best has much to be proud of," Avery Comarow, editor of the U.S. News health
rankings, said in a statement.

Hospitals report is to guide patients who need an especially high level of care

U.S. News Health Rankings editor and writer Avery Comarow.

2118:	"These (ranked
hospitals) are referral centers where other hospitals send their sickest
patients," he said.

2119:	Death rates, provider-patient ratios,
safety records, procedure volume and other data were examined, therefore pitting
medical centers against each other, based on their performance and reputation.

2120:	To be included in the annual evaluation, hospitals must meet a stringent list of
qualifications, including the availability of unusually skilled inpatient care.

2121:	fewer than 3 percent of the 4,785 hospitals analyzed for the latest
Best Hospitals rankings ?

2122:	In order to make the nation's "best of  the
best" list, hospitals had to rank at or near the top in six or more
specialties.

2123:	Only 17 hospitals across the country, none of which are  in Utah,
could claim that honor this year.

2124:	This is the first year that U.S. News has included the
"high-performing" category, which lists hospitals that weren't ranked in the top
50 in a given specialty, but were still among the top 25 percent in the nation.

2125:	Hundreds of local physicians were also listed in the company's list of top
doctors, representing dozens of specialties.

a peer-nomination process and are listed online with each corresponding
hospital.

TAMPA GENERAL RANKED BEST IN REGION

BYLINE: KATHLEEN MCGRORY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg.

2129:	Hospital officials said the
jump was partly because Moffitt took steps to earn a prestigious designation
from the American Nurses Association.

2130:	U.S. News has been ranking hospitals for nearly three decades.

2131:	This year, more

survival rates, infection rates, the number of times a given procedure is

surgery; diabetes and endocrinology; gastroenterology and gastrointestinal

Ephraim McDowell HIS Department Earns Ranking

BYLINE: The Harrodsburg Herald staff

LENGTH: 201  words


Ephraim McDowell Health's Information Services Department has earned a high
national ranking from a respected health care news organization.

2140:	Ephraim McDowell Health ranked ninth overall from 45 medium hospitals (101 to
350 licensed beds) across the nation that qualified for this honor.

2141:	Overall,
Ephraim McDowell's Information Services Department was one of 272 hospitals
nominated for the Where to Work: Best Hospital IT Departments.

2142:	The survey measured employee satisfaction across a
number of key workplace categories, including leadership, management and
workplace conditions.

2143:	Hospitals that earned ranking are those where employees
value a friendly, supportive workplace where they are empowered to do good work.

2144:	1 place to work in health care in the
country.

2145:	The recognition comes from Modern Healthcare magazine in its first list of the
100 best places to work in health care in the United States.

2146:	Summit Health, which owns Chambersburg and Waynesboro hospitals, accepted the
award on Wednesday at a banquet in Chicago.

2147:	Modern Healthcare's rankings covered the entire health care industry, including
for-profit and non-profit hospitals, nursing homes, insurance companies, vendors
and other health care firms.

2148:	The rankings were based on a narrative submitted by
the hospital and a random survey of 250 employees.

2149:	The Modern Healthcare's assessment of Waynesboro Hospital took into account
employee culture, working environment, employee education and development
opportunities, and competitive pay and benefits -- even including a roving
massage therapist to reduce employees' stress.

2150:	"You get into health care because
you care about people and want to help people.

2151:	Not only is it about our
patients, it's about each other."

2152:	Shur said the ranking was especially important because health care is a
challenging industry with a stressful working environment.

2153:	However, he said the
hospital's employee turnover rate is well below the industry average.

2154:	For the
hospital, the hope is that taking care of employees will result in better care
for patients.

2155:	Waynesboro Hospital employs more than 600 people.

2156:	In 2003, the hospital was named the third-best place to work in Pennsylvania by
the Central Penn Business Journal and earlier this year ranked among the highest
in the region in patient satisfaction in a U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services survey.

University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics is the top hospital in the state
for the second year in a row and among the nation's top 50 hospitals in nine
nationally ranked medical specialties, two more than last year, according to
U.S. News and World Report's latest rankings released Tuesday.

2225:	Last year, St. Mary's Hospital ranked 11th among Wisconsin hospitals and was
recognized in two high-performing specialties: geriatrics and
diabetes/endocrinology.

2226:	U.S. News and World Report recognized and ranked 14 Wisconsin hospitals for
quality.

2227:	The store's answering machine at 3729 E. Washington Ave. says the business has
"suspended its operations, as yet for an undetermined period of time."

2228:	Henning opened the East Washington location in 2002 and moved all inventory and
operations to that location in November 2012 after closing the Downtown store,
at 640 W. Washington Ave.

2229:	"He really likes the
doctors and nurses here.

2230:	Nurses, Alexander said, would step in
whenever they were needed and every effort was made to make Zack feel happy and
maintain as much health as he could during the trying time.

2231:	"They're like my medical
family."

2232:	And the efforts of numerous staff at Primary Children's haven't gone
without notice, as the hospital again ranked among the top children's facilities
in the country in the latest U.S. News & World Report report card, released
Tuesday.

2233:	"We're always working on being better," she
said, crediting a formative partnership with the University of Utah College of
Medicine, whose professors and fellows make up the majority of physicians
working at Primary Children's.

2234:	Welkie said the staff's focus on quality care,
innovation, research and providing the best for patients and their families
aligns with the organization's purpose.

2235:	"Part of being a high-quality
organization, a learning organization, is continually seeking ways to improve
care," she said.

2236:	The Salt Lake Intermountain Healthcare-owned hospital serves
children within a five-state area of more than 450,000 square miles.

2237:	"We want patients who are close to us to come here,"
she said.

2238:	It's much better than his original prognosis, which was
leaning toward employing an artificial heart ?

2239:	They're not out of the
woods just yet, but she has always trusted that staff at the hospital have her
son's best interest in mind.

2240:	The rankings, based on patient outcomes and other data as well as
physician surveys, highlight the top 50 U.S. hospitals in the following
specialties: cancer, cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and endocrinology,
gastroenterology and GI surgery, neonatology, nephrology, neurology and
neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

2241:	The reputation of the
hospitals makes up a quarter of the ranking score, a smaller percentage than has
been used in the past, which somewhat levels the playing ground.

2242:	But the more
competitive hospitals tend to be well-known and in bigger cities, Welkie said.

2243:	Survey questions also changed each year, precluding hospitals from anticipating
ranking outcomes.

2244:	She said Primary Children's offers a
variety of services not necessarily found in adult hospitals, including a number
of innovative therapies that inspire creativity and inclusion, as well as foster
overall improvement and health.

2245:	A complete listing of the nation's best children's hospitals can be
found online, at www.health.usnews.com.

2246:	The publication intends to release its
annual rankings on adult hospitals July 16.

2260:	1 in the state, followed by Intermountain Medical
Center, and no other Utah hospitals were recognized by the report.

2261:	"We have a great team of faculty who not only are they really good doctors, but
they are innovative people who are doing excellent research," Shelton said.

2262:	"Having this collaboration really communicates to our patients that we really
are excellent at what we do and we do it because want to help people," she said.

2263:	Such collaboration allows lung patients to get comprehensive care as quickly as
possible for their related health problems, Blagev said.

2264:	Gomez credited the program's ability to rapidly and precisely identify patients
for common illnesses such as pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, as well as much rarer illnesses such as pulmonary hypertension.

2265:	He also cited "some of the best outcome rates in the nation" and innovative
practices that include "advances in telehealth visits and remote patient
monitoring."

2266:	"(We've been) expanding our clinical research efforts so we can reach a wider

2267:	"We
have been able to serve an increasing proportion of the Intermountain West so we
see patients from (throughout the) region.

2268:	Despite the abundance of medical rankings, those submitted by U.S. News are

long-running they are.

2269:	Although the large majority of the ranking methodology focused on clinical
operations rather than research, Sweetenham said Huntsman Cancer Institute's
renowned research side is a rising tide that lifts all boats, as one of only 48
organizations designated as comprehensive cancer centers by the National Cancer
Institute.

2270:	Huntsman Cancer Institute CEO Mary Beckerle cited patients' happiness with their

2271:	"Our patient satisfaction surveys have frequently placed the cancer center in

2272:	"It is gratifying

through this rigorous assessment of our cancer care programs."

2273:	Along with objective numerical data across more than 2,600 metrics, 125,000

POMONA - Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center has long been the place to go to
have a baby or get cardiac care services.

2299:	This week, it was recognized as a top hospital in gynecology and nephrology
services by U.S. News & World Report, making the publication's 2011-'12 Best
Hospitals rankings for the Los Angeles metro area.

2300:	This is the first time the hospital has been included in the publication's
rankings.

2301:	"U.S. News has long been respected as a resource in guiding people to highly
ranked hospitals and medical centers that perform safe, high-quality and
leading-edge medical care.

2302:	To be ranked amongst these worthy hospitals, for the
first time, is an honor for Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center and a benefit
for our patients," hospital President and Chief Executive Officer Richard E.
Yochum said.

2303:	"We have raised the bar for the quality of care provided for patients in need of
nephrology services and for women in need of gynecological care.

2304:	We're honored
by these two distinctions and welcome patients from throughout the Los Angeles
basin and beyond in need of these services."

2305:	The rankings give consumers local options where they can access quality care
when they don't require special expertise or when they can't travel to national
institutions, according a joint statement from the publication and the hospital.

2306:	"These are hospitals we call `high performers.'

2307:	They are fully capable of giving
most patients first-rate care, even if they have serious conditions or need
demanding procedures," said Avery Comarow, U.S. News Health rankings editor.

2308:	"Almost every major metro area has at least one of these hospitals."

2309:	Of 140 hospitals in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, 47 made the list and
Pomona Valley hospital was tied for 33rd place.

2310:	Making the rankings is an honor and is even more so because the hospital is in
the company of many prestigious medical institutions, said Dr. Victor Pappoe, a
nephrologist and chairman of the hospital's dialysis and transplant committee.

2311:	The hospital's dialysis program, which serves in-patients, is something that
helped the hospital earn the recognition, Pappoe said.

2312:	"I doubt very much that we would have (the recognition) if we didn't have the
in-house services we have now," he said.

2313:	Patients experience less bleeding and pain and faster recoveries that allow
women to be active sooner, Dhaliwal said.

2314:	The recognition of U.S. News & World Report is an honor, Dhaliwal said, but the
hospital and its gynecology specialists have plans to bring in other services
such as a group specializing in gynecology and oncology.

New Delhi, June 5 -- Texas Children's Hospital has once again been named as a
national leader among pediatric hospitals in U.S.News & World Report's 2012-13
edition of Best Children's Hospitals.

2365:	Ranked 4th among all children's hospitals

2367:	"We are proud to have earned this recognition by U.S. News, again being ranked

2368:	In addition to ranking children's hospitals overall, U.S. News also ranks
pediatric hospitals across 10 major subspecialties.

2369:	This year, Texas Children's
was ranked in the top 10 for eight out of 10 categories; high rankings in a
minimum of three specialties also qualified Texas Children's for the 2012-13
Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll, a distinction awarded to only 12
children's centers nationwide.

2371:	It's a
reflection of the outstanding commitment by our physicians, clinicians,
researchers and all employees to the highest standard of care for our patients."

2372:	The rankings are a result of a methodology that weighed a combination of
reputation, outcome and care-related measures such as nursing care, advanced
technology and credentialing, among other factors.

2373:	The hospitals also were
judged based on a combination of opinions from pediatric specialists about the
hospitals they would recommend for the sickest children and data gathered in an
extensive survey of the hospitals themselves.

2374:	"Treating everything from the most common to the highly complex surgical needs
of children is an integral part of providing the highest quality of care and a
major criterion of these rankings," said Dr. Charles D. Fraser Jr.,
surgeon-in-chief of Texas Children's Hospital and professor of congenital heart
surgery at BCM.

2375:	The 2012-13 edition of Best Children's Hospitals is available online at

specialties: cancer; cardiology and heart surgery; diabetes and endocrinology;
ear, nose and throat; gastroenterology; geriatrics; gynecology; nephrology;
neurology and neurosurgery; orthopedics; pulmonology; and urology.

2377:	"It's always great to be recognized, but this ranking is especially gratifying
because it's based on real numbers," Bruce McClymonds, president and CEO of WVU
Hospitals, said in a news release.

2378:	"The rankings represent positive outcomes for
our patients and the extraordinary care provided here by our physicians, nurses
and other health professionals."

patients visited WVU Hospitals' Ruby Memorial last year, according to U.S. News.

2380:	The parent of Mon General Hospital said Monday it is dropping its challenge to a
$248 million expansion at WVU Hospitals after WVU Hospitals agreed to reduce the
planned number of beds in the patient tower from 139 to 114.

2381:	The report, which includes rankings of more than 720 of the nation's nearly
5,000 hospitals, will be published in the U.S. News Best Hospitals 2012-13
guidebook, which goes on sale in August.

2382:	This year's best-hospitals list is the

Three suburban hospitals -- Edward in Naperville, Central DuPage in Winfield,
and Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood -- were among those joining five
Chicago institutions on this year's U.S. News and World Report list of the
nation's top hospitals.

2401:	In Chicago, three teaching hospitals scored high rankings in several categories.

2402:	The rankings are based on reputation, mortality rate, staffing and services, and
are heavily weighted toward teaching hospitals, in the view of Dr. David Cooke,
vice president for quality and safety at Central DuPage.

2403:	By surveying doctors on where they would refer family members, some institutions
can ride on past reputation.

2404:	"What may cause us to stand apart," Cooke said, "is our surgeons have so much
experience, taking on cases other orthopedists would not do," such as elderly
patients with heart or lung conditions or second joint replacements.

2405:	Dr. David Wilber, director of cardiology, credited a commitment toward providing
new technology that makes procedures safer and simpler, such as a magnetically
guided heart catheter system.

2406:	At Edward Hospital, the gastrointestinal department has grown to perform about
10,000 procedures a year, including colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer and
endoscopies to diagnose disorders like esophageal reflux disease.

2407:	Kelly Leonard, nurse manager for Edward's endoscopy services, said an important
part of the department's success was getting more people screened before they
have a problem.

2408:	On the day the deal was announced, Hallmark Healthcare stock jumped $ 6.75 to $
20.

awarding maximum points to those organizations that not only offer electronic
access to patient health records, but also provide resources for ongoing disease
management support, including mobile, tablet and desktop tools.

2421:	Axial Exchange
also ranks hospitals according to an annual Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
(CMS) patient satisfaction survey called the Hospital Consumer Assessment of
Health Plans Survey (HCAHPS), a standardized instrument for measuring patients'
perspectives on hospital care and is also used to determine reimbursement levels
for Medicare patients.

2422:	Lastly, Axial Exchange analyzes the extent to which
hospitals and health systems engage their patients via social networking
channels.

2423:	Lower ranking hospitals in the California PEI
included notable healthcare institutions like Olive View-UCLA Medical Center,
which received a score of 18, and Riverside County Regional Medical Center which
received a score of 13.

2424:	"Through our Patient Engagement Indices, we are starting to see more and more
provider organizations make a commitment to, and investment in, patient
engagement initiatives, demonstrating that healthcare organizations are really
starting to see the value of engagement programs-whether that be via enhanced
social media engagement, mobile health applications or patient education," said
Joanne Rohde, CEO of Axial Exchange.

2425:	"Patient engagement is a real game changer
when it comes to successful health management, and when done right, will
ultimately lead to improve outcomes, better quality care, and reduced costs for
the entire healthcare ecosystem."

2426:	All California
hospitals were notified of their ranking, and provided with the published data
for consideration in their own initiatives toward Meaningful Use and heightened
reimbursement.

April 08--Hazleton General Hospital ranks first in the state in a new measure
that the federal government uses to assess value in health care.

2428:	Through the Affordable Health Care Act, the federal government will increase or
decrease a small percentage of Medicare payments to hospitals based on the
ratings.

2429:	For the past few years, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of
Pennsylvania used federal data and formulas to let hospitals know how they
compare under value-based purchasing.

2430:	"For Hazleton General Hospital, of 136 hospitals which we have data for, they
ranked No.

2431:	This year, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will allocate
$48 million among Pennsylvania hospitals based on the rankings.

2432:	James Edwards, chief executive officer at Hazleton General Hospital, said the
ranking means the hospital will receive an extra $300,000.

2433:	That's about one-quarter of 1 percent of the total revenues for the Greater
Hazleton Health Alliance, which operates the hospital.

2434:	Medicare, the federal health insurance plan for older Americans, paid $36.39
million to Hazleton General in 2011.

2435:	This year's rankings are based on patient satisfaction surveys and what
Ciccocioppo called process measures, such as percentage of patients given
instruction sheets before they are discharged or the share of patients who
receive antibiotics before surgery.

2436:	By 2015, rankings also
will factor in data about hospital-acquired infections and total cost per
Medicare patient from three days before admission until 30 days after admission.

2437:	Previously, Ciccocioppo said, hospitals were not responsible for care given
outside the premises.

2438:	"We have a staff, we have physicians that
are very engaged in doing the best for our patients."

2439:	By another rating, the financial health of Hazleton General improved.

2440:	The hospital alliance earned more than $14 million in each of the two most
recent for which tax forms are available based on gross revenues of $110 million
in 2011 and $107 million the year before.

2441:	For 2012, the alliance said revenues of $114.3 million again exceeded expenses,
but Edwards didn't yet know the amount of profit when interviewed last month.

2442:	He said the improved bond rating allowed the hospital to save money by
refinancing debt.

2443:	The hospital alliance's long-term debt decreased to $21.5 million from $34.7
million between 2010 and 2011, according to the 2011 audit done by the
independent firm ParenteBeard in Wilkes-Barre.

2444:	When refinancing, Edwards said the hospital also allocated money to renovate the
hospital entrance, upgrade equipment and install a system for keeping patients'
records electronically.

UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Nation's Top Five for Treatment of
Newborns and Children with Breathing Disorders

LENGTH: 654  words


New Delhi, June 5 -- Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital at University
Hospitals Case Medical Center once again is ranked as one of the nation's top
children's hospitals, according to U.S.News & World Report's annual rankings of
pediatric hospitals, and for the second year in a row is ranked in all ten
children's specialties.

2446:	For the fifth consecutive year, UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital ranked
among the top five children's hospitals for the care of newborns in its neonatal
intensive care unit.

2447:	"We are proud to once again be recognized as one of the nation's leading
children's hospitals," says Michael Konstan, MD, Chairman of the Department of
Pediatrics at UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital.

2448:	"Rainbow has a rich
legacy in pediatrics and has been ranked as a top children's hospital on this
elite list for 22 years, since the inception of the U.S.News rankings.

2449:	This
prestigious recognition demonstrates our abiding commitment to caring for the
children of Northeast Ohio and beyond."

2450:	UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital's rankings in all ten medical and
surgical children's specialties are:

* #12 in Cancer

* #41 in Cardiology & Heart Surgery

* #11 in Diabetes & Endocrinology

* #50 in Gastroenterology

* #5 in Neonatology

* #16 in Nephrology

* #25 in Neurology & Neurosurgery

* #10 in Orthopaedics

* #5 in Pulmonology

* #26 in Urology

In addition to the top ten rankings, UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital's
pediatric cancer ranking jumped from 22 to 12 this year.

2451:	It comes after the
announcement of the Angie Fowler Adolescent & Young Adult Cancer Institute, made
possible by a $17 million gift by Char and Chuck Fowler and family last July in
memory of their daughter, Angie, who passed away from melanoma at age 14.

2452:	"But there is no greater reward than curing children of cancer, and giving them
the ability to survive and live happy, healthy lives."

2453:	The
acknowledgement continues the recognition of UH Rainbow's work with the most
fragile newborns, from pioneering neonatology in the 1950s to opening the
Quentin & Elisabeth Alexander Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in 2009, the $26.2
million state-of-the-art NICU.

2454:	"Rainbow has a rich history of excellence in
neonatology and we are always looking toward the future, and how we can continue
to enhance the care we provide to our babies."

2455:	Hospital specialties were ranked using a three-part combination of reputation,
outcomes and care-related measures, such as nursing care, advanced technology,
infection control and safety measures.

2456:	A complete list of the children's
hospital rankings will be published online at www.usnews.com/childrenshospitals.

They are among the best medical minds, hands and hearts in New York and the
nation: Doctors, surgeons and hospital staffs who specialize in treating
children with the most daunting medical conditions.

2483:	From brain surgery to open-heart surgery and cancer care, millions of children's
lives have been saved and enhanced by the care they have received at 10 New York
area children's hospitals.

2484:	Morgan Stanley-Komansky Children's Hospital was ranked outstanding in nine of 10
medical specialties surveyed.

2485:	"Investing in children's care is very important to us," said New
York-Presbyterian CEO Dr. Steven Corwin.

2486:	"Our entire
medical team, including physicians, nurses and social workers, strives to care
for patients with expertise and compassion."

2487:	Ben Harder, managing editor and director of health care analysis for the survey,
said U.S. News continues to make refinements to its methodology, which can have
a positive or negative effect on a hospital's ranking.

2488:	In addition to looking at patient care and staffing and survival and
complication rates, surveyors added additional categories to measure a
hospital's performance this year.

2489:	For example, hospitals that did well at preventing infection, particularly in
the pediatric intensive care units, were given extra credit this year.

2490:	"Our rankings are designed to provide a guide or decision support for health
care consumers, especially families with very sick children," said Harder.

2491:	In the 2014-15 rankings, 89 hospitals were ranked among the top 50 in at least
one of the 10 specialities.

2492:	Ten hospitals with high scores in three or more
specialties were named to the national "Honor Roll" list.

It certainly sounds like good news: The Ottawa Hospital ranks seventh out of 600
hospitals in Canada in the latest version of a respected list of the country's
top research hospitals.

2496:	But as recently as the 2012 fiscal year, the hospital's two dynamic research
centres - the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and the Ottawa Heart Institute
Research Corporation - had pushed it to fourth-best in the nation.

2497:	According to Research Infosource, The Ottawa Hospital spent $123.7 million on
research in 2013-14.

2498:	But that was down by about $6 million from 2012-13 and by
$19 million from 2011-12.

2499:	Spending per researcher at the hospital's two institutes was $332,500, 13th-best
among the country's top-40 research hospitals and substantially less than the
hospital has spent in recent years.

2500:	In the 2012 fiscal year, for example, the
hospital spent $507,400 on research for every researcher on staff.

2501:	The Ottawa Hospital spent 9.1 per cent of its total income on research in 2014,
a number bested by 17 other hospitals on the top-40 list.

2502:	In July, for example, the hospital's scientists received $28 million in new
grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Mayo recognized for children's center

BYLINE: Brett Boese, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

2507:	U.S. News & World Report named Boston Children's Hospital as the best children's
hospital in the nation, thanks largely to being ranked in the top 5 percent in
all 10 specialties.

2508:	The 10th year of ranking children's hospitals is generally regarded as a
precursor to the more widely recognized list of best hospitals, which is
typically announced in late July or early August.

2509:	However, it was not
included in U.S. News & World Report's top 10 list of children's hospitals.

2510:	"We are honored to be recognized for the quality care provided to the children
and families at the Children's Center," says Dr. Randall Flick, medical director
of the Mayo Clinic Children's Center.

2511:	"This success is a reflection of our staff
members, who strive to put the needs of the patients first every day, as well as
the application of cutting-edge interventions, such as the use of proton beam
therapy for childhood cancer and stem cell treatment for children with heart
disease."

2512:	According to Dr. Flick, the U.S. News & World Report's Best Children's Hospital
ranking is an important measure, but not the only measure of Mayo Clinic's
performance.

Six San Gabriel Valley and Whittier-area hospitals have received top rankings in
this year's U.S. News & World Report's best hospitals survey.

2518:	The report, designed to help patients and their families find a top-performing
hospital in their health-insurance network, identified 622 of the top-performing
metro-area hospitals of nearly 5,000 nationwide.

2519:	In order to make the metro-area rankings, officials said a hospital had to score
in the top 25 percent among its peers in at least one of 16 medical specialties
such as cancer and kidney disorders to orthopedics and urology.

2520:	PIH's patient satisfaction rate was reported at 80 percent, compared to a
statewide average rate of 67 percent and 68 percent nationwide.

2521:	"The physicians and medical staff deserve the credit because they do all the
work," West said.

2522:	"At PIH, we are focused on unremitting innovation and
dedication to providing a superior health-care experience for our patients."

2523:	It also scored high in patient safety, study officials said, which shows
commitment to reducing accidents and medical mistakes.

2524:	"It was great news to hear that Huntington Memorial Hospital was rated among the
top 10 hospitals in the greater Los Angeles area," said President and CEO
Stephen A. Ralph.

2525:	"It's wonderful recognition for our medical staff, nurses and patient care
providers."

2526:	"And we feel very honored to be able to serve
the patients in this region in these high-specialty areas."

OPINION: The survey says: We're among the best

BYLINE: Dick Lucinski, Niagara Gazette, Niagara Falls, N.Y.

2538:	Those were the national rankings of the two hospitals in the Niagara Falls area
when it comes to bang for the buck.

2539:	It's a rating of hospitals across America that lists the best value for
the money in health care.

2540:	According to the private firm Data Advantage, LLC, Niagara Falls Memorial
Medical Center is rated first in the state and 12th in the nation when it comes
to providing high-quality, affordable health care.

2541:	The survey rated 1,500
hospitals in the country's 100 largest regions.

2542:	In fact, health
care facilities across the Niagara Falls-Buffalo region littered the Top 100,
bringing our area in as having the best value in health care of any region in
the nation.

2543:	The folks who work at and operate our hospitals are justifiably proud.

2544:	"It's really a tribute to the entire hospital team -- all 1,200 employees and
medical staff," said CEO Joseph Ruffolo of Niagara Falls Memorial Medical
Center.

2545:	The index ranked the hospitals on four main criteria: quality of care,
efficiency of care and affordability, patient experience and reputation as
measured by local public perception.

2546:	For both medical facilities to come out as
high as they did is, as Ruffolo put it, a tribute to all who dedicate themselves
to the care of the ill in our community.

2547:	Ruffolo says the ranking will be a big help in recruiting top-flight physicians
and other medical personnel to the region.

2548:	They say that
it all depends on what you measure; that the criteria used can skew the results.

2549:	Change them a little and it could knock our hospitals down to the middle of the
pack.

2550:	Even if the survey isn't perfect; even if it has some
flaws; 12th or 73rd out of 1,500 is so high on the list that even if the area
hospitals were to be knocked down a bit, it would still leave them among the top
values in health care in the nation.

2553:	Arnprior ranked in the top three based on the "hospital mortality index," which
looked at communities in terms of hospital deaths in nine areas, such as
pneumonia and acute stroke, with the figures adjusted for factors such as the
patients' age and sex.

2554:	The municipal rankings, one of hundreds of indicators in the report, are based

2555:	They indicate the success of patients' treatment at their local hospitals and at
the larger hospitals that handle more complex cases, said Mark Mullins,
co-author of the report and executive director of the Fraser Institute.

2556:	In all, the report card assessed 50 measures of patient safety and quality of
care for Ontario's 136 acute care hospitals and 138 municipalities using
methodology currently used in a dozen U.S. states and data collected by the
Canadian Institute for Health Information.

2557:	However, only 43 Ontario hospitals agreed to be identified by name on the report
card.

rank rural and community hospitals in the nation.

2560:	Northern was named one of iVantage Health Analytics' Top 100 Rural & Community
Hospitals in the United States, as defined by the iVantage's Hospital Strength
index.

2561:	"The index is the industry's most comprehensive rating of rural and critical
access hospitals," the local hospital said in a statement announcing the
recognition.

2562:	"The results recognize that the Top 100 Rural & Community Hospitals
play a key role in providing a safety net to communities across America --
measuring them across more than 70 different performance metrics, including
quality, outcomes, patient perspective, affordability, population risk and
efficiency."

2563:	"Rural healthcare encompasses more than 60 million Americans and the facilities
which comprise our Top 100 Rural & Community Hospitals play a vital role in
ensuring the long-term sustainability of the rural health safety net," said
Michael Topchik, senior vice president of iVantage Health Analytics.

2564:	"Becker's is the leading hospital magazine for hospital business news and
analysis for hospital and health system executives," the hospital statement
said.

2565:	"Becker's defines a 'community hospital' as one with fewer than 550 beds
that have minimal teaching programs."

2566:	A release from Becker's states, "The hospitals on this list are not far from
major metro areas, while others serve more rural communities.

2567:	Regardless of
their location, or their independence or affiliation with a major system, these
hospitals are a vital part of their respective communities.

2568:	The Becker's editorial team selected hospitals for inclusion based on rankings
and awards from organizations including iVantage Health Analytics, Truven Health
Analytics, Healthgrades, CareChex, the American Nurses Credentialing Center and

care provided at Northern Hospital but none more impressive than being awarded
one of the top 100 hospitals by Becker's Hospital review," said Ned Hill,
president and CEO at Northern Hospital.

2573:	"There were 3,300 hospitals across the
country that were compared side by side and Northern ranked in the top 100.

2574:	We
are also very proud to be the only hospital in the State of North Carolina to be
ranked in the top 100 hospitals by both Becker's Hospital review and iVantage.

2577:	A new ranking of the USA's top major hospitals, out this week, makes answering
that question a little easier.

2578:	"We thought there was a pressing need for hospitals to be held up to consumer
standards like any other institution," says Avery Comarow of U.S. News & World
Report, which has produced best-hospitals lists since 1990.

2579:	The 1993 listings, for 16 specialties, represent the top 3% of the nation's
1,488 major teaching and research hospitals.

2580:	This year, for the first time, rankings for 12 of the 16 specialties are based
not just on surveys of physicians, but on measurements of objective criteria by
the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.

2581:	These include
mortality figures, technology, discharge planning and ratio of doctors and
nurses to beds.

2582:	Listings, in the July 12 issue, name 111 hospitals in 29 states and Washington,
D.C.

2583:	In each of 12 specialties - AIDS, cancer, cardiology, endocrinology,
gastroenterology, geriatrics, gynecology, neurology, orthopedics,
otolaryngology, rheumatology and urology - more than 40 hospitals are ranked;

LENGTH: 427  words


New Delhi, Nov. 21 -- Two Baylor Health Care System hospitals and a HealthTexas
Provider Network group are Press Ganey 2013 Beacon of Excellence Award winners.

2673:	Baylor Jack and Jane Hamilton Heart and Vascular Hospital and The Heart Hospital
Baylor Plano are Beacon of Excellence Award winners for inpatient satisfaction.

2674:	The Heart Hospital Baylor Plano also received a Beacon Award for emergency
department satisfaction.

2675:	The Beacon of Excellence Award, formerly the Summit Award, is one of Press
Ganey's most prestigious awards, honoring health care organizations that sustain
an overall patient satisfaction rank above the 95th percentile for at least the
past three consecutive years.

2676:	This is the fourth year in a row that The Heart Hospital Baylor Plano has won
this top award for both inpatient and emergency department satisfaction, which
is 24 consecutive quarters-or six years-of ranking above the 95th percentile in
these areas.

2677:	Baylor Jack and Jane Hamilton Heart and Vascular Hospital has also won the
inpatient Beacon Award for four years in a row, which is 24 consecutive
quarters-or six years-of ranking above the 95th percentile for inpatient
satisfaction.

2678:	"This honor confirms the steadfast commitment these hospitals have to role model
excellence for patients and families on a daily basis," says Terri Nuss, vice
president, Office of Patient Centeredness.

2679:	"Beacon of Excellence Award
recipients set themselves apart from the competition by demonstrating their
dedication to improvement and sustaining excellence in both quality of care and
patient satisfaction.

2680:	Achieving a patient satisfaction ranking above the 95th
percentile for the required three-year period is difficult enough.

2681:	This
award honors health care organizations that have reached the 95th percentile for
patient satisfaction, employee engagement, or physician engagement surveys or
clinical quality performance and is awarded annually based on one year of data.

 Urbana: The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois has issued the
following news release:



   The University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System is ranked in the
top 10 hospitals in the Chicago metro area and in Illinois for 2016-17 by U.S.
News & World Report.

2683:	"To be ranked in the top 10 hospitals in Chicago and across the state means
that our patients, including a significant underserved population that has
traditionally carried a disproportionate burden of disease, is getting some of
the very best care available," said Dr. Robert Barish, vice chancellor for
health affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

2684:	"We're making continued
progress towards reducing health disparities that affect our local communities."

2685:	The leap forward in the rankings can be attributed to the success of numerous
programs focused on improving outcomes for both inpatients and outpatients, said
Jodi Joyce, associate vice chancellor for quality and patient safety at UI
Health.

2686:	"University of Illinois Hospital has initiated a number of efforts aimed at
substantially improving care processes and clinical outcomes," Joyce said.

2687:	"Led
by teams of physicians, nurses, and other clinical leaders and staff, these
initiatives have resulted in double-digit reductions in hospital-related
infections, blood clots after surgery, and patients injured from falls.

2688:	We are
excited that the change in our ranking is a direct reflection of improvements in
the care that our patients are receiving."

2689:	They focus on 25 specialties, procedures and conditions.

2690:	The ranking
is based on such measures as patient survival, the number of times each
procedure is performed, infection rates, and nurse staffing.

2691:	The University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System is a public
academic medical center committed to providing the highest quality care for all
patients and to reducing health disparities.

2692:	UI Health is a leader in patient
care, research and education, and serves as the primary teaching facility for
the UIC College of Medicine, the largest medical school in the U.S.

2693:	The system
includes seven health sciences colleges, a 495-bed hospital, the 101-bed
Children's Hospital University of Illinois, an outpatient care center and 13
federally qualified Mile Square Health Centers located throughout Chicago.

2694:	hospitals
compiled by the Fraser Institute.

2695:	The researchers have complained that regional health authorities refused to
identify any of the hospitals, but Abbott said that's because the institute
would not agree to a proper methodology and was not comparing apples to apples.

2696:	Abbott said a similar report card on hospitals in Ontario has also been
criticized for the way the material was compiled.

2697:	NDP health critic Adrian Dix said it's wrong for Abbott to try to dictate the
method used by the Fraser Institute.

2698:	hospitals.

2699:	While the report doesn't name the province's hospitals, it does rank the
municipalities they are in, putting Nelson at the top and Salmon Arm at the
bottom of the heath-care heap.

2700:	Nadeem Esmail, director of health system performance studies at the Fraser
Institute and co-author of the report, criticized the province's health
authorities for refusing to identify any of the 95 hospitals involved.

2701:	However, he noted that municipality ranking is different than hospital ranking,
because patients do move around.

2702:	She said the ranking, which classifies Palmerston North Hospital as a "secondary
hospital that also provides some lower-level tertiary services", was "somewhat
understated".

2703:	The classification ranks Palmerston North Hospital below Waikato and Dunedin's
public hospitals, which are classed as "lower-level tertiary", and on a similar
level to Wanganui, Masterton and Kaitaia's hospitals, which are also classed as
secondary hospitals.

2704:	Mrs Mains said the commitment the plan gave hospitals was encouraging, but the
strength of this commitment depended on MidCentral Health gaining long-term
contracts and funding from the Health Funding Authority.

2705:	This applied not only to Palmerston North Hospital, but also to Feilding's
Clevely Centre, Horowhenua Hospital and all of MidCentral Health's services.

2706:	Yesterday, Good Health Wanganui chief executive Sue de Gilio called for
three-to-five year funding contracts to give public hospitals more certainty.

2707:	Presently, hospitals must re-negotiate their funding with the authority every
year.

2708:	Rangitikei Mayor John Wilson said yesterday he was thrilled that Wanganui
Hospital's future had been secured, and Taihape and Marton would also get to
keep their health centres for at least the next three years.

2709:	The
concern was that Marton and Taihape (hospitals) would close," Mr Wilson said.

2710:	"It will give us a breathing space to concentrate on issues other than health
for a while."

2711:	Health Minister Bill English has said that hospitals and health centres named in
the plan will not close in the next three years.

Maine Medical Center gets national recognition for care;
Its being among the top 50 U.S. hospitals in two specialities shows quality is
close at hand.

LENGTH: 275 words


Maine Medical Center deserves credit for being listed among the nation's top 50
hospitals for orthopedics and heart care and cardiac surgery.

2719:	But even more noteworthy, that ranking is a sign to Mainers themselves that it
isn't always necessary to go out of state for top-level care.

2720:	The listings were printed in the July 23-30 issue of U.S. News & World Report, a
newsweekly that has carved out a niche for ratings, including its more
controversial rating of colleges and universities.

2721:	In 12 of the 16 categories it uses, hard data such as numbers of cases, death
rates, reputation and care-related factors such as nursing and advanced services
and other statistical categories provide the foundation for its conclusions.

2722:	Out of 5,462 hospitals considered for ranking, only 173 met the standards in one
or more specialities.

2723:	Primarily, it's a tribute to medical professionals at all levels who have worked
long and hard to make MMC the quality institution it is.

Company: St. John's among top 100 facilities in country  ;
 Recognized for stroke, orthopedic health care

LENGTH: 401 words


A company that assesses health-care quality ranks St. John's Hospital among the
top 100 hospitals nationwide in treating orthopedic problems and stroke.

2726:	The Springfield hospital made the top 100 based on comparison of cost and other
criteria in the treatment of these patients, according to the Web site,
www.100TopHospitals.com, which is run by the health-care quality assessment firm
HCIA-Sachs.

2727:	St. John's also ended up among the top medical centers that offer orthopedic
surgery residency training, where would-be orthopedic surgeons learn the ropes
of the specialty.

2728:	Only 15 hospitals that offer such training made the top-100 list nationwide and
only one hospital in Illinois other than St. John's, Evanston Northwestern
Hospital, earned the ranking.

2729:	They compared outcomes for patients who had one of four types of orthopedic
surgery: total knee replacement, total hip replacement, partial hip replacement
and open reduction of a hip fracture with a procedure called "internal fixation
of the femoral neck."

2730:	To make it into the survey, a hospital had to have at least 200 patient cases
and at least 30 cases in each of the different surgical procedures.

2731:	"This award is the capstone of a more-than-10-year quality improvement and cost
containment effort," Adair said in a written statement.

2732:	In the stroke rankings, HCIA-Sachs compared outcomes for patients treated for
ischemic strokes, the most common type, using basically the same criteria as in
the orthopedic rankings.

2733:	St. John's scored among the top 100 hospitals that have neurology specialty
training programs.

2734:	Neurologists - doctors who specialize in diseases of the brain and nervous
system - often treat patients who have had strokes, which happen when something
interferes with blood flow to the brain.

2735:	Only 17 hospitals nationwide achieved top-100 status in both orthopedics and
stroke treatment, according to HCIA-Sachs spokeswoman Kerry Lydon-Minton.

2736:	HCIA-Sachs evaluated hospitals based on both clinical and economic data,
Lydon-Minton said.

2737:	How much it cost to provide care was as influential in
placing a hospital in the top 100 as how good the care was, she said.

2738:	The rankings, which came out Thursday, named Johns Hopkins Hospital and
University of Maryland Medical Center has the top two hospitals in Maryland.

2739:	Out
of 70 hospitals in the state, U.S. News and World Report ranked the top 15.

2740:	AAMC earned the highest ratings possible in seven procedures: abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colon cancer surgery,
heart failure, hip replacement, knee replacement and lung cancer surgery,
according to the rankings.

2741:	U.S. News ranked the top hospitals in every state.

2742:	Both hospitals are a part of the
University of Maryland Medical System.

2743:	BWMC and AAMC are both waiting to hear if the Maryland Health Care Commission
will approve the hospitals' applications for an open heart surgery program.

2744:	The
hospitals submitted for their applications for the certificate of need in
February 2015, following a change to the state health plan for cardiac services.

2745:	Politicians and hospitals officials have been vocal about how long the process
has taken.

2746:	The commission has said it has to carefully analyze the applications
because of the potential for legal challenges from competitors if one or both of
the hospitals are approved to have the program.

U.S. News and World Report recognizes two local institutions as among best
hospitals

LENGTH: 423 words


July 16--U.S. News and World Report magazine has designated two local medical
institutions -- the University of Toledo Medical Center and ProMedica Toledo
Hospital -- among the best hospitals in Ohio.

2751:	The two tied for 22nd place in the magazine's 2013 rankings of the state's 230
hospitals.

2752:	Dr. Jeffrey Gold, chancellor and executive vice president for biosciences and
health affairs, and dean of the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the
University of Toledo, said the center is pleased with the rankings.

2753:	Dr. Gold said that safety, quality, and patient satisfaction contribute to a
positive experience for patients at UTMC.

2754:	In patient satisfaction rankings, 65 percent of ProMedica Toledo Hospital
patients said they would recommend the hospital to family and friends.

2755:	"When we set our targets, we don't try to compare ourselves against Ohio
hospitals.

2756:	So when we look at quality-metrics, satisfaction-metrics, we look
throughout the entire country at the best players and we set goals for ourselves
based on those benchmarks," he said.

2757:	Mr. Polizzi said having multiple hospitals in the area with top distinctions can
be helpful to the community as a whole.

2758:	"I
think that bodes well for the community that we have a couple of hospitals here
in the top ranking."

When it comes to world rankings in any sector, Pakistan has hardly ever had
anything positive to write home about.

2764:	It is no wonder then that the country's leaders run to foreign shores as
soon as they need medical treatment; they do not trust the quality of service
offered by hospitals run under their own watch.

2765:	According to this ranking, there
are only four public-sector hospitals among Pakistan's top 20 medical
establishments.

2766:	It is a sorry situation for the majority of our citizens, who do
not have the expensive option of going abroad for medical treatment and must
make do with the local hospital system.

2767:	With
such poor standing and rampant corruption in public-sector health, attracting
grants from foreign donors to improve the dilapidated conditions of our
hospitals is a tall order indeed.

2768:	At the same time provincial and federal
governments seem to think that our tax money is better spent elsewhere.

2769:	The
latest economic survey shows that the health sector received only 0.45 per cent
of GDP during the first nine months of the fiscal year, which is almost
unchanged from FY2014-15, when it stood at 0.42 per cent of GDP.

2770:	According to
the World Bank, Pakistan spends $37 (Rs3,873) per capita on health, which is
lower than the WHO-prescribed level of $44 per capita (Rs4,606) the minimum
spending package required for essential health services.

2771:	It is unjust that our
public office holders head abroad when they need treatment while millions of
impoverished citizens travel hours for subpar treatment at decrepit government
hospitals.

2772:	It is a pity that we have been unable to produce a single world class
health institution in Pakistan's public sector even after almost 70 years of
independence.

2773:	"We're pleased with the way PGRH and northern hospitals in general were ranked
using this particular methodology," said Dr. David Butcher, NH vice-president of
medicine.

2774:	So our first reaction is
we're very pleased with the way PGRH fared."

performance on 39 separate indicators of quality and patient safety compiled
into a hospital mortality Index.

2776:	The report card allows the public to look up a
specific condition or procedure and compare the outcomes in their hospital to
others in the province.

2777:	Butcher said Northern Health's second reaction is that although the set of
indicators used will provide another way of measuring the quality of care and
performance, it doesn't tell the whole story.

2778:	"The hospital mortality index, for instance, is based on a very narrow range of
only nine indicators and because it includes things like death following hip
surgery, it rules out a number of our facilities where that type of surgery is
not done," Butcher said.

2779:	), where all nine of the indicators can
be measured.

2780:	He said CIHI measures facilities against like-facilities across the country in
matters like population, demographics and complexity of care and places
facilities in groupings rather than simply numerically ranking them against
other facilities.

2781:	"To link Prince Rupert, Chetwynd and Vancouver General hospitals together in a
ranking system is not fair to any one of them," Butcher said.

2782:	He summed up the importance of the Fraser Institute report by saying "it's an
interesting way of viewing quality and allows us one way of examining it, but
more importantly we're looking within the report at specific indicators and
trends within the hospitals over time."

2783:	He noted that in some instance, those indicators "per 1,000" patients don't
always give the true picture in smaller facilities where patient numbers are
much lower than the larger hospitals.

Aug. 09--Owensboro Health Regional Hospital has been named among the seven best
hospitals in Kentucky out of 120 in the new rankings of regional hospitals
released from U.S. News and World Report.

2811:	This is the first time the hospital has made the list occupied mostly by large
hospitals in Louisville, Lexington and Covington with health groups stretching
across Kentucky and Ohio.

2812:	U.S. News and World Report ranks all qualified
hospitals in every state, but only awards recognition to hospitals meeting high
standards and for specific treatment areas with high performance.

2813:	"We
weren't focused on this for the ranking, we were focused on this for the
patients and our improvement."

2814:	U.S. News and World Report uses a wide array of factors to organize its rankings
including performance in 16 specialties, patient feedback ratings and health
outcomes across several treatments and conditions.

2815:	The ranking of seven hospitals isn't an arbitrary number used by U.S. News and
World Report.

2816:	Only hospitals meeting a benchmark of standards set by the
publication can be ranked in the state.

2817:	In Kansas, two hospitals out of 150 are
ranked while seven out of 50 are ranked in Connecticut.

2818:	Strahan said being one of the only small regional hospitals to make the list
would serve as reinforcement for some of the engagements the facility has tried
to achieve with its community.

2819:	"It's almost like comparing yourself to a Fortune 500 company, seeing our name
next big hospitals with more resources, academic centers and more centralized
patient populations," Strahan said.

2820:	Owensboro Health was also recognized for high performance in heart failure, knee
replacement and hip replacement procedures.

2821:	The highest scores for these
procedures came from reductions in patient stays, increase in outpatient
procedures, reduction in return stays and quality rehabilitation.

2822:	Strahan said the hospital had specifically focused on those initiatives as a
part of measurements given to hospitals after the Affordable Care Act was
enacted.

2823:	"The ACA has changed the landscape with how we've thought about delivering
health care," Strahan said.

2824:	"We've developed more lean processes, used new
robotic and laparoscopic technology to reduce stays and extended care after
hospital stays."

2825:	According to U.S. News and World report, Owensboro Health Regional Hospital
currently has 356 beds, accepted 68,718 patients through its emergency room,
admitted 16,914 patients and performed 3,888 inpatient and 14,104 outpatient
surgeries last year.

Sarasota Memorial is in top 50 in only two of U.S. News yearly specialty lists

DATELINE: SARASOTA


For the past three years, Sarasota Memorial Hospital has trumpeted the release
of a national magazine's rankings of top hospitals.

2828:	In 2006, Sarasota Memorial was heralded as being among the nation's top 50
hospitals in six different specialties, including high-profile programs like
heart surgery and orthopedics.

2829:	Sarasota Memorial ranked among the top 50 hospitals in two
specialties, cancer and geriatrics.

2830:	"We're delighted to be on the list at all, given that we're a community hospital
and not an academic medical center," President Gwen MacKenzie said.

2831:	Last year's performance led the magazine's health editor, a former National
Institutes of Health director, to single out Sarasota Memorial for showing how a
little hospital can match up with the nation's best.

2832:	The magazine uses data from 2003 through 2005 on all Medicare patients at U.S.
hospitals.

2833:	In past years it looked at the percentage of a hospital's patients who died
before they could be discharged.

2834:	By that standard, Sarasota Memorial consistently scored better than the average
among the top 50 hospitals.

2835:	That measure has become the health care industry standard, said Comarow, who has
edited all the "top hospital" projects.

2836:	"It recognizes that hospitals should bear some responsibility for the quality of
their health care even after patients go home," he said.

2837:	The new mortality rates affected hospitals more than any other change, Comarow
said.

2838:	But he declined to discuss details for individual hospitals.

2839:	"Whether Sarasota was affected by this change I cannot say, but many hospitals
were," he said.

2840:	Milne said the hospital does not have 30-day mortality data, but related
measures like seven-day and 30-day readmission rates are low.

2841:	It also uses a 2005 American
Hospital Association survey of members' technology, staffing and services.

2842:	The study also considers a hospital's reputation, measured by a survey asking
doctors to rank the top five U.S. hospitals for each specialty.

2843:	A small drop in survey responses
could have cost the hospital its status, MacKenzie said.

2844:	"The focus should be on what we're all doing for patients," MacKenzie said.

2845:	The annual Best Hospitals rankings, now in their 28th year, are part of U.S.
News' patient portal, designed to help patients make informed decisions about
where to receive care for life-threatening conditions or for common elective
procedures.

2846:	TMCA also rated as high
performing in four common adult procedures and conditions for the treatment of
patients who are 65 and older, which included Heart Bypass Surgery, Heart
Failure, Colon Cancer Surgery, and COPD.

2847:	"This ranking is a testament to the dedication of every employee and physician
at TMCA," said Dan Miller, President and CEO at The Medical Center of Aurora and
Spalding Rehabilitation Hospital.

2848:	For the 2017-18 rankings, U.S. News evaluated more than 4,500 medical centers
nationwide in 25 specialties, procedures and conditions.

2849:	In the 16 specialty
areas, 152 hospitals were ranked in at least one specialty.

2850:	In rankings by state
and metro area, U.S. News recognized hospitals as high performing across
multiple areas of care.

2851:	"For nearly three decades, we've strived to make hospital quality more
transparent to healthcare consumers nationwide," said Ben Harder, managing
editor and chief of health analysis at U.S. News.

2852:	"By providing the most
comprehensive data available, we hope to give patients the information they need
to find the best care across a range of specialties."

As a group, more New York hospitals appear in more of U.S. News & World Report's
upcoming "America's Best Hospitals" specialty lists than institutions in any
other city nationwide.

2854:	Ten New York City hospitals are featured in this year's rankings to be published
in the July 23 edition.

2855:	Among them, New York-Presbyterian Hospital is sixth on the magazine's "Honor
Roll" of the country's 18 best hospitals overall.

2856:	For its 2007 rankings, the magazine screened
5,642 hospitals and medical centers, and graded 173 institutions in 16
specialties that include cancer, geriatrics, heart and heart surgery, and
ophthalmology.

2857:	The editor of U.S. News's "America's Best Hospitals" for 2007, Avery Comarow,
attributed the presence of 10 New York institutions on the list to the
prevalence of excellent universities and medical schools in the area.

2858:	"There is
a culture at these hospitals that amounts to a mission statement: 'We won't
tolerate low standards and we'll put patients first,'" he said.

2859:	Overall, Mr. Comarow said there is increasing competition among hospitals to
improve patient care.

2860:	"We keep raising the bar, and the hospitals that make the
ranking tend to be those hospitals that set that standard," he said.

2861:	Some of it is driven by technology, some of it is
driven by the bottom line, some of it is driven by marketing, and that's okay if
the results are good for patients."

2862:	He cited the recruitment of top
doctors, investments in technology, and efforts to improve comprehensive care
and patient satisfaction as driving forces behind the hospital's appearance on
the magazine's Honor Roll.

2863:	Last month, in data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,
New York-Presbyterian was the only hospital in the New York City area to rank
"better than the national average" for mortality rates among heart attack
patients.

2864:	"At the end of the day, I want you to be healthy and never need us," Dr. Pardes
said.

2865:	"But if you do," he said, using a music metaphor to refer to his medical
staff, "I want you to have an orchestra in which every one of the instruments
plays well."

Company: St. John's among top 100 facilities in country ;
 Recognized for stroke, orthopedic health care

BYLINE: TONY CAPPASSO STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL, Pg.

LENGTH: 476 words


A company that assesses health-care quality ranks St. John's Hospital among the
top 100 hospitals nationwide in treating orthopedic problems and stroke.

2868:	The Springfield hospital made the top 100 based on comparison of cost and other
criteria in the treatment of these patients, according to the Web site,
www.100TopHospitals.com, which is run by the health-care quality assessment firm
HCIA-Sachs.

2869:	St. John's also ended up among the top medical centers that offer orthopedic
surgery residency training, where would-be orthopedic surgeons learn the ropes
of the specialty.

2870:	Only 15 hospitals that offer such training made the top-100 list nationwide and
only one hospital in Illinois other than St. John's, Evanston Northwestern
Hospital, earned the ranking.

2871:	To produce the orthopedic rankings, HCIA-Sachs experts compared care at 1,200
hospitals across the United States by looking at the medical records of more
than 700,000 Medicare patients.

2872:	They compared outcomes for patients who had one of four types of orthopedic
surgery: total knee replacement, total hip replacement, partial hip replacement
and open reduction of a hip fracture with a procedure called "internal fixation
of the femoral neck."

2873:	HCIA-Sachs ranked hospitals based on how much the procedures cost, how long
patients were hospitalized, mortality and complications and the percentage of
patients that doctors discharged home, according to a press release.

2874:	To make it into the survey, a hospital had to have at least 200 patient cases
and at least 30 cases in each of the different surgical procedures.

2875:	"This award is the capstone of a more-than-10-year quality improvement and cost
containment effort," Adair said in a written statement.

2876:	In the stroke rankings, HCIA- Sachs compared outcomes for patients treated for
ischemic strokes, the most common type, using basically the same criteria as in
the orthopedic rankings.

2877:	St. John's scored among the top 100 hospitals that have neurology specialty
training programs.

2878:	Neurologists - doctors who specialize in diseases of the brain and nervous
system - often treat patients who have had strokes, which happen when something
interferes with blood flow to the brain.

2879:	Only 17 hospitals nationwide achieved top-100 status in both orthopedics and
stroke treatment, according to HCIA-Sachs spokeswoman Kerry Lydon-Minton.

2880:	HCIA- Sachs evaluated hospitals based on both clinical and economic data, Lydon-
Minton said.

2881:	How much it cost to provide care was as influential in placing a
hospital in the top 100 as how good the care was, she said.

2882:	Each year, U.S. News & World Report, using an extensive
survey and input from pediatric specialists from around the country, ranks
nearly 200 of the nation's children's hospitals and identifies only the top 50
in each of 10 specialty areas.

2883:	In fact, the Mayo Clinic Children's Center is the only children's
hospital not only in Minnesota but also the surrounding states of Wisconsin,
Iowa and the Dakotas to rank in each of the specialties included in the survey:
cancer, cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and endocrinology,
gastroenterology, neonatology, nephrology, neurology and neurosurgery,
orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

2884:	"At the Mayo Clinic Children's Center, we take great pride in our ability to
quickly and efficiently provide high-quality integrated care to children with
routine or very challenging conditions, whether they come from around the state,
the region or the world," says hospital director, Randall Flick, M.D., M.P.H.

2885:	The Mayo Clinic Children's Center provides comprehensive, coordinated care to
children with many types of health concerns, including the innovative treatments
for congenital heart disease, fetal surgery, robotic surgery and comprehensive
transplant services, many of which are available nowhere else in the state or
region.

2886:	The Mayo Clinic Children's Center was also the first children's hospital
in the state to offer Level One trauma care.

2887:	"Our ranking among the top children's hospitals in all 10 specialties speaks to
our unique capacity to assemble teams of specialists of all types at the bedside
of any child from before they are born, throughout childhood, adolescence and
seamlessly transition into adult care," says Dr. Flick.

2888:	Mayo Clinic and its children's center is the medical center most recognized as a
top choice for patients and families by U.S. News & World Report and many other
ranking organizations.

2889:	For the first time, hospitals will be ranked on the NHS Choices website for the
quality of their food, the choice available and the cost per day of providing
meals.

2890:	Maria Moore, deputy chief executive and director of finance for Great Western
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "Food and drink in hospital is an
essential part of the health, wellbeing and recovery of our patients, and at
both Great Western Hospital and in our Wiltshire community hospitals we work
hard to provide healthy, nutritious and appetising options for patients.

2891:	"These new food rankings for hospitals provide an open and transparent picture
of hospital food for patients, families and members of the public.

2892:	"Recent PLACE results have identified improvement has been made in the quality
of food provided to patients at GWH, which is pleasing.

2893:	"We have a Nutritional Working Group, made up of staff from a variety of roles
including dietitians and senior nurses, which regularly monitors and tests the
food served to patients both at GWH and in our community hospitals."

2894:	The new ranking system will be brought in as part of five new, legally-binding
standards, which hospitals will have to comply with.

2895:	They include screening patients for malnutrition, which the GWH already carries
out, and a food plan for each patient.

2896:	Hospitals will also have to take steps to ensure patients get the help they need
to eat and drink, canteens will have to promote healthy diets for staff and
visitors and food must be sourced sustainably.

2897:	The rankings, which were based on survival rates, adequacy of nursing staff and
procedure volume, analyzed the performance of hundreds of hospitals nationwide
in 10 specialties.

2898:	Of the 89 hospitals ranked in the specialties, just 10 were
chosen for the honor roll.

2899:	The rankings are aimed to best guide families of children with life threatening
or rare conditions to the best medical care available, the publisher said.

New York-Presbyterian's children's hospital has been rated tops in the city for

CPSI Highest Rated EHR Vendor for Fifth Consecutive Year; Eligible Providers
Successfully Attest for Meaningful Use Stage 2

LENGTH: 318  words


March 19 -- CPSI (NASDAQ: CPSI), a leading provider of electronic health record
(EHR) systems and services, today announced that it has been recognized as the
top ranked inpatient EHR vendor for hospitals under 100 beds by Black Book
Rankings.

2935:	This is the fifth consecutive year CPSI has been recognized as the top
overall EHR vendor for small and rural hospitals under 100 beds and critical
access hospitals.

2936:	"Our place at the top of
these independent rankings for five years in a row is confirmation from our
clients that our system and support have continued to fully meet their needs
during this transitional period in healthcare IT.

2937:	The top of the Black Book
rankings in conjunction with our industry leading 2014 Stage 2 Meaningful Use
(MU) attestations clearly supports CPSI's position as the leading EHR vendor for
rural and community hospitals."

2938:	Douglas
commented, "Many of our rural and community hospital clients own or manage their
physician practices.

2939:	Therefore, having a single vendor integrated solution to
address both care settings offers them significant advantages in the delivery of
patient care as well as operational efficiencies.

2940:	With the successful
attestation to MU Stage 2 by physicians using our ambulatory EHR product, our
customers can be confident they will receive not only the inherent benefits of a
single vendor solution but the financial ones as well."

2941:	1 in the magazine's comparison of
Maryland hospitals.

2942:	"The Johns Hopkins Hospital's record as a U.S. News & World Report Best Hospital
over the past 27 years is unparalleled," Dr. Paul B. Rothman, dean of the
medical faculty and CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine, and Ronald R. Peterson,
president of the Johns Hopkins Health System and executive vice president of
Johns Hopkins Medicine, wrote in a note to employees.

2943:	"It is thanks to our employees that Johns Hopkins' legacy of clinical excellence
and patient- and family-centered care continues to flourish," they wrote.

2944:	"We are honored to be among all the hospitals that made the list and, like us,
continue to improve care for the people in our local communities and around the
world," they said.

Sarasota Memorial Hospital was recognized Tuesday in the annual U.S. News "Best
Hospitals" report as the eighth-best acute health care facility in Florida, and
cited for high performance nationally in gastroenterology and gastrointestinal
surgery.

2947:	It was also listed as "top performing" in all nine common procedures and
conditions evaluated by the report: colon cancer surgery, lung cancer surgery,
COPD, heart failure, heart bypass surgery, aortic valve surgery, abdominal
aortic aneurysm repair, and knee and hip replacements.

2948:	That makes it one of only
48 hospitals out of 4,500 in the United States to achieve this overall high
quality, and one of four in the state.

2949:	No Florida facility made the publication's
"honor roll" of the top 20 hospitals, and only one of those - at Duke University
in North Carolina - was in the Southeast.

2950:	Other Southwest Florida hospitals did not make U.S. News' ranking of 35 top
hospitals in the state.

2951:	Of the many national hospital rating systems that analyze the same data - mostly
self-reported by hospitals to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -
the U.S. News report is considered one of the most reputable because of its lack
of ties to the health care industry.

Hospitals in Whittier, Pasadena score big on patient survey

BYLINE: By Daniel Tedford, Staff Writer

New rankings released by Consumer Reports reviewing patient satisfaction has two
San Gabriel Valley hospitals in the top 10 out of 145 southern California
hospitals.

2953:	At the same time, two area hospitals rank at the bottom of the list, according
to the rankings.

2954:	Compared to other hospitals in Ventura, San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Orange and Los Angeles Counties, Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in
Whittier ranked fourth with an 83 consumer rating -- first overall in Los
Angeles County.

2955:	The
patients sense that."

2956:	The facility has the only
trauma center at a community hospital in the San Gabriel Valley, so keeping
patient satisfaction isn't easy, volunter and customer services director
Priscilla Gamb said.

2957:	"It is a challenge (to maintain patient satisfaction)," she said.

2958:	The rankings are based on a quarterly federal survey of more than one million
hospital patients across the nation, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS.

2959:	The survey asks patients about recent hospital experiences regarding doctor and
nurse communication, cleanliness and noise in hospital rooms, and discharge
information and medication.

2960:	Since she came on, Snyder has tried to address trouble areas, specifically
communication between nurses and patients, Ternes said.

2961:	"If you improve the
communication with patients, problems get solved automatically."

2962:	Issues with information regarding medication and discharge was a problem for
most hospitals across the nation and in Los Angeles County, Consumer Reports
Senior Program Editor Nancy Metcalf said.

2963:	The federal survey takes into account some demographic information and whether
or not patients at one hospital are more sick over another, Metcalf said.

2964:	Consumer Reports didn't do any analysis on specific trends, but members of the
media have been telling Metcalf that hospitals in poorer neighborhoods have a
tendency to score lower on the survey, she said.

2965:	Also, specialty hospitals tend to score higher than others, Metcalf said.

2966:	Patients at those hospitals tend to have better insurance and are there for
elective surgery, versus being admitted for emergency services.

2967:	"Hospitals that don't have those
kinds of patients already start with an advantage."

2968:	Blue Distinction Centers are shown to deliver quality specialty care
based on objective, transparent measures for patient safety and health outcomes
and have a proven track-record for delivering better results - including fewer
complications and readmissions - than hospitals without this recognition.

2969:	*

Consumer Reports has released patient safety rankings provided by Becker's
Hospital Review for more than 2,500 hospitals.

2970:	The rankings are based on a
composite score between 1 and 100 of five quality measures using data from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.

2971:	The measures include mortality, admissions, overuse of imaging,
health care-associated infections and communication, according to a Medscape
report on the rankings.

2972:	UnityPoint Health-Finley Hospital was ranked as one of
the top 15 hospitals.

2973:	"For 2010-11 we analyzed 4,852 hospitals, virtually every one in the United
States, in 16 specialties from cancer and heart disease to respiratory disorders
and urology," the magazine reports.

2974:	Fourteen "Honor Roll"
hospitals had very high scores in six or more specialties.

2975:	Mayo was named among the top 10 hospitals in the country in 14 different
specialties.

2976:	The top five hospitals in 2010-2011 in the United States in order, according to
U.S. News & World Report:

2977:	Ronald Reagon UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles

The magazine says 83 percent of Rochester patients who sought care at Mayo said
they would recommend the clinic's hospitals (Saint Marys Hospital, Rochester
Methodist Hospital or Mayo Eugenio Litta Children's Hospital) to friends and
family.

2978:	U.S. News points out that even the best hospitals in the country make mistakes.

2979:	"No matter how skilled or deep their expertise, even "best hospitals" don't do
everything right," the magazine reports.

2980:	But when specialty care is needed,
these top hospitals are the ones people seek out.

2981:	U.S. News says 82 percent of OMC patients say they would definitely
recommend the hospital to friends and family.

The health-care ratings company HealthGrades has given The Finley Hospital top
marks.

2985:	HealthGrades, a health-care ratings company, ranked Finley Iowa's top
hospital for general surgery.

2986:	1 hospital in the state of Iowa is definitely an accomplishment,"
said Kim Fortner, a consultant for provider services for HealthGrades.

Measuring up

SECTION: Features; 17

LENGTH: 641 words


Targets can damage your health.

2992:	The Times reports today that the Government's
system of ranking hospitals is seriously flawed, with some top-ranked hospital
trusts having unnervingly high mortality rates and waiting times.

2993:	While
measuring the performance of such complex organisations is extremely difficult,
it is quite wrong for ministers to judge hospitals primarily against political
targets, rather than clinical outcomes.

2994:	If some second-rate hospitals are being
held up as models for others to follow, this is dangerously misleading as well
as grossly unfair, and will only set back the cause of NHS reform.

2995:	League tables for hospitals, like those for schools, are a sensible element of
the drive to raise standards.

2996:	But their very public nature, and the extra money
and freedom that a high ranking can bring, make it vitally important to measure
what matters as accurately as possible.

2997:	What is being measured when "three star"
status is given to the hospital trust in Walsall that has the highest mortality
rates in the country?

2998:	This cannot be accounted for simply by the fact that certain hospitals
are treating older, riskier patients.

2999:	Barts and University College London, which
have the lowest mortality rates in the country, are teaching hospitals treating
their fair share of high risk patients.

3000:	And the organisation that ranks
hospitals by mortality rates, the Dr Foster unit at Imperial College, London,
standardises as far as possible to take account of such factors.

3001:	Fewer than ten of the 30 criteria used in the
NHS Performance Rankings actually attempt to judge how a hospital affects
patient health.

3002:	In order to be considered for a "three-star" ranking, hospitals have
to perform well on nine targets, all of which are managerial, such as "improving
working lives" and hospital cleanliness.

3003:	It is only after meeting those that
clinical measures such as readmisssion are taken into account, and even these
look only at a small proportion of deaths - from heart bypass or non-elective
surgery.

3004:	The truth is that NHS services are already distorted to meet political targets.

3005:	Many of the hospitals with three
star rankings may have excellent clinical staff, but they are also very good at
managing to meet the targets, which is not the same thing.

3006:	Many of those
hospitals that score well on dealing with outpatients in less than 26 weeks (the
NHS rating) do much less well against the 13-week target used by Dr Foster.

3007:	But
if the Government moved the goal posts, the hospitals would change their
priorities.

3008:	Managers who prefer to be economical with the truth than to upset
Whitehall have good reason: the few who have dared to expose such practices are
regarded by government with deep suspicion and hostility.

3009:	But seemingly scientific indicators can be motivated
more by policy than precision.

treatment areas: cancer, gastroenterology and GI surgery, nephrology, neurology
and neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

3012:	The U.S. News Best Hospitals rankings, now in their 27th year, help guide
patients to hospitals that deliver outstanding care across 25 specialties,
procedures and conditions.

3013:	The Best Hospitals methodologies include objective
measures such as patient survival, the number of times a given procedure is
performed, infection rates, adequacy of nurse staffing and more.

3014:	For 2016-17, 153 hospitals were ranked in at least one specialty, while 1,628
received a high performing rating in one or more specialties, procedures or
conditions.

that were high-performing across multiple areas of care.

3016:	According to the magazine, 152 hospitals in the country made the list.

3017:	Slightly
under 5,000 hospitals -- which the magazine claims is "virtually every hospital
in the country" -- were evaluated using specific criteria that included areas
ranking in medical specialties, death rates, quality of care, technology,
nursing care and patient safety.

Medical University of South Carolina has issued the following news release:

MUSC was named by U.S. News & World Report as one of the country's best
hospitals in the treatment of ear, nose and throat disorders, nephrology, and
rheumatology.

3023:	We are a tertiary care center for the most complex
and severe rheumatic disease patients.

3024:	Our staff provides cutting edge
diagnostic and therapeutic services to patients of all ages - children and

including hospitals already identified as the best in the nation.

3027:	"Only about 15
percent of hospitals are recognized for their high performance as among their
region's best.

3028:	Just 3 percent of all hospitals earn a national ranking in any
specialty."

3029:	U.S. News publishes Best Hospitals to help guide patients who need a high level
of care because they face a particularly difficult surgery, a challenging
condition, or added risk because of other health problems or age.

3030:	Objective
measures such as patient survival and safety data, the adequacy of nurse
staffing levels and other data largely determined the rankings in most
specialties.

3034:	"All of these hospitals are the kinds of medical centers that should be on your
list when you need the best care," he said.

3035:	"They are where other hospitals send
the toughest cases."

Hospitals improve 'report card' scores

BYLINE: By Bob Groves

LENGTH: 763 words



Most New Jersey hospitals improved their treatment of heart attack and pneumonia
patients in 2004 compared with the previous year, health officials said Monday.

3046:	Overall, the 82 acute-care hospitals in New Jersey continued to score higher in
caring for heart attack patients than in pneumonia care, though the gap narrowed
last year, according to the state's second annual "report card" on hospital
performance in the two clinical areas.

3047:	"However, hospitals are still missing too many opportunities to give the kind of
care that can improve health and save lives," Jacobs said.

3048:	The New Jersey 2005 Hospital Performance Report scored the hospitals on their
use of eight procedures in treating more than 61,000 patients for whom such
procedures were deemed appropriate.

3049:	The five procedures for heart attacks were
giving aspirin to the patient on arrival and discharge from the hospital, giving
beta blockers on arrival and discharge, and giving an ACE inhibitor upon
discharge.

3050:	Pneumonia scores were based on three care measures: the percentage of eligible
patients whose oxygen levels were checked within 24 hours of arrival, the
percentage who received antibiotics within four hours of arrival and the
percentage who were screened for pneumonia vaccination and immunized, if
appropriate.

3051:	Although about half of the 22 hospitals in Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Hudson
counties slipped in their statewide rankings since last year, the majority
improved their overall scores in this year's report.

3052:	However, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
Services, which issued the report, cautioned that comparing overall scores is a
better indicator of improvement than hospital rankings, because there are
clusters of several hospitals that share the same scores.

3053:	Not all
hospitals treat patients with all eight care procedures, but were still ranked
with their competitors, he noted.

3054:	Also, patient volumes varied widely between hospitals.

3055:	"It's definitely a helpful tool to see where our challenges are, and where to
improve," said Faillace, a cardiologist and chairman of cardiovascular services
at the hospital.

March 04--Alabama's top private health care insurer has upgraded Regional
Medical Center on its preferred hospital list this year, preventing higher costs
for some patients.

3058:	Had the downgrade stuck, some Blue Cross
patients would have faced higher out-of-pocket costs had they been treated at
RMC, according to the insurer.

3059:	A Feb. 29 letter Blue Cross sent to some of its customers states the insurer had
adjusted its 2016 rankings of the most efficient, cost-effective hospitals in
its Hospital Tiered Network program.

3060:	The program, set to take effect April 1, measures and ranks Blue Cross'
in-network hospitals on quality, patient experience and cost.

3061:	"We will re-evaluate hospitals
throughout the year and allow facilities to move up if they meet criteria."

3062:	The letter states that any of Blue Cross' customers in the tier-ranking program
face higher out-of-pocket costs if they use a tier 2 hospital for health care
services as opposed to a tier 1 facility.

3063:	"Our mission is to provide state-of-the-art
healthcare to our community and we are pleased to be able to continue that
mission as a tier 1 Hospital."

3064:	Michael Korpiel, president and COO of St. Vincent's St. Clair, in a Thursday
email to The Star, said St. Vincent's continues to meet and exceed all tier 1
measurements for quality and patient satisfaction.

3065:	"The tier change is a decision BCBS made based on financial criteria that we are
still reviewing," Korpiel said.

3066:	"We understand the impact this decision will
have on our patients and continue to do everything we can to have St. Vincent's
St. Clair remain a tier 1 provider in the future."

3067:	Mackin said many of the ranking changes this year were based more on cost.

3068:	"Due to recent increases in healthcare costs, this year's criteria placed
greater emphasis on cost," she said.

3069:	"It is important that we continue to
provide our members information about the more cost-effective hospitals."

3070:	According to the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based national foundation that
promotes health care improvement, employers are increasingly using
tiered-network health plans to steer employees toward lower-priced,
higher-quality care providers.

3071:	In these plans, cost-sharing is lowest if members
choose providers from the preferred tier.

3072:	Over the
course of the study, between 2009 and 2012, 44 percent of hospitals changed
tiers, mostly from a lower ranking to a preferred one, and nearly all because
they decreased their prices.

3073:	Rosemary Blackmon, vice president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said that
in general, hospitals in the state aren't opposed to the tiered program.

3074:	"Having a focus on quality and value is something all payers are looking at and
it's not something hospitals are saying is a bad thing," Blackmon said.

A healthy, welcome dose of self-policing

BYLINE: By Times-Herald editorial staff

SECTION: OUR VIEW

LENGTH: 490 words


Nothing is more nerve wracking or fearsome as the loss of one's health, and
going to the hospital for treatment should not make those fears more frazzled.

3080:	Yet, based on their own records many California hospitals, including those
serving Vallejo residents, have yet to understand fully how their operations
before the scalpel, as well as during and after surgery, greatly heighten or
soothe patient anxiety.

3081:	That is why we applaud the recent launching of a statewide Web site that
compares hospitals in some of the most critical forms of treatment patients
face.

3082:	While the new Web site tends to oversimplify treatment rankings and is based on
relatively old data, it nevertheless serves as an important notice to hospitals
that they can no longer merely rely on perception to win patient confidence.

3083:	The hospitals already appear to be getting the message.

3084:	Kaiser officials say they provide excellent care for heart
patients, but until recently were admittedly inconsistent in how they recorded
that care on patient records.

3085:	Given their new procedures, their scores will rise
much higher, they insist.

3086:	A doctor who helped develop the ranking system said, however, that all
participating hospitals not only knew the methodology but accepted it.

3087:	We have no reason to doubt that the two hospitals as well as the 200-plus others
on the Web site will continue to work for improvements.

3088:	Any improvements will obviously bolster the hospitals' operations.

3089:	More
importantly, any reforms will work to provide not only better, more consistent
healthcare but also will ease concerns of most patients who have little or no
choice of hospitals they enter or doctors who treat them.

3090:	We commend the self-policing aims of the rankings, the participation of the
hospitals and hope there is a genuine growth of which areas are studied.

3091:	The
California Hospital Assessment and Reporting Taskforce should also be commended
for working with focus groups to determine an easy and understandable way for
those outside the medical profession to access this information.

3092:	Consumers will
benefit mostly, but improvements in the most critical of treatments should
trickle down to the most basic, and that's a very healthy development.

Springfield surgical hospital one of few in Ohio to receive top rating

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 734 words


July 29--A Springfield surgical hospital ranks among the top in the state for
patient care, while other regional hospitals also received high marks on new
federal scorecards.

3155:	Only nine hospitals statewide received the top score.

3156:	>>RELATED:Surgical hospital creates 250 jobs, medical hub in Springfield

Mercy Memorial Hospital in Urbana also fared well -- earning four stars -- while
Springfield Regional Medical Center earned three stars.

3157:	The goal of the federal ranking is to help patients make decisions on where to
get the best care, as well as to encourage hospitals to improve quality.

3158:	The
results are compiled quarterly, but this time new safety and quality measures
were included in the rankings, he said.

3159:	Fewer than 200 hospitals nationally received the top five-star rating, he said.

3160:	Officials from both Ohio Valley and Community Mercy Health Partners pointed to
steps they have taken in recent years to improve everything from patient
satisfaction to access to care.

3161:	At Ohio Valley for example, the surgical
hospital has focused on improving patient satisfaction at every step, from
making it easier to register through follow-up calls after the procedure is
complete.

3162:	"It's scary sometimes for people coming to health care and they're afraid or
don't know what to expect," Eistrager said.

3163:	At the same time, the data used in the star-rating system is at least a year
old, so it doesn't fully include the latest measures or results, cautioned Paul
Hiltz, president and CEO of Community Mercy.

3164:	"We're
interested really in trying to keep people out of the hospital and doing
preventive care in the primary care offices and partnering with public health to
work on having a healthier population here in Clark and Champaign County."

3165:	CMHP also appointed Dr. Donald Johnson, a longtime Springfield clinician, to
work with area physicians to look for ways to improve primary care.

3166:	That
program helps patients manage conditions like diabetes, congestive heart failure
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to improve care and reduce
re-admissions to the hospital.

3167:	>>MORE DETAILS:Mercy Chronic Care Clinic in Urbana already seeing growth

"Having the physicians engaged and driving this is one of the reasons you're
seeing improvements in our scores," Hiltz said.

3168:	The ratings system doesn't take into account the different missions of various
hospitals, he said, or the kinds of patients they serve.

3169:	The ratings can be a useful tool for patients, said John Palmer, a spokesman for
the Ohio Hospital Association.

3170:	"Ultimately it's collaborating and talking with their health-care provider that
is highly recommended for the consumer to make the best choice possible," Palmer
said.

3222:	The rankings compare the health in more than 3,000 counties and the District of
Columbia.

3223:	Other health factors such as smoking and obesity, clinical care and social,
economic and physical environments were researched.

3224:	People are nearly twice as likely to be in fair or poor health in the
unhealthiest counties, according to a press release from County Health Rankings.

3225:	Unhealthy counties have significantly lower high school graduation rates, twice
as many children in poverty, fewer grocery stores and farmers markets and higher
rates of unemployment.

3226:	With a high percentage of smokers and adult obesity and a high number of
sexually transmitted diseases, Madison County ranked 91st in health behaviors,
leading county health officials, hospitals and clinics to create initiatives to
improve health.

3227:	Grimes said through the Public Health System Quality Improvement Process
(PHSQIP), the State Health Department sponsored the Madison Health Partners
Board, a group of health officials from local hospitals, to come together for
four weeks to share where the county was ranked, educate, inform and work
together.

3228:	"They had to choose a health initiative and a system plan," Karesa Knight,
executive director, Intersect Inc., said.

3229:	"The initiative was smoke-free air and
the system plan was to build on  more cohesive health in the community."

3230:	"We have worked with businesses including the City of Anderson and Red Gold to
train people to hold classes for their employees," Knight said.

3231:	"In 2009 (and)
2010 we received quality of life grants to work with physicians, dentists and
anyone in the health field to refer to the quit line," Knight said.

3232:	She helped work with health service providers to implement the "two A's and R":
Ask at every visit if the patient uses tobacco, assess them if willing to quit
and refer them to either a pharmacy for medication.

3233:	"If a health provider encourages a patient to quit, they are twice as likely
to," she said.

3234:	Area hospitals like St. John's Hospital are recruiting primary and specialty
care physicians in addition to expanding with dialysis centers, oncology,
endocrinology and geriatrics.

3235:	Beyond physician and specialty care recruitment, screening services and
assistance to those underinsured or not insured have increased.

3236:	"At Community, we offer weight management classes and programs for adults
and kids, routine free health screenings for our community, support groups and
educational classes, smoking cessation programs and countless other
opportunities for individuals to better their health."

3237:	VanNess added that it is the job of the hospital to offer these types of
opportunities and more to patients.

3238:	The problem is that the hospital cannot
force a person to alter his or her choices and choose a healthier lifestyle.

How your hospital fared on state report card

BYLINE: By Robert McCoppin Health & Fitness Reporter rmccoppin@dailyherald.com

Patients can compare rankings of Illinois hospitals for a wide range of
performance and cost measurements on a new Web site that debuted Thursday.

3243:	The Illinois Hospital Report Card, for the first time, ranks hospitals and
surgery centers based on quality of care, infections, complications, staffing
and cost, along with other criteria.

3244:	The site, by the Illinois Department of Public Health at
healthcarereportcard.illinois.gov or at idph.state.il.us, was so popular it
crashed twice before getting back up.

3245:	Consumers can choose which hospitals and which criteria they want to compare by
facility, county, or geographic radius.

3246:	Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, for instance, ranked in the
top three among local hospitals in all three quality of care measures, which
rated how often a hospital followed recommended treatments for pneumonia, heart
attack and heart failure patients.

3247:	Many hospitals struggled with patient satisfaction, with the rankings among
local hospitals ranging from 76 to 44 percent who were highly satisfied.

3248:	Central
DuPage

Hospital in Winfield topped the list among local hospitals, while Adventist
GlenOaks in Glendale Heights came in lowest.

3249:	The national average for highly satisfied patients is 64 percent.

3250:	Jacqueline Conrad, chief nursing officer at Adventist GlenOaks in Glendale
Heights, noted that the survey results are a year old, and said her hospital has
made great strides trying to improve patient satisfaction since then.

3251:	GlenOaks started a program last year to build morale and engagement among
front-line caregivers, training employees to introduce themselves and describe
their background to patients, and explain any procedures they're about to go
through.

3252:	"We recognize the patients are at their most vulnerable when they come to a
hospital, and we want to reduce their anxiety," Conrad said.

3253:	Some criteria seem quirky but mean a lot to patients.

3254:	Among the local hospitals,
Delnor Community in Geneva kept patient rooms the quietest at night and Centegra
Northern Illinois Medical Center in McHenry responded to call buttons most
consistently.

3255:	Advocate Good Shepherd Hospital in Barrington came up as the lowest cost among
local hospitals for numerous procedures.

3256:	Advocate Condell in Libertyville often
came out on the top of the cost list.

3257:	So many factors go into cost, Good Shepherd spokesman Mike Deering said, it's
hard to explain why.

3258:	But he said hospitals are very mindful of cost, avoiding
unnecessary stays and unnecessary tests, for instance.

3259:	The cost data on the site is probably the least useful, because most fees are
negotiated lower with insurers or patients, said Ian Jones, vice president for
clinical performance at Sherman Hospital in Elgin, which came in around the
middle of most cost comparisons for local hospitals.

3260:	In general, he said of the rankings, "Anything that sheds light on medical care
and outcomes that patients can access is a good thing."

3261:	After years of operating in obscurity, hospitals are increasingly being judged
online at a variety of sites.

3262:	Also Thursday, at the national level, America's Health Rankings rated Illinois
29th among states for its overall health, crediting us for a high number of
primary care physicians, but dinging us for pollution and a high rate of binge
drinking.

3263:	Those rankings are based on community behavior, the environment, health policy
and clinical care.

3264:	Consumers also can find performance data at the Hospital Compare Site at the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Illinois Hospital
Association is working on a Web site to compile patient safety, satisfaction and
performance data.

Berkshire Medical Center earns top ratings for care

LENGTH: 477 words


PITTSFIELD -- Berkshire Medical Center has received five-star ratings and top
national rankings for clinical quality from HealthGrades, the leading
independent health care ratings organization.

3266:	The recognition is based on HealthGrades' 12th annual Hospital Quality in
America study, which analyzes patient outcomes at virtually all of the nation's
hospitals, using publicly available data.

3267:	In the 2010 HealthGrades ratings, BMC achieved national recognition for cardiac
services, pulmonary services, stroke services and critical care services.

3268:	BMC
was honored with the 2010 Pulmonary Care Excellence Award, achieving a ranking
among the top 5 percent in the nation for pulmonary services, and the 2010
Stroke Care Excellence Award, ranking BMC among the top 10 percent in the nation
for stroke services.

3269:	"These accomplishments relate to important services for our community in areas
of care that our families and friends will likely need at some point in their
lives," said Diane Kelly, chief operating officer of BMC.

3270:	"When we are
recognized for being the absolute best in an area like critical care, our
patients can be confident that the same level of commitment to high quality care
will be there for them in all of our services."

3271:	"It is clear from the continuing national recognition, as found in the latest
HealthGrades rankings, that patients of Berkshire Medical Center receive the
highest quality care, on a par with the best hospitals in the country," said
David Phelps, president and CEO of Berkshire Health Systems.

3272:	The HealthGrades study, the largest annual report of its kind, analyzed patient
outcomes in nearly 40 million Medicare hospitalization records from 5,000
hospitals over the years 2006, 2007 and 2008.

3273:	This year's study found:

n Across all 17 procedures and diagnoses in which mortality was studied, there
was an approximate 72 percent lower chance of dying in a five-star rated
hospital compared to a one-star rated hospital, and a 52 percent lower chance of
dying in a five-star hospital compared with the national average.

3274:	n If all hospitals performed at the level of a five-star rated hospital across
the 17 procedures and diagnoses studied, 224,537 Medicare lives could
potentially have been saved from 2006 through 2008.

3275:	HealthGrades' hospital ratings and awards reflect the track record of patient
outcomes at hospitals in the form of mortality and complication rates.

3276:	HealthGrades rates hospitals independently based on data that hospitals submit
to the federal government.

3277:	More information on the HealthGrades study, can be found at www.healthgrades.com

Primary named one of top children's hospitals in nation

BYLINE: By Lisa Rosetta The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 410 words


Primary Children's Medical Center was ranked among the top 30 children's
hospitals in the country based on a three-part mix of reputation, low death rate
and other care-related factors, according to U.S. News & World Report.

3279:	Children's hospitals, which in the past were lumped together with all other
hospitals in the news magazine's annual ranking, were examined in a stand-alone
report published in its Sept. 3 issue, which hit newsstands Monday.

3280:	The top three hospitals were Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Children's
Hospital Boston and Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.

3281:	Primary Children's - which was ranked 18th overall - received the highest score
of all children's hospitals in the category of death rate, meaning its mortality
rates for key procedures were lower than the 113 hospitals who responded to the
news magazine's survey.

3282:	Each hospital's mortality was ranked on a 0 to 6 point scale, based on the
mortality rates and the total number of key procedures.

3283:	Primary Children's was the only children's hospital
receiving the full 6 points.

3284:	Among the procedures considered were heart and neurosurgery operations, as well
as bone marrow transplants.

3285:	Hospitals had to meet a minimum volume requirement
for each procedure and achieve an acceptable death rate to receive points.

3286:	"This recognition in U.S. News and World Report confirms something that we've
known for years - that we have one of the best children's hospitals in the
country," said Primary Children's CEO Joe Mott in a news release.

3287:	The hospitals' scores for reputation were based on a survey of 100
board-certified pediatricians, adolescent medicine specialists and
neonatologists.

3288:	A medical facility was considered eligible for this year's rankings if
classified by the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related
Institutions as a free-standing children's hospital or as a children's hospital
within a hospital - a large multidisciplinary pediatric service within a medical
center.

3289:	In March, 122 hospitals met this standard, and 113 responded to the
survey.

July 15--A few of the area's hospitals received high marks and were recognized
for providing some of the best specialty care in the nation, according to U.S.
News & World Report's Best Hospitals rankings released today.

3291:	The 25th annual report compiles data in 16 adult specialties for nearly 5,000
medical centers in the U.S.

3292:	Nationally ranked hospitals received a gold
designation and high-performing hospitals just outside the national rank
received the silver grade.

3293:	Lancaster General Hospital was the fifth-best in Pennsylvania and was among the
nation's top-ranked hospitals in diabetes and endocrinology; gastroenterology;
orthopedics; and pulmonology.

3294:	For the 2014-15 report, only 144 hospitals performed well enough to be
nationally ranked in one or more specialties.

3295:	Officials from U.S. News & World Report say the annual rankings are designed to
help patients with serious conditions find hospitals that excel in treating
challenging cases.

3296:	Nationally, the top three hospitals were the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore, Md.

3297:	CHAM continues to lead the way in providing highly-sophisticated care to
children and families from around the community, around the country and around
the world.

3298:	"Our talented pediatric specialists and exceptional care teams at CHAM are
renowned for providing high quality care to children with complex medical
needs," said Judy Aschner, M.D., physician-in-chief, CHAM, and Michael I. Cohen,
M.D., university chair and professor of pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of
Medicine.

3299:	"We are delighted to be recognized by U.S. News & World Report for our
excellent outcomes in multiple pediatric subspecialties and for delivery of
advanced, evidence-based therapies and care coordination for the children under
our care."

3300:	-Over 90 percent of patients undergoing bone marrow transplant survive more than
100 days after therapy.

3301:	* Gastroenterology & GI Surgery ranked number 30 in the nation this year,

for biliary atresia and complex endoscopy procedures.

3303:	* Orthopedics ranks number 23 - reflecting the high numbers of patients choosing
CHAM for their orthopedic surgery care and the excellent outcomes produced by
the team, particularly for scoliosis procedures.

3304:	U.S. News introduced the Best Children's Hospitals rankings in 2007 to help
families of children with rare or life-threatening illnesses find the best
medical care available.

3305:	The rankings methodology considers
clinical outcomes, such as mortality and infection rates, efficiency and
coordination of care delivery and compliance with "best practices."

3306:	This year's rankings
will be published in the U.S. News & World Report's "Best Hospitals 2018"
guidebook and available on newsstands September 12.

Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Once Again Among US News & World Report's
Top Children's Hospitals

LENGTH: 362  words


June 21 -- The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has once again ranked
among the country's finest in the 2016-17 U.S. News & World Report's Honor Roll
of Best Children's Hospitals announced June 21.

3308:	The annual U.S. News rankings highlight the top 50 U.S. hospitals in each of
these pediatric specialties: cancer, cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and
endocrinology, gastroenterology and GI surgery, neonatology, nephrology,
neurology and neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology, and urology.

3309:	"To be ranked among the top pediatric hospitals is an honor, which reflects our
commitment to provide the optimum care for every child and family we serve,"
said Madeline Bell, president and chief executive officer of The Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia.

3310:	"The level of clinical excellence among the hospitals
evaluated makes our inclusion gratifying and I am proud of our dedicated and
talented physicians, nurses and clinical support staff for their efforts on
behalf of our patients," Bell said.

3311:	The U.S. News survey methodology combines clinical and operational data, results
from a reputational survey of board-certified pediatric specialists, and
supplemental information from resources such as the National Cancer Institute.

3312:	Most of the 183 facilities surveyed for the 2016-17 Best Children's Hospitals
rankings are either freestanding children's hospitals or a "hospital within a
hospital" - a large and essentially autonomous multidisciplinary pediatric
department within a major medical center.

3313:	In the 2016-17 rankings, 78 of the 183
surveyed hospitals were ranked in one or more specialties.

3314:	The Best Children's
Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes hospitals with scores in the top 10 percent in
at least three specialties.

3315:	The 2016-17 Honor Roll lists 11 such hospitals.

3316:	The 2016 edition features presidents and CEOs
of hospitals and health systems who also hold medical degrees.

3317:	"It is a dynamic
group of individuals who are helping to define the future of our health care."

3318:	Each of the recipients has demonstrated outstanding leadership and clinical
expertise throughout their careers, leading initiatives to improve their
individual organizations and the health care of the communities they serve.

3319:	His pioneering work led to the
development of lenalidomide (Revlimid) from the laboratory to clinical trials,
which went on to receive fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and approval for the treatment of patients with MDS and multiple
myeloma.

3320:	Serving patients from all 50 states and more than 100
countries, Moffitt boasts patient outcomes that beat the national average.

3321:	The Becker's Hospital Revieweditorial team selected hospitals for inclusion
based on editorial judgment and discretion, and nominations were considered when
making selections for this list.

3322:	Additionally, based on its Community Value
Index score, Augusta Health ranked as a Community Value 100 Hospital-one of the
100 best hospitals in the nation for value to its community in the 10th annual
Community Value Index Study.

3323:	"Every physician and employee at Augusta Health is dedicated to providing the
best care possible with the most reasonable charges possible to their friends,
family and neighbors," said Mary N. Mannix, FACHE and CEO of Augusta Health.

3324:	The Community Value Index score, calculated annually by Cleverley + Associates,
provides a relative ranking that benchmarks hospitals against hospitals in a
peer group by measuring four areas-hospital quality performance, financial
viability and plant reinvestment, hospital cost structure and hospital charge
structure.

3325:	Fundamentally, the Community Value Index asserts that a hospital
provides value to its community when it provides high quality care to its
patients, is financially viable, is appropriately reinvesting back into the
facility, maintains a low cost structure and has reasonable charges.

3326:	Hospitals operating with a high Community Value Index are low cost, low charge,
and use their strong financial position to reinvest back into the provision of
quality care at their facility.

3327:	Hospitals in the top 20% are designated
"Community Value Five Star" facilities, and the highest scoring hospitals in
this group are designated the "Community Value 100" hospitals.

3328:	Becker's "100 Great Community Hospitals" list includes hospitals with fewer than
550 beds that are dedicated to high quality care and service to the community.

3329:	The editorial team selects these community hospitals based on ranking and awards
from iVantage Health Analytics, Truven Health Analytics, HealthGrades and The
Joint Commission-all rankings of quality and service.

3330:	Becker's notes that
hospitals do not pay and cannot pay to be included on the list.

3331:	HSN
is staging a sweepstakes this time with more than $200,000 in prizes to people
who register online at hsn.com.

3332:	Prizes include dinner with Emeril
Lagasse at his New Orleans restaurant, a party for 10 organized by Oprah's home
entertainment guru Colin Cowie, and a $5,000 room makeover by decorator Nate
Berkus.

3333:	The Healthcare Financial
Management Association has analyzed 1,500 hospitals nationwide by the relative
value of care they provide.

3334:	Such rankings could affect hospital reimbursements,
as the federal government considers proposals to pay hospitals based on the
value of the care they provide.

3335:	Fed meets, but don't expect much

The Federal Reserve Board meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the betting is
that we won't seeaction on interest rates until August.

3336:	The Fed would like to see signs
that the economy is improving before putting a damper on borrowing with higher
rates.

3337:	This could spoil your appetite

Regions Financial chief economist Bob Allsbrook will talk about recession and
stagflation Wednesday at a Tampa Chamber of Commerce breakfast.

3338:	The magazine will publish its annual top-50 rankings in 17 specialties at
www.usnews.com/Besthospitals today and in its July 18 edition on sale Monday.

3339:	No
other Dayton-area hospital is among the 176 medical centers to be listed.

3340:	"Everybody has heard of this honor and patients use the Best Hospitals issue as
a reference tool," Grandview President Roy Chew said Thursday.

3341:	Unlike some other hospital rankings, U.S. News does not require hospitals it
recognizes to pay application or licensing fees.

3342:	It evaluates all 6,007
nongovernmental U.S. hospitals.

3343:	Criteria for the rankings include mortality rates, patient volume,
nurse-to-patient ratios, technology, patients' services and reputation, based on
surveys of board-certified physicians.

3344:	The heavily weighted reputation scores
tend to favor hospitals in the large markets or those affiliated with
universities.

3345:	Grandview overcame its 0.0 percent reputation scores by having the lowest listed
mortality rate in neurology and neurosurgery, adjusted for patients' severity,
and the second-lowest in respiratory care.

A health care information company once again has counted Seven Rivers Community
Hospital among the nation's top 100 hospitals.

3356:	The company, Illinois-based Solucient, bases its rankings on quality of care and
efficiency, among other factors.

3357:	In 1999 the company, then known as HCIA-Sachs, included Seven Rivers as one of
the top 100 U.S. hospitals.

3358:	A year later it counted Seven Rivers among the
nation's top 100 hospitals for treating stroke patients.

3359:	"To think
that we are among the top 100 hospitals when compared to the nearly 6,000 across
the country - it's just a wonderful achievement."

3362:	Several other Pennsylvania hospitals were ranked among the top 50 in the nation
for high performance in particular specialties.

3363:	No New Jersey hospitals made any of the lists.

Local hospitals earn above average ratings

BYLINE: Christena T. O'Brien, Leader-Telegram, Eau Claire, Wis.

3370:	22--The federal government's latest survey of hospital patients is out, and
for the first time, the ratings are available for all Chippewa Valley hospitals.

3371:	Ranked highest for overall patient satisfaction was OakLeaf Surgical Hospital.

3372:	Among full-service hospitals, Luther Midelfort, St. Joseph's Hospital, Red Cedar
Medical Center and Sacred Heart Hospital also received overall scores above the
statewide and national averages.

3373:	The rankings, available on Medicare's "Hospital Compare" Web site, are based on
patient surveys required by the federal government.

3374:	The surveys gauge how well
doctors and nurses communicate, whether patients believe they received help in a
timely manner, and whether they would recommend a hospital to others.

3375:	Of the five local facilities, 97 percent of patients responding to the survey
said they'd recommend OakLeaf; 79 percent of Luther Midelfort patients, 78
percent of Sacred Heart patients, 76 percent of St. Joseph's patients and 73
percent of Red Cedar's patients reported the same.

3376:	"I think patient satisfaction is one of the areas specialty hospitals excel in,"
he said.

3377:	"We're smaller, so I think we can respond to patients' needs
better."

3378:	That said, unlike full-service hospitals, OakLeaf solely focuses on surgery
patients, he noted.

3379:	The results of the patient surveys were first released by some hospitals,
including Luther Midelfort, last year.

3380:	The government required all hospitals to
disclose their survey results this year.

3381:	The surveys are limited only to patients requiring an overnight stay.

3382:	"I think we're fortunate
to have good health care in the Chippewa Valley."

3383:	That said, officials at Luther Midelfort are always looking for ways to improve.

3384:	"We know it's not always a patient's first choice to come to a medical facility,
so we're always trying to make the experience the best it can be," she said.

3385:	In some cases, specific measures such as the percentage of surgery patients
given the right antibiotic at the right time might be important but not relevant
to most people.

3386:	A study published late last year in Health Affairs, a policy journal, found that
the rankings vary widely.

3387:	Still, the Health Affairs study noted that patients want to know about other
patients' experiences: Did patients receive help quickly from the staff?

3388:	Those are among the 10 measures of patient satisfaction available on the "
Hospital Compare" site.

3389:	Hospitals have long surveyed patients on what they thought of their care.

St. John's Hospital is one of the nation's 100 best hospitals for cardiovascular
care, an Evanston-based health-care information company said Monday.

3392:	The ranking from Solucient follows recent five-star ratings for heart care for
St. John's from HealthGrades, another company that helps hospitals analyze their
ability to provide high-quality care.

3393:	"This latest recognition underscores the
fact that our patients have access to health care that is among the best in the
nation," St. John's executive vice president Richard Carlson said in a news
release.

3394:	"Prairie prides itself on maintaining a value base of excellence, which ensures
our patients do well not only while in the hospital, but as they return to an
active lifestyle at home," Prairie Heart Institute executive director Jim Zito
said in the news release.

3395:	Unlike with some health-care award programs, hospitals do not pay any money to
be considered for the Solucient ranking.

3396:	The company analyzes hospitals
nationwide using data that hospitals generate when caring for Medicare patients.

3397:	St. John's last placed among the top 100 hospitals for heart care in 1999.

3398:	"We don't know why we weren't scored in there," said Michael Schroyer,
Memorial's executive director of cardiac and vascular services, noting that
Memorial has received five-star ratings from HealthGrades in the past.

3399:	Schroyer noted that most of the cardiologists who provide heart care at both
hospitals are members of the same physician group practice, and Springfield's
heart surgeons practice at both hospitals.

3400:	Solucient says it scores hospitals on factors such as death rates, medical
complications and length of stay for patients undergoing various types of heart
surgery, as well as conditions such as heart attack and congestive heart
failure.

3401:	The company also applies mathematical formulas to adjust for variations between
hospitals in the level of illness among their patients.

3402:	Solucient then compares each hospital's performance to the performance of their
"peer" hospitals.

3403:	The company doesn't reveal which of the top 100 hospitals
perform the best overall.

3404:	Instead, it breaks down the top hospitals into three
categories.

3405:	St. John's was one of 40 top-ranked institutions that are "teaching hospitals" -
meaning they help to train young doctors in residency programs - but don't offer
specific training programs in cardiovascular care.

3406:	Other hospitals in the group containing St. John's included St. James Hospital
and Health Centers in Olympia Fields, and hospitals in Des Moines, Iowa, San
Diego, Baltimore, Phoenix and Salt Lake City.

Emory ranked among best research facilities

BYLINE: Ann Hardie; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg.

3413:	"It's gratifying to see Emory's accomplishments recognized yet again," said Dr.
Michael Johns, head of the Emory's health care system.

3414:	"Nothing has changed about our organization or operation except to improve it,"
said Pat Sodomka, the Medical College's executive director.

3415:	The magazine was quick to say that the lists in the fields ranging from AIDS to
geriatrics are not an indication of a hospital's worthiness, but rather a tool
for consumers shopping for health care.

3416:	The magazine, which has been ranking hospitals since 1990, this year considered
1,961 comprehensive, major medical centers with teaching and research
components.

3417:	In 12 specialties, reputation among specialists, death rate and other medical
data each accounted for one-third of a hospital's score.

3418:	school trustees are asking Education Minister Shirley Bond to take steps to
prevent the Fraser Institute from using annual test results in its controversial
ranking of elementary schools.

3419:	BCSTA members at a provincial council meeting Saturday voted unanimously to ask
the education ministry to "revise its policy relating to the release of
assessment data sets, specifically the FSA results to external bodies such as
the Fraser Institute, so that access for the purposes of ranking or
identification of schools is no longer allowed."

3420:	Mike Lombardi, a trustee who attended the meeting on behalf of the Vancouver
board of education, said BCSTA members suggested that Bond follow the example of
Health Minister George Abbott's policy on hospital rankings.

3421:	The government and health authorities refused to divulge the names of hospitals
checked for 39 quality indicators, meaning hospitals were identified by numbers
only.

3422:	Peter Cowley, director of school performance studies at the Fraser Institute,
which posts elementary school rankings online, said the BCSTA move shows it has
no interest in either improving performance by comparing schools or being
accountable to taxpayers.

3423:	"These people are saying, 'Let's take the taxpayers' money from a public
enterprise, and not tell them about the results.'

3424:	In an opinion piece for The Vancouver Sun, Simon Fraser University public policy
professor John Richards said FSA tests are integral to research.

3425:	The Leapfrog Group's Spring 2016 Hospital Safety Score update assigned letter
grades to more than 2,500 U.S. hospitals, assessing medical errors, accidents,
injuries and infections.

3426:	The study also found that patients in lower-ranking hospitals nationwide have a
much greater risk of avoidable death when compared to "A" hospitals -- 9 percent
higher in "B" grade hospitals, 35 percent in "C" hospitals, and an astounding 50
percent higher in "D" And "F" hospitals.

3427:	Of the 2,751 hospitals in the study, 798 received an "A," 639 a "B," 957 a "C",
162 a "D" and 15 got an "F."

Last fall, the Leapfrog Group gave NOCH a "B" grade.

3428:	"It just reinforces that North Ottawa Community Hospital is a presence in the
community as a provider of high-quality health care," said Susan McKinnon,
director of quality for the Grand Haven hospital.

3429:	"We are and continue to be a
reliable, high-quality source for health care in our community.

3430:	But there's
always opportunity for improvement.

3431:	NOCH scored high in doctor communication skills -- 84 percent of patients
surveyed said their doctors always communicated well, above the 81 percent state
average and 82 percent national average.

3432:	Ninety percent of patients reported they were were always given information on
what to do while recovering at home.

3433:	More than 81 percent of NOCH patients said their nurses communicated well.

3434:	NOCH's rankings show potential need for improvement in the areas of care
transitions (51 percent reported positive results, a tick below the 52 percent
state and national averages) and in explaining medicines before patients took
them (60 percent positive rankings, compared to 64 percent in the state and 65
nationally).

3435:	"Even though we excelled in areas, we don't want to lose our traction there
because we always have the opportunity to improve," McKinnon said.

3436:	"If you look at our employee base, many of these employees live in the
community," she said.

3437:	"The patients our employees are taking care of are their
friends, their neighbors, the people they see at church, at the grocery store,
the people who sit beside them at music at the park.

3438:	"That truly is the patients reporting how they felt their care was delivered in
the organization," she said.

nurses, it's everyone -- right down to how clean your room was.

Sept. 08--TERRE HAUTE -- Union Hospital's ranking as a top national-level
employer wasn't a surprise to the employees who made it so, but definitely an
honor.

3451:	And Jamie Gregory was quick to answer that she's not looking to change employers
any time soon.

3452:	Union
Hospital ranks among the nation's top 100 facilities, according to the
publication's study, and specific rankings will be released Oct. 25.

3453:	Interim CEO Scott Teffeteller made the announcement Tuesday afternoon inside the
hospital's employee breakroom to a crowd of enthusiasts.

3454:	There are approximately 6,000 hospitals in America, he said after the
announcement, adding that Modern Healthcare Magazine is one of the nation's
largest trade publications for the industry.

3455:	The rankings are based on employee
surveys measuring facility leadership, training and overall culture, he said.

3456:	Union Hospital has been named one of Indiana's best employers on numerous
occasions, he said.

3457:	Sally Zuel, vice president of human resources, said it's particularly important
to note that the facility's employees gave their employer this award.

3458:	"Our employees are the heart of Union
Hospital."

3459:	With nearly 2,400 employees, it's tough to keep everyone happy, she said.

3460:	From onsite exercise facilities and programs to employee picnics,
longevity awards and achievement recognition, Zuel attributed "multiple
initiatives" as the cause of their worker satisfaction.

3461:	Both Zuel and Teffeteller said employee satisfaction is important, because happy
employees are more productive.

3462:	"The real winners are our families, our neighbors and our friends who continue
to receive wonderful health care," Teffeteller said.

3463:	Gregory attributed her overall satisfaction to good management, good colleagues
and a positive atmosphere.

3464:	The top 100 hospitals will be individually ranked Oct. 25.

AN overcrowded emergency department and lengthening elective surgery waiting
lists are believed to be among the reasons why the public satisfaction rate with
the Albury hospital ranks the second lowest among hospitals of a similar size.

3470:	Albury received a score of 74.2 out of 100 in an annual report recording the
experiences of public patients.

3471:	Albury Wodonga Health chief Dr Stuart Spring believes the result in the "good to
very good" category has been achieved in spite of the problems experienced by
the health service.

3472:	He credits the work of medical staff at the hospital in helping the hospital to
its ranking.

3473:	There is good news for other public hospitals in the region with Wodonga scoring
79.3, while Northeast Health Wangaratta's score of 82 placed them in the "very
good to excellent" category, ranking them among the leaders across Victoria.

3474:	The value of quality staff and the provision of care to patients coupled with
respect has been highlighted in the good results achieved by the region's
leading hospitals.

3475:	Attention to issues at Albury will go a long way to lifting its satisfaction
ranking in the future.

Web site grades hospitals on quality of care, satisfaction

BYLINE: Kevin Smith, San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Calif.

3486:	The Web site -- the result of a partnership between the California HealthCare
Foundation, UC San Francisco Institute for Health Policy Studies, and California
Hospitals Assessment and Reporting Taskforce -- offers comprehensive information
on more than 200 hospitals, representing 70 percent of all hospital admissions
in the state.

3487:	Hospitals are rated on 50 performance indicators, including patient satisfaction
and specific conditions ranging from maternity services to heart disease
treatment.

3488:	"We worked with consumer focus groups to make sure we designed the Web display
in a way that would work for patients and families," said Maribeth Shannon, who
directs the Market and Policy Monitor program for the California HealthCare
Foundation.

3489:	"The benefit of this Web site is that it encourages improvement in
hospitals."

3490:	Huntington Hospital in Pasadena earned an average quality-of-care rating for
treatment of heart attack and superior rankings in the areas of patient
satisfaction and timeliness of care.

3491:	Seventy-eight percent of heart attack patients indicated they would recommend
the hospital.

3492:	In the maternity patient satisfaction category, 91 percent of patients said they
would recommend Huntington Memorial.

3493:	Kaiser Permanente Baldwin Park Medical Center garnered an above-average rating
in the quality-of-care category for heart attack and a superior medical patient
satisfaction ranking.

3494:	R. Adams Dudley, associate professor of medicine and health policy at UC San
Francisco and project director for the Institute for Health Policy Studies, said
the Web site ratings are adjusted for differences in the patient mix.

3495:	"When you do patient surveys, for example, maternity patients are always happier
than other types of patients," he said.

3496:	Surgical patients likewise tend to be happier than medical patients because
"when they leave the hospital they go home with their problem fixed," Dudley
said.

3497:	Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in Whittier nabbed a superior rating for
heart attack care and a superior patient satisfaction ranking.

Lima Memorial top hospital for infection prevention

BYLINE: John Bush, The Lima News, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 520 words


Aug. 11--LIMA -- Lima Memorial Health System has been rated one of the best
hospitals in the United States for infection prevention.

3500:	A recent study by Consumer Reports revealed Lima Memorial is one of nine
hospitals in the U.S. that achieved the magazine's top ranking in avoiding
bacteria known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium
difficile, as well as three other infections.

3501:	The ranking is based on data hospitals reported to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention between October 2013 and September 2014.

3502:	A policy Ellis said has been extremely effective is the antibiotic stewardship
program, which is meant to ensure patients get the right drug at the right time
and with the proper dose.

3503:	Ellis said one of the biggest ways to fight infection in a hospital like Lima
Memorial is to simply practice proper hand-washing techniques.

3504:	Going forward, Ellis said Lima Memorial will continue to be one of the country's
top hospitals for infection prevention if the staff stays vigilant and the
administration continues to implement effective policies.

Aug. 02--Two Pennsylvania hospitals were among the best in the country,
according to the annual U.S. News & World Report rankings released Tuesday.

3507:	Among the 20 "Honor Roll" hospitals in the U.S., the Hospitals of the University
of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian in Philadelphia was ninth and the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian-Shadyside moved up a position from
last year to 12th.

3508:	The 27th annual rankings compare nearly 5,000 medical centers across the country
in 25 specialties, procedures and conditions.

3509:	The rankings adjust for factors
such as income and credit hospitals that make data public in cardiology and
heart surgery.

3510:	"We strive to provide patients with the highest-quality information on hospitals
available," Ben Harder, chief of health analysis at U.S. News, said in a
statement.

3511:	"Driving for broader transparency and evaluating hospitals in a
comprehensive, fair way reflects that mission."

3512:	The
Medicare report ranked hospitals for quality from one to five stars.

3513:	Some hospital lobbyists and officials have criticized the Medicare ratings,
arguing they need to be adjusted more for issues like poverty and treating
patients with complex health issues.

3514:	Officials with the federal government have said they created the rating system
to provide more information about the care available at area hospitals.

Two Utah hospitals - LDS Hospital and University Hospitals and Clinics - were
among 173 in the country to earn a spot in U.S. News & World Report's "America's
Best Hospitals" guide, on newsstands today.

3517:	"It is always gratifying to be recognized as one of the best, and this really
reflects the hard work and dedication of our faculty and staff," said David
Entwistle, University Hospitals and Clinics' CEO.

3518:	The magazine initially evaluated 5,462 hospitals based on three standards:
membership in the Council of Teaching Hospitals, affiliation with a medical
school and the availability of at least nine out of 18 key technologies, such as
shaped beam radiation and advanced cancer therapy.

3519:	To be ranked among the top 50 in a specialty, such as gynecology, a hospital had
to meet one of two requirements: It must have treated a minimum number of
Medicare or Medicaid patients who had specific conditions or underwent certain
procedures during a three-year period, or it had to be named among the best by
at least one physician in the latest three annual surveys.

3520:	Of the 173 hospitals that are ranked in this year's guide, 18 earned "honor
roll" status by ranking at or near the top in at least six specialties.

3521:	Pediatric hospitals will be ranked separately in the Sept. 3 issue of U.S. News
& World Report, on newsstands Aug. 27.

3522:	For the first time, three New York hospitals made the U.S. News and World Report
ranking of the nation's top 20 medical centers.

3523:	But for the first time, two other city institutions joined it on the magazine's
"honor roll" of outstanding hospitals: NYU Medical Center and Mount Sinai
Medical Center.

3524:	"We get the best medical students, the best residents.

3525:	The best doctors come here because they say
we are the best.

3526:	New York-Presbyterian, the nation's largest nonprofit, nonsectarian hospital,
sees 2 million patients a year, treats the most burns and performs the most
heart transplants.

3527:	That's fine.

3528:	That's fine, too," Pardes said.

3529:	The magazine looked at 4,861 medical centers, winnowing them down to 170
hospitals that were judged excellent in at least one of 16 specialties.

3530:	"Fewer than one half of 1% of hospitals received this honor.

3531:	The magazine's annual rankings carry a lot of influence - both among patients
looking for care and doctors looking for work, translating into money and

also ranks in the 93rd percentile nationally, which means that in quality
measures, Wesley ranks better than all other hospitals in the nation below the

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON - Massachusetts placed seventh in a national state-by-state ranking
of health care quality by the Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance
Health System.

3555:	The rankings, made public today, were broken down according to access to health
care, prevention and treatment, avoidable hospital use and costs, equity, and
healthy lives of citizens.

3556:	Nationwide, the study found wide variations in health care quality among the
states and reported that insurance coverage and affordability are growing
concerns.

3557:	Massachusetts was first among all states in access, and made the Top 10 in all
other areas except avoidable hospital use and costs, where it came in at 33.

3558:	There's
an educational cost factor as well in educating the next generation of new
doctors and testing new technologies.

3559:	Despite the blemish in avoidable hospital use and costs, Toni McGuire, president
and chief executive officer of the Great Brook Valley Health Center in
Worcester, said there is a lot to be proud of in Massachusetts.

3560:	"We have really good primary care doctors, which is maybe why our numbers
are so high."

3561:	Jean C. Sullivan, director of the Center for Health Law and
Economics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said she was
concerned about the slight drop in rankings on equity measures.

3562:	Jennifer Kritz, spokeswoman for the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, had not yet
reviewed the full report but said the state is taking measures to improve health
care quality.

3563:	"Massachusetts now leads the nation in insurance coverage, and we have also seen
improved access to medical and dental care," she said.

3564:	"A state commission
recently issued recommendations for reforming how we pay for health care.

the country, Ms. Schoen of the Commonwealth Fund said.

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ranks as the 13th-best hospital
system in the country, according to a new survey of 5,462 health-care
institutions from U.S. News & World Report.

3571:	The annual U.S. News & World Report rankings, initiated in 1990 to help patients
identify the institutions best at tackling the toughest conditions and
procedures, is serious business for hospitals, which often incorporate the
accolades in their marketing campaigns.

UPMC hospitals should they be among the lucky doctors asked to participate in
the annual survey.

3573:	The recognition, she added, helps UPMC
compete for the leading researchers, clinicians and scientists, as well as
medical residents.

3574:	The rankings are the first time that Consumer Reports rated hospitals for
safety, using the most current data available at the time of the analysis.

3575:	The analysis includes information from government and independent sources on
1,159 hospitals in 44 states.

3576:	The authors also interviewed patients, physicians,
hospital administrators and safety experts; reviewed medical literature; and
looked at hospital inspections and investigations.

3577:	"The safety score gives patients a way to compare hospitals on patient safety
before selecting where to go for their care," AMH President Dave Braasch said.

3578:	"Our top ranking is validation of the efforts put forth each day by our
physicians and staff to ensure our patients receive excellent care."

3579:	"It's a demonstration of Alton Memorial Hospital's culture and the focus we have
given to rapid improvement events, process change, a quick response to
instilling best practices and communication," Braasch said.

3580:	To make the magazine's "Honor Roll," a medical center must rank at or

Sunday, Oct. 11PITTSFIELD -- Berkshire Medical Center has been ranked first in
both the state and New England in a nationwide study conducted by a Tennessee
firm that measures health-care value.

3599:	Nationally, BMC was ranked 86th out of the 4,500 hospitals that were considered
for the 2009-2010 Hospital Value Index by Data Advantage LLC of Nashville, a
privately held health-care information company that has specialized in providing
the healthcare and business communities with independent and objective
information about the country's hospital industry since 1992.

3600:	Only acute-care general service hospitals that participate in the Medicare
reimbursement program were considered for the Hospital Value Index, said Data
Advantage's senior adviser John Morrow.

3601:	Specialty hospitals, veterans hospitals,
and private health organizations that don't participate in federal programs were
excluded, he said.

3602:	The rankings are based on each hospital's quality, affordability, efficiency and
patient satisfaction performance under the Hospital Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) regulations.

3603:	The index is designed to use only objective,
verifiable, and quantitative data that are consistent and complete across the
country to ensure objective measurement rather than anecdotal evidence,
according to Data Advantage.

3604:	"I'm happy to see that we have
valuation from external organizations such as the index not just in top
performance in quality, but having done so in a cost-effective manner, which is
critical for any health-care system."

3605:	"These national achievements for Berkshire Medical Center are a testament to the
dedication of our medical staff, employees, trustees, and leadership team, and
reinforce our commitment to providing the highest level of quality care for our
patients," Phelps said in a written statement.

3606:	The company's previous rankings were focused on hospitals that are located
in the country's 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas.

3607:	Before the advent of the Hospital Index, no public measurement existed to
integrate efficiency, affordability and quality, Ellrodt said.

3608:	"In my mind what's exciting about this award and the Data Advantage approach is
to be able to look at quality and at what cost," Ellrodt said.

Hospital tops rankings for patient satisfaction

SECTION: Pg.

3610:	Marys Journal Argus

Across Ontario, there is one hospital to which patients under acute care or
emerging from acute care are most likely to recommend to others, compared to
other hospitals.

3611:	The Queen Street West facility received outstanding reviews in an annual survey
of patients across Ontario, the results of which were released to the media
earlier this week.

3612:	"These results reflect our healthcare team's unwavering commitment to providing
the very best care possible," said Dick Burgess, in a news release sent out by
the Huron Perth Healthcare Alliance (HPHA) that operates St. Marys Memorial
along with facilities in Stratford, Clinton and Seaforth.

3613:	"Whenever we see positive patient satisfaction results in St. Marys or at our
three other sites, it simply re-affirms to me that the direction we've been
taking, with an emphasis on patient engagement and patient family engagement, is
the right direction," Williams told the Journal Argus.

3614:	"We know from research that's been done that, when you start to look at quality
of care, how responsive you are to the patients is a big driver," he said,
adding the HPHA board has set a strategy of patient-centred care.

3615:	Williams noted that the categories in which St. Marys Memorial received top
marks included "all hospital peer groups" â\x80" meaning it runs the gamut from
small, rural facilities like those in St. Marys, Seaforth and Clinton, to
"community hospitals" like Stratford General, to big-city teaching hospitals and
region-wide providers.

3616:	We look forward to continuing to work hard to meet and exceed the
needs of those we are here to serve," Burgess said in the news release.

3617:	We can always get better .

MedCenterDisplay: Patients Prefer Digital Communications to Print

LENGTH: 455  words


New Delhi, Sept. 9 -- Three out of four patients and caregivers who viewed
hospital messaging on digital screens in eight hospitals in the U.S. found the
content enhanced the hospital experience and provided health information they
could use, according to a study by media and marketing research firm Arbitron,
Inc.



MedCenterDisplay, a leading provider of digital patient engagement networks for
hundreds of hospitals in the U.S., commissioned Arbitron to conduct on-site
interviews of adults who had viewed hospital and health-related information
running on flat screen monitors placed in hospital waiting areas and cafeterias.

3619:	"We believe these findings clearly reinforce the value in establishing a robust
patient engagement network that brings patients and hospitals together to
improve healthcare," said Gregg Tarquinio, Ph.D., chief executive officer of
MedCenterDisplay.

3620:	"Already hospitals that communicate key healthcare delivery
messages on digital screens are seeing lower readmissions and higher 'HCAHPS'
patient satisfaction scores."

3621:	Those surveyed found information on hospital news, general health news, and tips
on maintaining good health most interesting, ranking the information from 4.0 to
4.6 on a scale from 1 to 5.

3622:	These rankings mirror recent reports that healthcare
has become one of the highest search topics online.

3623:	The report also found that only one-third of all visitors to the hospital were
actually patients.

3624:	Two-thirds were family members and caregivers of patients,
which correlates with national estimates on the rising number of adult

CAMC Memorial building to open floor by floor;
Doctors to see patients Monday in 5th-floor offices

BYLINE: Kellen Henry, Staff writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

3638:	The Charleston division of West Virginia University's Health Sciences Center
will move some operations into the building's fifth-floor offices and clinics,
and doctors will begin seeing patients Monday, said David Ramsey, CAMC's chief
executive officer.

3639:	"Everybody's pretty excited about it, as a modern medical education facility,"
Ramsey said after the CAMC Board of Trustees met Wednesday.

3640:	The beds have already been placed at the hospital for use in
preparation and post-procedure observation, but need to be licensed by the
Health Care Authority.

3641:	The process could take several weeks, but the cost will
be only for the application fees.

3642:	Though CAMC hospitals admitted about 5 percent fewer patients this June than a
year ago, that doesn't reflect the actual number of beds occupied, said Larry
Hudson, CAMC's chief financial officer.

3643:	When patients stay longer than expected
or need observation without meeting the criteria for admissions, the hospital
can still need more beds.

3644:	The state authority must sign off
on major projects for West Virginia hospitals.

3645:	Hospitals are evaluated every three years by the ACS and receive a ranking of
their ability to provide emergency medical services.

3646:	"It will be a significant performance standard that will measure us with
hospitals around the country," Ramsey said.

3647:	Consumer Reports, using government reports and independent information on 2,031
hospitals across the country, ranked HealthAlliance Hospital as the safest
hospital in Massachusetts for the second year in a row.

3648:	In addition to the Consumer Reports' findings, HealthAlliance Hospital's awards
and achievements include an "A" hospital safety score from The Leapfrog Group; a
Tier 1 hospital ranking by most major health insurance plans, the best ranking
for quality metrics; a ranking as the fourth leading hospital in the state for
surviving a heart attack, two years in a row; a recipient of health care's Most
Wired Award, four years in a row; one of the first hospitals in the country to
commit to electronic medical records; and the only hospital-based complementary
care center in north Central Massachusetts.

3649:	Fit-Friendly

Milford Regional Medical Center has been recognized as a Platinum-Level
Fit-Friendly Worksite by the American Heart Association for helping employees
eat better and exercise more.

3650:	Platinum-level employers offer employees physical activity options in the
workplace; increase healthy eating options at the worksite; promote a wellness
culture in the workplace; implement at least nine criteria outlined by the
American Heart Association in the areas of physical activity, nutrition and
culture; and demonstrate measurable outcomes related to workplace wellness.

3651:	For more information about the Fit-Friendly Worksites program and how it is
helping to improve the health of Americans visit startwalkingnow.org.

3652:	Top ranking

Harrington HealthCare System's emergency departments in both Southbridge and
Webster rank among the top 49 healthcare systems in the country, or the top 2
percent, for short waiting times, according to statistics compiled by Becker's
Hospital Review.

3653:	The time
represents the average time patients spent in the emergency departments before
they were seen by a health care provider.

3654:	CMMS examines the emergency department
waiting times in more than 3,500 hospitals nationwide.

3655:	Accepting the award
was Arleen Smith, Harrington's director of preventive health; Nancy Johndrow,
administrative assistant for the TB Clinic; and Debra Vescera, the TB Clinic's
primary nurse.

3656:	"The recognition of our neonatology program is a testament to the high quality
care we provide to our hospital's most fragile newborn patients," said Dr.
Barbara Ostrov, interim chair of pediatrics at Penn State Children's Hospital,
in a news release.

3657:	The U.S. News rankings highlight the top 50 U.S. hospitals in each of 10
pediatric specialties: cancer, cardiology and heart surgery, diabetes and
endocrinology, gastroenterology, neonatology, nephrology, neurology and
neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

For the first time in its 27 year history of health care rankings, U.S. News &
World Report has listed a Colorado hospital on its Best Hospitals Honor Roll, a
list of the top hospitals in the country.

3660:	The University of Colorado Hospital the academic home for UCHealth, a nonprofit
health care system that includes five hospitals and more than 100 clinics
throughout Colorado muscled its way onto the 20th and final spot on the list,
distinguishing itself among 5,000 hospitals considered nationally.

3661:	It's a prestigious nod and a sign of the Aurora based hospital's continued
growth, said Will Cook, CEO and president.

3662:	Last year, the hospital handled nearly 101,000 emergency department visits and
cared for more than 46,000 inpatients.

3663:	More than 1,800
physicians and providers work at the hospital (out of a total of more than 6,000
employees), and its annual economic impact exceeds $4.5 billion, according to a
2014 report from the University of Colorado.

3664:	"We wouldn't have a ranking like this without our partnership with CU School of
Medicine, since we're the only academic medical center in the region," Cook
said.

3665:	"But we also wouldn't have it without our dedicated doctors, nurses and
staff.

3666:	Hospitals received points in the rankings if they were nationally ranked in one
of the 16 specialties the higher they ranked, the more points they got and how
many ratings of "high performing" they earned in the nine procedures and
conditions.

3667:	Other Colorado hospitals joining UCHealth on the list of best hospitals in the
state are: Porter Adventist Hospital of Denver (second), Medical Center of the
Rockies of Loveland (third), Penrose St. Francis Health Services of Colorado
Springs (fourth) and Poudre Valley Hospital of Fort Collins (fifth).

Web site grades hospitals on quality of care, satisfaction

Finding a good plumber or mechanic can be relatively easy.

3676:	The Web site - the result of a partnership between the California HealthCare
Foundation, UC San Francisco Institute for Health Policy Studies, and California
Hospitals Assessment and Reporting Taskforce - offers comprehensive information
on more than 200 hospitals, representing 70 percent of all hospital admissions
in the state.

3677:	Hospitals are rated on 50 performance indicators, including patient satisfaction
and specific conditions ranging from maternity services to heart disease
treatment.

3678:	"We worked with consumer focus groups to make sure we designed the Web display
in a way that would work for patients and families," said Maribeth Shannon, who
directs the Market and Policy Monitor program for the California HealthCare
Foundation.

3679:	"The benefit of this Web site is that it encourages improvement in
hospitals."

3680:	Huntington Hospital in Pasadena earned an average quality-of-care rating for
treatment of heart attack and superior rankings in the areas of patient
satisfaction and timeliness of care.

3681:	Seventy-eight percent of heart attack patients indicated they would recommend
the hospital.

3682:	In the maternity patient satisfaction category, 91 percent of patients said they
would recommend Huntington Memorial.

3683:	Kaiser Permanente Baldwin Park Medical Center garnered an above-average rating
in the quality-of-care category for heart attack and a superior medical patient
satisfaction ranking.

3684:	R. Adams Dudley, associate professor of medicine and health policy at UC San
Francisco and project director for the Institute for Health Policy Studies, said
the Web site ratings are adjusted for differences in the patient mix.

3685:	"When you do patient surveys, for example, maternity patients are always happier
than other types of patients," he said.

3686:	Surgical patients likewise tend to be happier than medical patients because
"when they leave the hospital they go home with their problem fixed," Dudley
said.

3687:	Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in Whittier nabbed a superior rating for
heart attack care and a superior patient satisfaction ranking.

The CBC's Fifth Estate recently broadcast Rate My Hospital, a "sweeping
cross-country investigation into Canada's hospitals.

3730:	Interviews of health system administrators trying to explain their poor ratings
only added to the sleaziness.

3731:	Yorkton Regional Health Centre spokesperson Sharon Tropin did an admirable job
explaining a D rating, criticizing the rating tool for having only five
indicators.

3732:	The Fifth Estate's website indicates the statistical methodology was developed
by biostatisticians noted for their work in evaluating health system
performance.

3733:	Here's how this data torture took place:

Hospital report card grades were determined by measuring the number of standard
deviations a hospital is from the average for all hospitals.

3734:	(Standard deviation
is a measure of the variability in the data.)

3735:	The expected operating range of any process is +/- 3 standard deviations.

3736:	Combined with the system of grades, this data torture transforms measured
ratings into ordinal rankings.

3737:	The CBC's report card proves nothing more than that, in a
ranking of hospitals (or anything else), some will be at the top, some at the
bottom, and about half will be below average.

3738:	The report card
standard deviations are the probabilities of obtaining a performance rating,
assuming hospitals are the cause.

3739:	The CBC measured the probability that a person would die
after jumping off Toronto's CN Tower.

3740:	They are ubiquitous
in reporting from provincial health systems, quality councils, health ministries
and the Canadian Institute for Healthcare Information.

3741:	But shouldn't the media
be exposing scientifically incompetent practices rather than promoting them?

3742:	The health-care system in Canada has enough problems.

3743:	Robert Gerst is a columnist for Troy Media and partner in charge of operational
excellence and research &statistical methods at Converge Consulting Group Inc.

3744:	He is author of "The Performance Improvement Toolkit: The Guide to
Knowledge-Based Improvement" and numerous articles in peer-reviewed
publications.

3745:	Dr. Loren Roth, chief medical officer of the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, distributed a letter to local physicians last month in which he
encouraged them to vote early and often for UPMC hospitals should they be among
the lucky doctors asked to participate in U.S. News & World Report magazine's
annual survey of "best hospitals."

3746:	Noting the medical center's recent success in the ranking by U.S. News -- UPMC
was rated this year as one of the 14 best hospitals in the nation -- Dr. Roth
told his physicians that: "We would like to build on this upward momentum.

3747:	"In the survey you may list one hospital, several hospitals, or all of
them."

3748:	While Dr. Roth was not available for comment yesterday, spokesman Frank
Raczkiewicz said health system officials have sent similar letters for the past

participation.

3749:	Mr. Raczkiewicz did not say how many physicians received the letter, which
encourages doctors who are surveyed by U.S. News to alert the marketing office
at UPMC so that officials can "update our database."

3750:	The September letter
encouraged doctors to submit their surveys in time for the Halloween deadline.

3751:	The U.S. News ranking has become a serious business for hospitals, which often
incorporate accolades from the magazine in their own marketing campaigns.

such, it's not surprising that hospitals including UPMC would work to get out
the vote, said Betsy Gelb, a professor of marketing and entrepreneurship at the
Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston.

3753:	Some experts in health care quality have long bemoaned the public attention
given to the magazine's rankings, in part because U.S. News uses a hospital's
reputation among physicians as one of its three main data points.

3754:	A Dartmouth
College study published in Health Affairs during 2004, for example, raised
questions about the magazine's methodology by finding that Medicare patients
with similar chronic conditions receive strikingly different care among
hospitals identified as "best" in geriatrics by U.S. News.

3755:	"They need
to really shift the ratings away from reputation and toward hard evidence --
that the right outcomes are being achieved, and the right processes are being
followed."

3756:	Dr. Loren Roth, chief medical officer of the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, distributed a letter to local physicians last month in which he
encouraged them to vote early and often for UPMC hospitals should they be among
the lucky doctors asked to participate in U.S. News & World Report magazine's
annual survey of "best hospitals."

3757:	Noting the medical center's recent success in the ranking by U.S. News -- UPMC
was rated this year as one of the 14 best hospitals in the nation -- Dr. Roth
told his physicians that: "We would like to build on this upward momentum.

3758:	"In the survey you may list one hospital, several hospitals, or all of
them."

3759:	While Dr. Roth was not available for comment yesterday, spokesman Frank
Raczkiewicz said health system officials have sent similar letters for the past
three years or so to remind physicians about the survey, and encourage their
participation.

Mayo Clinic Lauded in Quality Rankings, Most Recently by U.S. News & World
Report

LENGTH: 817  words


New Delhi, July 19 -- There are many external agencies that rate quality in
health care and Mayo Clinic is top ranked for quality by more well-known
national assessment organizations than any other academic medical center in the
nation.

3768:	While no single set of measures can
perfectly represent health care quality, we are proud to be recognized by so
many," says John Noseworthy, M.D., Mayo Clinic's president and CEO.

3769:	"We are
honored by this recognition, and we remain focused on our primary mission:
putting the needs of our patients first and creating for them the best possible,
most trusted and affordable model of health care for the future."

3770:	To make the magazine's "Honor Roll," a medical center has to rank at
or near the top in at least six specialties included in the rankings.

3771:	2 in ten of the 12 specialties that are
measured based on reputation, services and volumes, safety and clinical
outcomes.

3772:	"Our employees work diligently every day to make each patient's experience the
best it can be, and that's reflected in the fact that we consistently rank
highly in quality measurements," says Dr. Noseworthy.

3773:	"We have a deep commitment
to delivering the highest quality care that best meets patients' needs.

U.S. News gives kudos to suburban hospitals for their performance in 16
specialized areas, in their annual rankings published online Tuesday.

3788:	The publication puts these suburban hospitals in the top 25 percent nationally
in the specialties for which they were listed.

3789:	Forty-four of 121 Chicago area hospitals were ranked as "high performing" in one
or more specialties.

3790:	In most specialties the rankings rely on hard data for Medicare patients such as
death rates and number of patients.

3791:	Surveys of specialist physicians are
important, and ratio of nurses to patients is also taken into consideration.

3792:	Here are the suburban hospitals that made this year's list, how they rank in the
Chicago area, and the specialties labeled "high performing" by the publication.

3793:	Five major Chicago area hospitals were ranked best in the country: Northwestern
Memorial with national rankings in 13 specialties; University of Chicago in 12
areas; Rush University in 10 areas; Loyola University in four; University of
Illinois and Rehabilitation Institute each in one.

DATELINE: TAMPA


Two Tampa hospitals had a total of seven departments place among the nation's 50
best in the U.S. News & World Report's 2007 rankings.

3798:	Four medical specialties at Tampa General Hospital - gynecology, kidney disease,
urology and ear, nose and throat - made the list for the first time.

3799:	Only 173 of the country's 5,462 hospitals, or about 3.2 percent, made the top 50
in any category, said Avery Comarow, who edits the rankings.

3800:	To
determine reputation, U.S. News asks doctors to list the top five hospitals in
their field.

3801:	The rankings are meant to help patients with hard-to-treat conditions find the
best treatment, he said.

3802:	But Comarow cautioned patients not to depend solely on the ratings.

3803:	The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute again has been ranked
one of the nation's top hospitals for cancer treatment.

3804:	The July 17 issue of U.S. News & World Report rated Moffitt 22nd out of 50
hospitals.

3805:	"We feel that this is a reflection of our outstanding research and clinical
expertise and our continuing emphasis on bringing new discoveries to bear on the
treatment and care of our patients," Dr. John C. Ruckdeschel, the center's
director, said in a statement.

3806:	The magazine ranked hospitals in 16 specialties, including cancer, pediatrics,
orthopedics, geriatrics and cardiology.

3807:	It based the rankings on reputation,
mortality rates,  procedures offered, nursing care and other factors.

3808:	No other Tampa Bay-area hospitals made any of the lists, although several
hospitals elsewhere in Florida were honored: Shands at the University of Florida
in Gainesville was ranked 35th in cancer care, compared with 23rd place last
year.

3809:	In the pediatrics category, which was ranked by reputation alone, Jackson
Memorial Hospital at the University of Miami was 21st of 22 hospitals.

Aug. 25--WENATCHEE -- Expect to find excellent communication between patients
and medical staff at Wenatchee Valley Hospital.

3830:	The main criterion was not quality of care, but how well doctors and nurses
communicate with patients, magazine officials said.

3831:	"We are really pleased," said Dr. David Weber, the medical center's chief
executive officer and chairman of the board of directors.

3832:	Of the 58 hospitals ranked in the state, Wenatchee Valley Hospital garnered the
most points for patient services -- with a heavy emphasis on communication
skills -- at 85 out of 100.

3833:	The results were based on patient surveys collected by the federal government's
Hospital Consumer Assessments of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey,
Consumer Reports officials said.

3834:	Not all hospitals were ranked.

3835:	Tracey Kasnic, the hospital's vice president of patient care services, said
Central Washington Hospital offers such services as open heart surgery,
neurosurgery and end-of-life care, which are not offered at Wenatchee Valley
Hospital and which result in a higher intensity of care, which can cause more
stress for patients.

3836:	The survey ranked both hospitals high for doctor and nurse communication with
patients.

3837:	The survey ranked more than 3,200 hospitals in the nation.

3840:	You
turn to a statewide "tier" ranking system that shows the doctors and hospitals
with the best success rates in treating diabetes.

3841:	The system also shows which
providers achieve that outcome at the lowest out-of-pocket cost to you.

3842:	Two health insurance companies -- Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Medica -- will roll out tiered ranking systems
next year that categorize medical providers based on cost and effectiveness.

3843:	The
state of Minnesota earlier implemented a tiered coverage system, the Minnesota
Advantage Health Plan, for 120,000 state employees and dependents.

3844:	And starting
it all, HealthPartners introduced a tiering system a decade ago that intertwined
best medical practices with costs.

3845:	All health-care consumers will benefit if insurers and providers use this new
system to measure not only cost, but value.

3846:	Focusing solely on cost might make
fiscal sense in the near term, but would almost certainly cost employers and
individual consumers more in the long run.

3847:	CHANGE IS NECESSARY

Changes in the health-care industry are imperative.

3848:	Patients, doctors, insurance
companies -- all must take more active roles if Minnesota is to retain its
reputation for high-quality health care.

3849:	The "tier" ranking system, when it
focuses on quality and cost in a format easily accessible and understandable to
patients, is one promising approach.

3850:	The subject arose earlier this month when Blue Cross and Blue Shield came under
fire for one aspect of its proposal to put providers in one of two tiers, with
patients paying more for access to "second tier" doctors and hospitals.

3851:	Doctors
objected to being categorized based on whether or not they were affiliated with
the lower-cost Blue Cross-preferred hospitals.

3852:	Earlier this month, Blue Cross
decided to drop doctors from its rankings, focusing instead on hospitals and
clinics.

3853:	We're glad Blue Cross, as the state's largest health insurer, stepped
back to reconsider its methodology of doctor ranking.

3854:	The financial efficiency
of a hospital is important, but doctors' rankings should be more than a
reflection of a hospital ledger.

3855:	Ultimately doctors, too, will need to make changes if a statewide tier system is
to work.

3856:	HealthPartners, for example, created a model for diabetes treatment
based on best practices recommended by the Institute for Clinic System
Improvement.

3857:	The hospitals and clinics that had the best outcomes -- fewer diabetes-related
amputations or heart disease for example -- received more compensation.

3858:	Those
providers were also graded on cost containment.

3859:	An effective tier system underscores best practices and rewards practitioners
for their use of them.

3860:	CONSUMERS HAVE ROLE, TOO

Keep in mind patients, also, must become better advocates for themselves.

3861:	Most
patients are unaware of the best way to treat a disease, yet medical research
shows certain treatments are highly effective.

3862:	Patients will need to become more
proactive and ask about best medical practices with the same ease today that
they ask about drugs advertised on television.

3863:	While we're pleased to see more and more insurers move to a tier system that
evaluates costs and outcomes, we'd like to see more consistency and agreement on
effective treatment.

3864:	Everyone -- consumers, providers and insurers -- have a role in reshaping the
health care system.

3865:	Health plans must make their information to patients more
transparent.

3866:	Insurers have to establish bonds of trust with medical providers so
accurate information can be freely exchanged.

3867:	And consumers need to ask more
questions and make more demands for the best medical practices.

3868:	The new rankings, released today, recognized the Rochester-based health care
facility for its "breadth of excellence."

3869:	1 in eight of the 12
specialties, while also claiming the top spot for such categories as reputation,
mortality index, patient safety, nurse staffing and Magnet status, patient
services and technology.

3870:	"This basically demonstrates why Mayo has the most trusted name in health care
globally," Noseworthy said.

3871:	"That's why patients come from 140 countries and 50
states."

3872:	Mayo sits atop the rankings thanks to its stellar performance in the individual
specialties that were measured by the magazine.

3873:	U.S. News & World Report has been compiling its list of best hospitals for 27
years, but didn't actually declare an overall No.

3874:	Mayo was ranked as the top health care facility in three different states:
Minnesota, Arizona and Florida.

3875:	While the main Minnesota campus is in the midst
of an ambitious $6 billion, 20-year expansion project dubbed Destination Medical
Center, Noseworthy specifically cited Mayo's Florida campus as a site that's
made major strides in recent years.

3876:	He says Mayo's
top rankings are critical to attracting new patients from across the globe, many
of whom consult the U.S. News & World Report rankings before deciding where to
seek treatment.

3877:	However, the news won't change anything from the initial vision and mission of
the Mayo brothers.

3878:	"We've been the most trusted name in health care for a very long time, according
to market research," Noseworthy said.

Three Ohio children's hospital's are in the top ten overall

June 10--AKRON -- Akron Children's Hospital, with two facilities in Boardman, is
ranked nationally in seven pediatric specialties, according to U.S. News & World
Report's 2014-15 Best Children's Hospitals report.

3903:	Of the 89 ranked hospitals, 10 -- including three in Ohio -- earned a place on
the Honor Roll, according to the magazine report.

3904:	A 372-bed children's general facility with 9,453 admissions in the most recent
year reported, Akron Children's performed 3,316 annual inpatient and 12,025
outpatient surgeries.

3905:	The information used to determine the rankings is provided by the American
Hospital Association, which compiles data on all U.S. hospitals through an
annual survey and from other sources.

3906:	U.S. News says in a release that while relatively few children face
life-threatening or rare conditions or have to go through complicated
operations, some do, and they need expertise that a typical hospital, where
nearly all inpatients are adults, cannot provide.

3907:	Nor do most hospitals
see large numbers of children with wide-ranging cancers or respiratory illnesses
or kidney conditions.

3908:	And even among hospitals that do, the reality, as it is
for hospitals that treat adult patients, is that some places are better than
others.

3909:	That is why U.S. News, in 2007, began using data to rank medical centers on
their ability to help the children who most need it, according to the release.

CAMC set to open floor of building

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

3911:	The Charleston division of West Virginia University's Health Sciences Center
will move some operations into the building's fifth-floor offices and clinics,
and doctors will begin seeing patients Monday, said David Ramsey, CAMC's chief
executive officer.

3912:	"Everybody's pretty excited about it, as a modern medical education facility,"
Ramsey said after the CAMC Board of Trustees met Wednesday.

3913:	The beds have already been placed at the hospital for use in
preparation and post-procedure observation, but need to be licensed by the
Health Care Authority.

3914:	The process could take several weeks, but the cost will
be only for the application fees.

3915:	Though CAMC hospitals admitted about 5 percent fewer patients this June than a
year ago, that doesn't reflect the actual number of beds occupied, said Larry
Hudson, CAMC's chief financial officer.

3916:	When patients stay longer than expected
or need observation without meeting the criteria for admissions, the hospital
can still need more beds.

3917:	The state authority must sign off
on major projects for West Virginia hospitals.

3918:	Hospitals are evaluated every three years by the ACS and receive a ranking of
their ability to provide emergency medical services.

BMC earns honors

Saturday December 18, 2010

PITTSFIELD -- Berkshire Medical Center has been ranked as one of the top
hospitals in the state and in the upper echelon nationally in several categories
in a study conducted by a national organization.

3941:	The independent study by Health- Grades, a health care ratings group, lists the
Pittsfield hospital in the top 10 percent in the nation in both stroke care and
pulmonary care.

3942:	In Massachusetts, BMC was ranked first among hospitals in the treatment of
stroke and critical care services.

3943:	HealthGrades rates 5,000 hospitals nationwide, and institutions cannot choose
not to be rated.

3944:	In the past two years, BMC has hired four new neurologists who have improved
care for the 225 to 250 patients each year who have a stroke or a stroke
warning, according to Gray Ellrodt, the hospital's chief of medicine.

3945:	Critical care services encompass multiple conditions, the most common of which
is sepsis, or overwhelming infection in the bloodstream.

3946:	The hospital has slipped in the rankings in gastrointestinal medical treatment.

3947:	This
year BMC was given a poor, or 1-star, rating gastrointestinal surgeries and
procedures category.

3948:	Kelly said that what drove those numbers down was not the surgeries themselves,
but that patients were developing pressure ulcers afterward.

3949:	BMC has since taken
measures to reduce those complications, she said.

3950:	HealthGrades issues star ratings for 26 procedures and medical treatments:
5-star ratings indicate a mortality or complication rate below the national
average; 3-star means performance is as expected; and 1-star illustrates a
mortality or complication rate higher than the national average.

3952:	Three Manhattan hospitals were among the top 17 medical centers of more than
4,700 in the nation - making New York the only city in the country that can make
such a boast, according to the 2014-15 rankings released Tuesday by U.S. News &
World Report.

3953:	And in the New York metropolitan area, 50 of the 180 area hospitals were
recognized by U.S. News for excellence in one or more specialties as well.

3954:	"This achievement is
made possible by the amazing team of doctors, nurses, and staff at New
York-Presbyterian who are dedicated to providing the highest-quality and most
compassionate care, every day to every patient.

3955:	The 2014-15 rankings were based on the evaluation of 4,743 hospitals in the U.S.
Factors used to compile the rankings include survival rates, safety procedures,
nurse-to-patient ratios, infection control and reputation of specialists.

3956:	Of those, just 144 were nationally ranked in at least one of 16 specialties,
representing just 3% of all the hospitals analyzed.

3957:	"New York-area consumers who have complex, challenging medical needs have access
to some of the nation's best hospitals," said Ben Harder, managing editor and
director of health care analysis for U.S. News.

3958:	"New York is also unique among metro areas in that it has three of the 17
hospitals on the U.S. News Honor Roll this year - including New
York-Presbyterian, NYU Langone Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center,"
Harder added.

3959:	"These three institutions have demonstrated a remarkable depth and
breadth of medical expertise."

3960:	"Every one of
the doctors and staff at Mount Sinai was very thorough and caring toward Kinsey.

3961:	New York- area hospitals also had bragging rights for having at least one of the
nation's top 10 programs in the 16 medical specialties that U.S. News evaluates
- from cardiology and cancer to geriatrics and psychiatry.

3962:	9 in urology, specialties involved in caring
for some cancer patients.

3963:	Even two municipal hospitals - Bellevue and Harlem hospitals - were ranked "high
performing" in one specialty: nephrology.

3964:	"We are delighted and honored to once again be a top hospital for cancer, but
this recognition is really a reflection of an entire community of exceptional
people - our dedicated staff of almost 13,000 and our patients who have placed
their trust in our care," said Memorial Sloan- Kettering CEO Dr. Craig Thompson.

3965:	1 in the national rankings for this year, but our patients are
No.

SPECIAL ANNUAL REPORT;
THE GEORGIA 100;
THE BEST OF BUSINESS;
Software company thrives on change in health systems;
Feeding growth: HBO & Co. wants to link the separate facilities of giant medical
networks with its computer programs.

3975:	It has several elements: hospitals and clinics, health insurance, physician
practices, home health care, pharmacies, long-term care - all connected by
arrows.

3976:	The Atlanta-based company wants to link the separate facilities of giant medical
systems with its financial and clinical software.

3977:	Anything from a patient's
medical history to insurance claims information could be called up, at any site,
with a click of a button.

3978:	Right now, those networks provide just a small piece of HBOC's revenue.

3979:	But as
hospitals and other medical providers are forced to get more efficient, McCall
sees it as a big growth area.

3980:	That would continue to feed a steep growth curve HBOC has built since 1991.

3981:	Last year, HBOC's revenue increased 30 percent and earnings 50 percent.

3982:	2 among providers of information systems and services in health care, bearing
down on No.

3983:	HBOC said it would buy
Charlotte-based Health Systems Group, a unit of First Data, for more than $ 180
million in stock.

3984:	Stock 'reasonably valued'

The company's stock price has followed the growth curve, though it has been
accompanied by a high price-to-earnings ratio.

3985:	And it holds a large share of the market of
hospitals with 500 or more beds - those expected to survive and lead the rush to
consolidation.

3986:	For clients, HBOC's core products can track patient care, along with radiology,
pharmacy and laboratory operations.

3987:	HBOC's financial systems cover billing and
collections, accounting and budgeting.

3988:	Such data help hospitals make decisions on cost and patient care quickly and
accurately.

3989:	HBOC also provides staff to run hospitals' data systems, and sells computer
hardware.

3990:	But last year's revenue spurt came not just from these core products but from
new products and acquisitions.

3991:	Earlier this year, HBOC acquired a company specializing in laboratory
information systems, and struck a deal to buy Pegasus Medical, which has
developed a hand-held, computer-based patient records system, primarily for
doctors' offices.

3992:	In 1991, the year he joined
HBOC from CompuServe, HBOC lost $ 3.4 million on revenue of $ 170.7 million.

3993:	"I think McCall has a very good feel of both computer markets and health care
markets," said Alan Jenks of Jenks Healthcare Business Report, an industry
newsletter.

3994:	Revolution

Another plus for the company is the revolution revamping the payment scheme in
health care.

3995:	Under the old rules, hospitals felt little pressure to be cost- effective.

3996:	The
more medical services performed, the more revenue generated.

3997:	Now, hospitals and other medical providers are being forced to be more efficient
than ever - to improve quality of care and drive costs down, he said.

3998:	First, technology to help hospitals handle managed
care premiums and payments has great potential, he says.

3999:	In addition, many hospitals have consolidated to provide metrowide care systems.

4000:	The push is not just to have access to financial data but to connect medical
providers with clinical information.

4001:	"Once you link up with all providers, you need to communicate electronic medical
records," said analyst Steven Halper of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

4002:	Thus, HBOC's health-network diagram is important to the company's future, Halper
added.

4003:	"There's a certain amount of risk," including possible problems with new
services, or being late to market with a product.

4004:	This story features HBO & Co., a health
care software and information systems company, ranked number 3 among Georgia's
Top 100 businesses.

BYLINE: Aswat Masriya

LENGTH: 388  words


CAIRO, Feb 5 (Aswat Masriya) - Doctors at Matariya Teaching Hospitaldecided
Friday to submit their resignation to the Minister of Health if alleged police
assault on doctors is not investigated.

4020:	The Matariya doctors said they will resume work at the reception and emergency
departments of the hospital despite not having had their "rights" given back to
them, according to a statement published on Friday on the Egyptian Medical
Syndicate wesbsite.

4021:	The doctors at the Matariya hospital have held a week-long strike after low-
ranking policemen reportedly assaulted two doctors at the hospital in January.

4022:	A video published by Egyptian news portal Mobtada late January featured a doctor
who works at the Hospital,detailing the purported assault against him by low-
ranking policemen as he attempted to provide one of them with healthcare.

4023:	The Matariya prosecution ordered the release of the policemen after they
reconciled with the two doctors but a syndicate official said the doctors waived
the complaint after they were subjected to "severe pressures" inside the
Matariya police station.

4024:	The syndicate called on the interior minister to suspend the low-ranking
policemen believed to be involved in the purported assault on two doctor,
statingthat if no legal action is taken against the policemen, "all options to
escalate" are on the table.

4025:	This included holding a partial strike "in order to
preserve the dignity of the masses of doctors."

4026:	An emergency general assembly meeting of the syndicate is due to be held on Feb.
12, to which the health minister and senior ministry officials will be invited.

Packing a healthy punch

BYLINE: Austin Ramsey, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.

4028:	SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 949 words


July 16--The region most served by hospitals in and around Owensboro has been
identified as one of the healthiest in the state by a foundation aimed at
promoting high-performance health.

4029:	Still, statewide health
indicators remain below the national average, and the Owensboro region dropped
several rankings since the last Commonwealth Fund scorecard was released in
2011.

4030:	Hospital referral regions represent regional health care markets with at least
on hospital in which complex surgeries are performed.

4031:	The Commonwealth Fund rankings are divided into four dimensions: access,
prevention and treatment, health lives and avoidable trips to the hospital
(including hospital costs).

4032:	OH officials say the region's dominance is at least partly an indication of its
mission to change the landscape of health care locally.

4033:	It is undertaking major outreach operations in
neighboring cities and counties such as three new multimillion-dollar outpatient
medical facilities in Henderson, Madisonville and Powderly set to open next
year.

4034:	Even though OHRH is the only hospital in its region equipped to handle complex
medical procedures, CEO Greg Strahan, however, said he doesn't believe there is
a lack of competition in the area.

4035:	Improvement in both the region's and state's access to care has also been
attributed to a sharp decline in the number of uninsured Kentuckians under the
2014 Medicaid expansion and creation of the state health insurance marketplace.

4036:	Strahan said he believes state and federal policies like that have created a new
population of patients who are empowered to take control of their health in ways
they never have before.

4037:	"Any time you provide access to care through insurance, you make it more
affordable for people to care for themselves," he said.

4038:	Owensboro fell in other ranking dimensions such as prevention and treatment,
hospital visits and healthy lives, but not as much as other regions including
Lexington, Louisville and Nashville, which serves parts of Kentucky.

4039:	The
Lexington region, which encompasses all of eastern Kentucky, has some of the
poorest health rankings in the nation.

4040:	OH Chief Medical Officer Michael Scherm said many of the medical needs in the
community are linked.

4041:	Access, while improved, can go a long way toward stopping
fast-moving breast and colorectal cancers.

4042:	Much of the data collected in the
nationwide report released this week comes from 2014, but Scherm said OH has
been working diligently before and ever since at proving even more screening
opportunities both at its largest hospital in Owensboro and at clinics and
health centers region-wide.

4043:	"We're pushing for things like primary care services, because it's what stops
these diseases and complications in their tracks."

4044:	Regular care, he added, makes for longer, healthier lives.

4045:	"Our mission is to provide as many health care services at a local level as we
can," said Cecelia Robinson, supervisor of Community Relations.

4046:	"We have to
bring medical services to the people."

4047:	The interconnectivity of health demands is also present in unhealthy habits like
smoking, said Debbie Fillman, Green River District Health Department public
health director.

4048:	Smoking cessation efforts affect the number of cancer patients, low birth
weights and chronic health conditions.

4049:	"We might be the best in the state," she said, "but we're the best in an
unhealthy state.

Rural hospitals at a loss

The mass resignation of doctors and specialists to protest the new
pay-for-performance (P4P) scheme is causing chaos in many rural hospitals.

4052:	According to the P4P scheme, a doctor's salary and additional allowance are
calculated according to the number of patients they see.

4053:	Since the Public Health
Ministry initiated its plan to implement the P4P scheme on April 1, up to 148
doctors have quit rural hospitals.

4054:	Some have moved to state hospitals in town,
private hospitals or beauty clinics.

4055:	He said
the cost of solar-power production was trending down and was now close to the
cost of electricity generation by the country's large independent power plants,
especially those using liquefied natural gas (LNG), imports of which are rising
for use in generating electricity.

.University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics is ranked among the nation's best
hospitals in seven different specialities, according to the 2010 "America's Best
Hospitals" report from U.S. News and World Report.

4076:	The report released on Thursday ranked U.S. hospitals in 16 specialties.

4077:	"As every member of our staff here knows, this hospital puts patient safety and
the quality of care at the center of our efforts," Donna Katen-Bahensky,
president and CEO of UW Hospital and Clinics, said in a news release from the UW
news service.

4078:	The publication ranks the top 50 hospitals in 16 specialties, after reviewing
4,852 hospitals.

4079:	Only 152 of the hospitals scored high enough to be ranked in
any specialty.

4080:	34 in gastroenterology, the UW news release said.

4081:	Results from a recent survey
of Medicare and Medicaid patients show out of seven hospitals in the Western
Washington region (Providence St. Peter Hospital in Olympia, Providence
Centralia Hospital, Good Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup, Capital Medical Center
in Olympia, Tacoma General, St. Joseph Hospital in Tacoma, and St. John in
Longview), Providence Centralia Hospital overall has the highest positive
rankings.

4082:	This data comes from surveys of patients
taken between July 2007 and June 2008.

4083:	Yet when patients were asked if they would recommend Providence Centralia
Hospital to family and friends, Providence Centralia Hospital came in third out
of the seven (although 68 percent said they would forward such a
recommendation).

4084:	Overall it had the highest
cumulative rankings out of all the hospitals.

4085:	The top rankings were in the
categories of: "How often did nurses communicate well with patients," "How often
did patients receive help quickly from hospital staff," and "How often did staff
explain about medicines before giving them to patients."

4086:	We've also heard
glowing reports of great health care.

4087:	The track record: in 2007, Providence Centralia Hospital offered $5 million in
free and discounted medical care for the needy, and another $7 million in
covering unfunded parts of government-sponsored medical care.

4088:	In the mid-1990s
they spent $15 million on an expansion of the hospital.

4089:	And late last year the hospital broke
ground on its $6 million, 17,000-square-foot cancer center.

4090:	It all adds up to a professional, caring and modern health care facility that
serves this community well.

4091:	Just ask the patients that go there.

Cancer Care

LENGTH: 421  words


New Delhi, Sept. 12 -- The Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and
Washington University School of Medicine has been ranked a top 10 cancer center
nationally by U.S. News & World Report.

4107:	6 on the news magazine's 2012 "Best
Hospitals" list, released today.

4108:	"As a national leader in cancer, Siteman offers patients the very best in
clinical care, and we are proud of the unique and innovative research
contributions by our world-class faculty," says Timothy Eberlein, MD, Spencer T.
and Ann W. Olin Distinguished Professor at Washington University and director of
Siteman.

4109:	"We are honored for this recognition of our commitment to the patients
we serve."

4110:	Fewer than 150 of the nation's nearly
5,000 hospitals performed well enough to rank in even one of 16 specialties such
as cancer.

4111:	The methodology U.S. News & World Report uses to rank 12 of 16 specialties is
based on a mathematical model combining reputation, mortality rate, patient
safety and care-related factors such as nursing and patient services.

4112:	This year,
the magazine changed its methodology, emphasizing measures with a direct link to
the quality of patient care compared to more subjective reputation scores.

4113:	The 2012 "Best Hospitals" list is online at www.usnews.com/besthospitals.

4116:	In creating the rankings, staff at MHADegree.org gathered social media stats for
all of the hospitals listed as "Nationally Ranked" for at least one adult
specialty by U.S. News & World Report and used the number of followers and the
amount of activity on each platform to calculate a score.

July 20--A news magazine's ranking of the nation's leading hospitals identifies
Regional Hospital of Scranton as the area's top medical facility.

4120:	The magazine cited the hospital's
high score in patient-safety metrics, reported the facility performed well in
gastroenterology procedures and rated above-average in some patient-satisfaction
categories.

4121:	Scranton Regional succeeded Mercy Hospital in May, when Community Health Systems
Inc., a Nashville-area for-profit corporation, completed a $150 million
acquisition that also included Tyler Memorial Hospital in Tunkhannock and
Special Care Hospital in Nanticoke.

4122:	A University of Scranton health administration professor said Scranton Regional
deserves credit for the recognition, but cautioned against relying too heavily
on any singular report or ranking.

4123:	"We should not put all of our eggs in one quality-rating basket, so to speak,"
said Peter Olden, director of the university's graduate program in health
administration.

4124:	"We ought to not get too focused on any one particular
measurement or report and we ought to look at a wide variety of information and

An annual magazine report on the nation's best research hospitals was published
Monday, with no major surprises, except one.

4135:	The company hired by the magazine to rank the hospitals excluded Emory from
consideration because it didn't fill out an American Hospitals Association
survey, one of the sources of data for the list.

4136:	The magazine itself says the rankings, in fields ranging from AIDS to
geriatrics, are not an indication of a hospital's worthiness, but a tool for
consumers shopping for health care.

4137:	Among Southern research hospitals, Duke University Medical Center at Durham,
N.C., was fourth on the magazine's list of 16 "honor roll" hospitals, behind
Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and Massachusetts General in
Boston.

4138:	Several other Southern hospitals besides Duke ranked in the top 20 in individual
specialities, but didn't make the honor roll.

4139:	The hospital was also ranked twenty-fourth among the top 100 list and
fifth among healthcare groups with one to 99 employees.

4140:	The rankings were announced in Dallas on Oct. 18 at the awards gala, with
several Wamego City Hospital administrators and employees in attendance.

4141:	"We could not have been more proud to have been there to receive these honors on
behalf of our employees," Shannan Flach, CEO of Wamego City Hospital, said.

4142:	The application for the Best Places to Work in Healthcare program consisted of
27 pages, which asked for employee statistics, as well as bonus and incentive
programs, community service initiatives the hospital sponsors and supports, and
what the organization did to promote exercise and fitness.

4143:	One of two open-ended
essays asked employees to describe what makes the hospital a great place to
work.

4144:	The application process also included a 72-question internal Employee
Engagement and Satisfaction Survey.

4145:	In its ranking of twenty-fourth among the top 100 Best Places to Work in
Healthcare, the hospital was measured against health care organizations from all
over the country and from the smallest with 25 employees to the largest with
over 12,000 employees.

4146:	Wamego City Hospital has 75 employees.

4147:	"Being named one of the best places to work in healthcare in the nation was an
incredible honor, but to be named the Best Small Hospital is a real indication
that our employees are among the most passionate providers of excellent, high
quality health care in the country," Flach said.

4148:	Modern Healthcare is a highly recognized and respected magazine in the health
care industry, with a circulation of over 70,000.

4149:	The Best Places to Work in
Healthcare program is sponsored by The Studer Group and the What's Right in
Health Care Conference and is intended to recognize outstanding employers in the
health care industry on a national level.

4150:	"Our healthcare team enjoys coming to work every day and serving the community
to the best of their ability, and for them to be recognized for that on a
national level, means that we are continuing the high level of service to this
community for which Wamego City Hospital has been known for nearly 100 years,"
Flach said.

4151:	An unauthorized person gained access to information about 2,036 UW
Hospital patients in March, a spokeswoman said Thursday.

4152:	While the breach didn't include patients' Social Security numbers, health
insurance information or other financial information, it did include files on
patient names, addresses, dates of care, reasons for visits, medical history and
conditions, medications, diagnostic results and/or social history, among others.

4153:	The person accessed the information through an employee's email.

4154:	Once
discovered, UW Hospital started an investigation, disabled the employee's email
and reset the password, Brunette said.

4155:	UW Hospital is sending letters to a group of patients about the incident and has
set up a call center to answer patient questions, she said.

4156:	Woman leaps into action, foils thief

MILWAUKEE ?

4157:	The story will run in the August edition of the magazine but is already
available online at www.usnews.com/besthospitals .

4158:	The magazine will be on
newsstands on July 27, according to the website.

4159:	According to the website, U.S. News evaluated a total of more than 5,000
hospitals nationally, in 16 different adult categories, including psychiatry.

4160:	These numbers included death rates,
procedure, volume and nurse-patient ratio.

4161:	The outstanding factor in the report, according to Chauncey Collins, director of
operations and finance at Riggs, is that Riggs is by far the smallest facility
on the list, with 74 beds and a total of 79 patients.

4162:	Most of the rest of the top
10 are hospitals with hundreds of beds and greater resources, he said.

4163:	"We are a tiny hospital, a $17 million operation, compared to facilities like
Duke, Yale and Mass.

4164:	"[The high ranking] shows that what we offer our patients, what we do here, we
do it well," said Lewis.

4165:	Another of the strengths of Riggs, said Lewis, is the longer term programs,
which allow patients to slow their treatment down, and give them time to
improve.

4166:	Most psychiatric hospitals treat patients for days.

4167:	This latest ranking comes on the heels of a $20 million expansion and renovation
program at Austen Riggs that is ongoing, said Collins.

4168:	There are still some ongoing projects, said Collins, which will
admittedly depend on how much money is raised to cover their costs.

They are medical centers that serve some of the youngest and most fragile of
patients, ranging from tiny premature babies to teens suffering from
debilitating diseases.

4171:	Nine New York area hospitals placed in the top 50 in the country in at least one
medical specialty, according to annual rankings released Tuesday by U.S News &
World Report.

4172:	"We know how desperate parents are for information when their child is in the
middle of a major medical crisis and decisions have to be made fast," said Avery
Comarow, health rankings editor at U.S News & World Report.

4173:	The magazine's researchers evaluated 183 children's hospitals across the nation
and determined how they ranked among 10 specialties that include cancer,
neonatology, cardiology and heart surgery.

4174:	The rigorous analysis was based on data from the hospitals as well as a survey
of pediatric specialists.

4175:	"It says something about a real commitment to care that more than 100 children's
hospitals voluntarily completed our clinical survey," Comarow said.

4176:	We've been told it costs a hospital tens of thousands of
dollars in staff time."

4177:	Three local hospitals made the top 50 rankings in seven categories: the Steven
and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, L.I.

4178:	Other New York metropolitan area hospitals that ranked in
the top 50 in at least one category included Maria Fareri Children's Hospital in
Westchester County; Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, L.I.

4179:	Analysts also put together an annual Honor Roll for hospitals with exceptionally

SARASOTA

Sarasota Memorial Hospital has been named among the best health care centers in
the nation for the treatment of seniors, the third consecutive year it has
received the superlative ranking.

4183:	U.S. News & World Report's annual "best hospitals" ranking, in its 20th year and
considered one of the top measurements of care in 16 various specialties, listed
Sarasota Memorial as 37th on a list of 50 for geriatric care.

4184:	More than half of the roughly 103,000 patients Sarasota Memorial treats annually
are 65 or older, hospital data shows.

4185:	"Sarasota Memorial has put together an extraordinary group of physicians and
taken numerous steps in quality improvements, steps that are ahead of the
nation," said Dr. Bruce Robinson, a board certified geriatrician and medical
director of the hospital's geriatric services.

4186:	The magazine considered reputation; a hospital's ability to keep patients alive;
how well it minimized harm to patients; and nurse staffing, technology and other
patient care-related information in compiling its rankings.

4187:	Sarasota Memorial is one of six Florida hospitals recognized for geriatric care.

4188:	Robinson said Sarasota Memorial's electronic record-keeping, focus on patient
safety and medical library, in particular, make the hospital stand out when
treating seniors.

4189:	Sarasota Memorial also maintains a memory disorder center for the treatment of
Alzheimer's Disease, and is among only 5 percent of U.S. hospitals designated by
an American Nurses Association group as a "magnet" hospital for nursing
excellence.

4190:	In all, the magazine and North Carolina-based research firm RTI International
analyzed 4,861 hospitals nationwide and determined just 174 met criteria to be
on their list.

4191:	As the largest shareholder of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services Plc (BGH), the
operator of Bangkok, Samitivej, BNH and Phyathai hospitals, Dr Prasert had a
20.19% stake worth 57.87 billion baht.

4192:	His holdings calculated in the ranking did not include that in Bangkok Airways
Plc (BA), which debuted on the SET after the ranking was compiled.

Expert: Hospital ratings need 'scrutiny' after LGH gets vastly different
rankings

BYLINE: By Grant Welker, gwelker@lowellsun.com

SECTION: TODAY'S HEADLINES

LENGTH: 975 words


Someone looking to gauge how well local hospitals keep patients safe are
confronted with a dizzying array of methods that groups use: letter grades,
numbers, stars, check marks, percentages and colors.

4201:	In few cases do hospitals
receive an overall easy-to-comprehend score.

4202:	Lowell General Hospital recently earned a "C" for its Varnum Avenue campus, its
lowest score in several years issued by the nonprofit health-care advocate The
Leapfrog Group.

4203:	The Leapfrog ratings are just one of several that offer a look at patient safety
at each hospital, each using a different way of showing how well hospitals do.

4204:	PatientCareLink compares Lowell General Hospital to peer hospitals in nearly 50
areas, as well as hospitals nationally and statewide in another dozen
categories.

4205:	The two hospitals performed best in the surgery safety categories, each landing
above average in such areas as the use of antibiotics and blood-clot prevention.

4206:	Medicare.gov , an official federal government rating service, showed Lowell
General at three stars out of five in a patient survey.

4207:	In dozens of other areas, the hospital was reviewed by Medicare.gov as the
percentage of patients who answered in the affirmative to care in a number of
categories.

4208:	"The data can be sliced and diced many different ways," said Donovan, whose
staff includes about 20 workers who focus on patient safety.

4209:	Dr. Deeb Salem, the physician-in-chief and chairman of Tufts Medical Center's
Department of Medicine, co-authored with two colleagues a study over the spring
in the Journal of General Internal Medicine that found that hospital rankings
"may be inadequate, inaccurate or even potentially harmful to patients."

4210:	The authors, both with the U.S. News & World Report, said reviewing services
"must make numerous trade-offs" in creating methods for data.

4211:	The publication
plans to refine its reporting methods, they said.

4212:	"Quality measurement is an immature science," the authors said.

4213:	Still, he added, hospitals do pay attention to the external reviews out of
concern for their reputations.

4214:	Leapfrog's ratings are established enough to be linked to by a state health
website.

4215:	This time, it fell to a C, landing
in the lowest 15 percent of Massachusetts hospitals that were studied.

4216:	The campus, which offers the same services
as the main campus except for maternity, earned a B this spring.

4217:	Breakout

Massachusetts hospitals fared well in the latest Leapfrog ratings.

4218:	Of 62
hospitals ranked in the state, 32 earned an A. Twenty received a B, and 10 got a
C.

Nationwide, three-fifths of hospitals earned an A or a B.

4221:	Moffitt employees can be proud of the ranking, which also reflects favorably on
the USF College of Medicine, he said.

4222:	Rankings are based on such things as reputation, reflecting the percentage of
doctors naming a hospital in three annual surveys; mortality rate, actual
compared with expected deaths; and other factors such as the ratio of registered
nurses to hospital beds, the magazine said.

Medicare penalizes 3 Valley hospitals

Three hospitals in the Lehigh Valley are taking a financial hit for being among
facilities nationwide with infection and complication rates that the federal
government considers high.

4245:	The ranking means that Medicare is reducing payments to those
hospitals by 1 percent for one year - a period that began in October.

4246:	This year 769 of 3,203 hospitals reviewed were penalized, up from 751 last year,
according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

4247:	St. Luke's University Health Network's Miners campus in Schuylkill County,
Geisinger Medical Center in Montour County and the University of Pennsylvania
and Thomas Jefferson University hospitals in Philadelphia also are among the 40
facilities in Pennsylvania facing cuts.

4248:	The report, released in December, is part of the Affordable Care Act's Hospital
-Acquired Condition Reduction Program, which seeks to get hospitals to stem
preventable conditions such as surgical-site infections, post-operative hip
fractures, sepsis and accidental lacerations.

4249:	The
biggest reductions were for bad reactions to medicines, catheter infections and
post-surgical blood clots.

4250:	For Lehigh Valley Health Network's Cedar Crest campus, the penalty will result
in a loss of more than $1 million, said Dr. Anthony Ardire, LVHN senior vice
president for quality and patient safety.

4251:	This is the third year the hospital is
in the bottom quartile, according to data from Kaiser Health News that looked
at which hospitals were on the list in past years.

4252:	Ardire lauded efforts to make hospitals safer.

4253:	Smaller community hospitals,
he said, tend to have healthier patients who get released faster, reducing the
chance for hospital-acquired conditions.

4254:	"It penalizes hospitals with the sickest patients that get all the referrals,
with the regional burn centers and the regional trauma centers," Ardire said.

U.S. News ranking could draw more patients to Mayo Clinic

BYLINE: Jeff Hansel, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

4256:	1 hospital ranking by U.S. News & World Report might
have economic implications for Rochester.

4257:	But the rest visit for medical
reasons.

4258:	3 hospitals, Massachusetts General in Boston and Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore, are located in large cities that might not even notice an
uptick in visitors related to health care.

4259:	Sara Hismoto, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore Convention and Visitors Bureau,
said Baltimore has "not done any research on the U.S. News and World Report
rankings and how it relates to economic impact."

4260:	"At this time, we only track visitation in general terms -- overall visitors
broken down into leisure and business -- we haven't breached the medical tourism
category to get into any specifics in that arena," she said.

4261:	He said the U.S. News rankings include measures of reputation, patient volume,
services and quality of care.

4262:	1 ranking affect Rochester's standing related to the $6 billion
Destination Medical Center effort?Noseworthy said it will, but he emphasized
that DMC is broader than Mayo Clinic.

4263:	"Mayo Clinic has the largest percentage of patients who travel to get that
care," he said.

4264:	"It'll bring more patients to Mayo Clinic, and that's a good
thing, in my opinion."

4265:	He surmised Mayo's continued focus on hospital mortality rates and infection
rates might have had an impact and pointed to Mayo employees as the reason for
improvement.

4266:	About 30 percent to 40 percent of patients in general will look at
rankings when deciding upon a medical center.

4267:	When patients are seeking a
specialist in, say, neurosurgery (Mayo is ranked No.

4268:	It's always going to be a race for No.

4269:	But any time a medical
center is in the top three or four (Mayo ranks there in 11 out of 12
specialties), patients will have confidence.

4270:	DMC, Jones said, is not limited by health expertise -- because it's always been
clear Mayo has that expertise available.

4271:	Rather, DMC will depend upon adding
community amenities to support the availability of that medical expertise.

4272:	It's a great time to be in health care.

4273:	"I think there's a little bit of a spring in our step today," Noseworthy said.

published by GoLocalProv.

that took part in Leap Frog's annual review.

4284:	There are about 5,800 registered
U.S. hospitals, according to the American Hospital Association.

4285:	Kaiser's Marin membership has grown in recent years as it has expanded its
services and attracted local physicians into its ranks.

4286:	Leap Frog's review is available at www.leapfroggroup.org ; the group's name
illustrates its goal to encourage great leaps forward in quality of care and
safety for patients.

4287:	The honor was announced the same week as Kaiser's plans to expand its Terra
Linda medical campus, including adding much-needed parking made the front page.

4288:	Kaiser's growth is illustrated most days as vehicles overflow the hospital's
parking lot and garage and line Montecello Road, often stretching onto nearby
neighborhood streets.

4289:	Kaiser set up shop in Terra Linda in the early 1960s and has grown to where
about 50 percent of Marin's insured households are Kaiser patients.

4290:	Kaiser's plan to build a new garage with 290 more parking spaces should be
welcome news for neighbors and Kaiser's patients.

4291:	Solving its parking problem will score more points
with patients and neighbors.

Many yardsticks for hospital grades

BYLINE: By Grant Welker, gwelker@lowellsun.com

Someone looking to gauge how well local hospitals keep patients safe are
confronted with a dizzying array of methods that groups use: letter grades,
numbers, stars,

check marks, percentages and colors.

4293:	In few cases do hospitals receive an
overall easy-to-comprehend score.

4294:	HealthAlliance Hospital in Leominster earned a C, its third straight semiannual
period with that score, after otherwise recording A's and B's from the nonprofit
health-care advocate The Leapfrog Group.

4295:	The Leapfrog ratings are just one of several reviews that give patients a look
at patient safety at each hospital, each using a different way of showing how
well hospitals do.

4296:	HealthAlliance, part of UMass Memorial Health Care, ranked as the safest in
Massachusetts for consecutive years by Consumer Reports, said Dr. Dan O'Leary,
the hospital's chief medical officer, "but in those two years, we weren't ranked
high by Leapfrog."

4297:	PatientCareLink compares HealthAlliance Hospital to peer hospitals in nearly 50
areas, as well as hospitals nationally and statewide in another dozen
categories.

4298:	Medicare.gov , an official federal government rating service, showed
HealthAlliance at three stars out of five in a patient survey.

4299:	In dozens of other areas, the hospital was reviewed by Medicare.gov as the
percentage of patients who answered in the affirmative to care in a number of
categories.

4300:	Many others in health care have reservations or worse about outside reviews.

4301:	Dr. Deeb Salem, the physician-in-chief and chairman of Tufts Medical Center's
department of medicine, co-authored with two colleagues a study this spring in
the Journal of General Internal Medicine that found that hospital rankings "may
be inadequate, inaccurate or even potentially harmful to patients."

4302:	The authors, both with the U.S. News & World Report, said reviewing services
"must make numerous trade-offs" in creating methods for data.

4303:	The publication
plans to refine its reporting methods, they said.

4304:	"Quality measurement is an immature science," the authors said.

4305:	Still, he
added, hospitals do pay attention to the external reviews out of concern for
their reputation.

4306:	hospital ratings

Massachusetts hospitals fared well in the latest Leapfrog ratings.

4307:	Of 62
hospitals ranked in the state, 32 earned an A. Twenty received a B, and 10 got a
C.

Nationwide, three-fifths of hospitals earned an A or a B.

EvergreenHealth recognized among best hospitals in the nation by Healthgrades

BYLINE: The Woodinville Weekly staff

LENGTH: 446  words


EvergreenHealth recently announced it has earned several distinctions for 2014
across many of the health care system's specialties from Healthgrades, the
nation's leading independent provider of information to help consumers make
informed decisions about a physician or hospital.

4310:	This places EvergreenHealth among the top 5 percent of hospitals in the nation
for clinical excellence in each of those specialties.

4311:	To determine the rankings, Healthgrades evaluated nearly 4,500 hospitals
nationwide for 31 of the most common inpatient procedures and conditions and
identified the 100 best hospitals within each procedure.

4312:	"Delivering the highest level of quality care and service to our patients and
their families is at the very heart of everything we do," said EvergreenHealth
CEO Robert Malte.

4313:	"Recognitions like this underscore that commitment to our
community, and it's the hard work of each physician, provider, nurse, staff
person and volunteer that helps us achieve excellence in these and many other
specialties and practices across the organization."

4314:	In addition, EvergreenHealth is also among the top 10 percent of hospitals in
the nation for the treatment of stroke for the fifth consecutive year.

4315:	A 5-star rating indicates the hospital
consistently helps patients achieve better-than-expected outcomes.

4316:	Other 2014 5-star rankings, which place EvergreenHealth in the top 15 percent of
hospitals in the nation, include recognition for treatment of heart failure,
pneumonia and sepsis; and for gastrointestinal care such as treatment of GI
bleed and pancreatitis and for both colorectal surgery and appendectomy
procedures.

4317:	According to Healthgrades, if all hospitals had performed similarly from 2010 to
2012 to hospitals receiving 5 stars, on average 234,252 lives could potentially
have been saved and 157,418 complications could potentially have been avoided.

Tuen Mun Hospital worst in surgery;
Improvements demanded as ratio of unexpected deaths after operations worsens
after the facility demonstrated headway in the previous year

BYLINE: Elizabeth Cheung

Tuen Mun Hospital ranked worst among all public hospitals for the sixth time in
surgical performances, with the highest ratio of unexpected deaths after
surgery.

4333:	In the Hospital Authority's latest report on surgical performances, the hospital
in Tuen Mun had the highest ratio of fatalities for scheduled operations at
2.202 - meaning the actual number of deaths was a little more than double the
number of patients expected to die after surgery.

4334:	Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung performed the worst in emergency
operations, with a fatality ratio of 1.48.

4335:	Of the 13 hospitals doing emergency operations, Ruttonjee Hospital was
considered the best with a fatality ratio of 0.298.

4336:	For scheduled operations,
there were 17 hospitals ranked in the survey, of which Tuen Mun was the worst.

4337:	"The report was not a ranking, but just [a way] to evaluate the performance of
individual hospitals and look for improvement for less satisfactory hospitals,"
said Professor Paul Lai Bo-san, director of the authority's surgical outcomes
monitoring and improvement programme.

4338:	The report, which recorded around 25,000 surgeries between July 1, 2014 and June
30 last year, measured surgical performance by a ratio of actual fatalities over
expected number of deaths.

4339:	Lai said no reasons were found by data analysis to explain the two hospitals'
poor performances.

4340:	However, he believed taking in extra patients for vascular surgeries could
explain the problem at Princess Margaret Hospital.

4341:	Lai said that in the past two years some patients who were originally scheduled
at other hospitals within the Kowloon West cluster were transferred to Princess
Margaret Hospital.

4342:	"Our targeted measures were once effective," said Lai.

4343:	To meet growing demand in New Territories West, Pok Oi Hospital in Yuen Long
would add 15 sessions of operations each week this year.

4344:	Tsang Kin-ping, vice-chairman of Hong Kong Patients' Voices, said the authority
should take more aggressive action to improve performance at Tuen Mun.

4345:	"If the low ranking were to repeat, not only
services but staff morale would be affected too."

4346:	4 for the percentage of
minorities employed.

4347:	"Our employees and physicians make it possible to be
honored as one of the best companies to work for in America for nine consecutive
years," said Marc Boom, M.D., president and CEO of Houston Methodist.

4348:	"Houston
Methodist is a great place to work because of our employees' complete and
selfless dedication to our patients and to our values."

4349:	Houston Methodist, which includes a flagship teaching hospital, four community
hospitals and a top-ranked research institute, was awarded the ranking for
providing an exemplary workplace for employees.

4350:	Houston Methodist was selected based primarily on a confidential survey sent to
randomly selected employees, who were asked questions on the level of trust,
pride and camaraderie within their workplace.

4351:	Houston Methodist also submitted documentation about its work environment, from
benefits to corporate policies to employee demographics.

4352:	Houston Methodist
offers competitive benefits, diversity in the workforce, recognition for
employees and a unique environment focused on integrity, compassion,
accountability, respect and excellence.

4353:	Houston Methodist Hospital is consistently ranked by U.S. News & World Report as
one of America's best hospitals, ranking in 12 of 16 adult specialties for 2013,
the most in the state.

Hospitals taking notice of BIW's rankings;
The company aims to improve quality of care and reduce costs for its 16,000
workers and dependents.

LENGTH: 1451 words



During the next few weeks, about 16,000 Bath Iron Works employees and their
dependents will get a report card from the company ranking local hospitals on
subjects ranging from in-patient costs to infection control.

4356:	BIW officials said this is the second year they have put out such a ranking, and
they hope it will help their workers and dependents become savvy health-care
consumers.

4357:	They also hope it pushes hospitals to improve to better serve their
workers.

4358:	In a bottom-line way, having employees healthy and working rather than living
through an extended hospital stay due to medical errors makes good business
sense.

4359:	What I've
been most encouraged by is the hospitals' behavior."

4360:	Leveraging a 16,000-strong population of health consumers ensures that southern
Maine hospitals have to pay attention.

4361:	"It clearly has the potential of changing referral patterns almost overnight,"
said Dr. George L. Higgins III, chief medical officer and vice president for
medical affairs at Maine Medical Center in Portland.

4362:	Hospital officials said they support the idea of educating consumers about their
health-care choices, but the officials also noted that a static report card has
limitations.

4363:	In some cases, the data - which BIW took from independent state and national
groups that specialize in examining hospitals - tell only part of the story.

4364:	"It is very early in the evolution of how to present this and what it means,"
said Dr. Stephen Sears, chief medical officer at MaineGeneral Medical Center,
which has hospitals in Augusta and Waterville.

4365:	The concept of transparency in hospitals is a hot topic in the industry, said
Higgins.

4366:	Consumers want to be better informed about their hospitals before they
go in for non-emergency care.

4367:	That information can be particularly helpful in an
area like southern Maine, where consumers have a number of hospitals to choose
from that are geographically convenient.

4368:	As in almost every business, health care is one of the single most significant
costs for BIW.

4369:	"I was convinced early on that the kind of saber rattling around premium costs
really wasn't the issue," Gildart said.

4370:	"You have to get past the insurance
piece of it and start paying attention to what's really going on in the
health-care arena and look at the behavior of all the parties."

4371:	"If you can improve quality,
other things start to fall in place, like cost, etc."

4372:	BIW officials began meeting with hospital executives several years ago to
discuss expectations - what a major employer wants from a health-care provider.

4373:	On the report card, the company also points to other reasons why it undertook
the project:

A 1999 study from the Institute of Medicine estimated that each year up to
98,000 people nationwide die from preventable medical errors in hospitals.

4374:	In 2004, Maine hospitals reported 15 deaths due to medical errors.

4375:	It's logical that BIW should have expectations of hospitals, said Higgins.

4376:	The
company expects its employees to take part in wellness programs, quit smoking
and do other things to improve their health, he noted, and expects hospitals to
provide great care by physicians with cutting-edge skills.

4377:	BIW's report card ranked eight hospitals.

4378:	Gildart suggested that the overall rankings
of the hospital didn't matter much; some hospitals received lower ratings in
certain areas because they choose to specialize in niche services and not in
areas that the rating groups place more importance on.

4379:	Information on the card from the Maine Hospital Association ranks patient
satisfaction surveys and evaluates treatment patients got for heart attacks and
heart failures, said Sears.

4380:	That information, which is outcome-based, is a valid
measurement, he said.

4381:	Less valid, in his opinion, are rankings from the Maine Health Management
Coalition because it evaluated processes (not outcomes), and information was
collected through hospital surveys and was not validated.

4382:	The MHA looks at seven elements, and one of them has to do with having
an effective smoking cessation counseling program for patients.

4383:	But the
reason the hospital does less is because it has some very expert
gastroenterologists who have perfected procedures that eliminate the need for
the surgeries, he said.

4384:	Higgins said Maine Med will have to further develop its on-line connectivity
with its potential patients.

4385:	As consumers consider the hospital for a procedure,
the Web site can have full information about the staff, the operation,
statistics, and other data.

4386:	Gildart said the card wasn't meant to be an "infallible measurement."

4387:	Also, he
said, it is likely to change over time as more information becomes available,
and as hospitals and ranking organizations have further dialogue regarding
what's fair and important information to study.

4388:	Lesko said measuring the monetary benefit of an initiative like this is
impossible, because predicting the cost of health care from one year to the next
is equally challenging.

4389:	But a program like this could show benefits 10 years down the road as overall
health-care quality in Maine rises, helping not only BIW's work force, but the
entire state.

4390:	It is intended to help the company's employees
and dependents make informed decisions about where to obtain the best health
care in southern Maine.

4391:	"These report cards are
making us do the hard work in making sure that we're delivering on what they
want," said Dr. George L. Higgins III, chief medical officer and vice president

Officials at Oklahoma's two medical schools are moving forward with a plan they
hope will combat a shortage of doctors in rural Oklahoma.

4432:	The Oklahoma Hospital Residency Training Program Act provides just over $3
million to create residency programs at hospitals in rural, underserved areas
across the state.

4433:	Under the program, the Oklahoma Health Care Authority would contract with the
Oklahoma State University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Tulsa and the
University of Oklahoma College of Medicine in Oklahoma City to establish and run
new residency programs in medically underserved areas.

4434:	Although those details are still being worked out, Howard Barnett, president of
OSU-Tulsa and the OSU Center for Health Sciences said the university is already
in discussions with a few rural hospitals that are interested in participating
in the program.

4435:	Barnett said he wouldn't name the hospitals that have expressed interest until
those discussions are finalized, but he said most of them are located in towns
with populations of about 25,000.

4436:	Under those programs, students could be granted
conditional admission to medical school as college sophomores, provided they
maintain certain standards.

4437:	Recruiting students who come from rural areas originally is important, she said,
since they tend to be more inclined to return to rural Oklahoma to practice once
they graduate.

4438:	The rankings cite a high prevalence of smoking and obesity, limited availability
of primary care doctors and low use of prenatal care for the low ranking.

4439:	A New England Journal of Medicine article ranks Oklahoma as the state that faces
the most challenges in meeting medical needs.

4440:	According to the article, Oklahoma is expected to see a large expansion in the
Medicaid population as the federal health care law takes effect.

4441:	But Oklahoma
doesn't have the primary care capacity to deal with those newly insured
patients.

4442:	Without outside efforts, the demand for medical care could outstrip
the supply of providers in the state.

4443:	Davis, a former rural hospital administrator, said hospitals in rural areas face
certain challenges that their urban counterparts don't see.

4444:	Doctors in rural
hospitals face tougher call schedules, simply because their staffs are smaller.

4445:	Doctors' spouses may also face limited employment opportunities in rural areas,
she said.

4446:	All those factors make it more difficult for hospitals in rural areas to attract
doctors, she said.

4447:	As a result, rural Oklahoma sees its physician population
shrinking, even as graduates from its medical schools leave the state for their
residencies.

4448:	By exposing students to rural Oklahoma during medical school and bringing them
to rural hospitals for residencies, Davis said, the program will help make them
more aware of the opportunities there.

4449:	That could mean the difference between
sending doctors to rural Oklahoma or to other states.

4450:	"We've already spent a lot of money educating these people.

Bill may curb private healthcare

Hospitals could be coming to the end of their strong run

ADELE SHEVEL

THE big three private hospital groups, accused by the government of making
"super profits", are again highly ranked in the Top 100 Companies.

4461:	But hospitals may be coming to the end of their strong run, given the regulatory
pressure that could reduce their huge earnings.

4462:	The National Health Bill, which has been signed by President Thabo Mbeki, is
aimed at regulating the services of private healthcare.

4463:	This includes the issuing of "certificates of need", which will require doctors
and healthcare facilities such as private hospitals to apply for permission to
practise in a specific area.

4464:	Hospitals are particularly vulnerable because of
the high levels of investment required to set up and run their operations.

4465:	Pressure is also coming from medical schemes and their administrators, which are
looking at ways to counter the power of private hospital groups.

4466:	The Council for Medical Schemes, the body that regulates medical schemes, says
the private hospital market is highly concentrated.

4467:	The council's view is that medical schemes need to offer a consistent set of
benefits to members.

4468:	The hospitals have the power to put forward increases which medical schemes
don't have the power to counter.

4469:	If schemes refuse to accommodate the demands of
hospitals, the hospitals have the power to make members pay out-of-pocket.

4470:	This
leaves members irate with the medical schemes.

4471:	*Government intervention in private healthcare is gaining momentum.

4472:	Legislation
was passed recently to make drugs more affordable and promote the use of generic
equivalents.

4473:	The medical-schemes industry is more regulated to prevent it from
discriminating against "high-risk " individuals - the aged and the sick.

Revealing hospital mortality rankings: Will it lead to better health care?

4475:	In my opinion, the medical system
keeps the patients in the dark about the simplest things like it is a holy inner
sanctum and the peasants are not worthy of the information.

4476:	Carol Edger-Magill, Georgetown

It is unfair to look at a hospital without looking at the health stats for the
area it serves (which may have quite different demographics than other areas/
hospitals - and health stats generally are different for different demographic
groups).

4477:	In addition, some hospitals specialize in "higher-risk" traumas and
some do not even have emergency services.

4478:	Publishing stats comparatively for all
hospitals, without categorizing the hospitals into sub-groups, can lead to
unwarranted public concern and actually cause people to try to avoid certain
hospitals.

4479:	Bob Brewer, Oakville

With this kind of publicly available information, hospitals now have no choice
but to enact new policies and practices so that the next time the rankings are
revealed, they will be seen in a better light.

4480:	Will this also lead to more
people avoiding lower-ranked hospitals?

4481:	I hope that it will not place a burden
on those hospitals that did well.

4482:	Sandra Brawley, Toronto

Publishing mortality ratings of hospitals will make the public more aware that
our health-care system is not infallible.

4483:	This might empower people to ask
questions of their health-care providers.

4484:	Deborah Kennedy, Innisfil

While I applaud the government for making the mortality rates in the various
hospitals more transparent, there are two cautions here: (1) Not all hospitals
are the same.

4485:	Sunnybrook hospital, for example, is a level 3 trauma hospital,
and many badly injured patients do not survive.

4486:	Trauma hospitals will have a
higher mortality rate than other hospitals of similar size.

4487:	Susan Cain, Brampton

Hospitals rated as not so good, are all local hospitals.

4488:	I think looking into
the populations that use these hospitals might be a fairer approach.

4489:	Do the
measurements take into account the average ages of patients within a year at a
particular hospital?

4490:	I think some hospitals might be
stigmatized, without all pertinent statistics being revealed: like the
demographics of a community.

Ontario eyes name/shame hospital ranking; Similar scheme has been used in
Britain, but not without difficulties

BYLINE: Pauline Tam, Postmedia News, With A File From Andrea Woo, Vancouver Sun

The Ontario government is considering a provincewide ranking system for
hospitals that would provide information that would allow patients to compare
hospitals, reward hospitals for good performance and identify poor performers.

4493:	The "name-and-shame" scheme, designed to give patients a clearer picture of
service quality, would be modelled after a short-lived one in Britain, which was
shown to have improved hospital standards, according to documents obtained by
the Ottawa Citizen.

4494:	No such scheme is under consideration in B.C., according to Ministry of Health
spokeswoman Michelle Stewart.

4495:	Under the proposed Ontario system, hospitals would be given a rating of up to
three stars for their performance in areas such as treating patients safely and
effectively, reducing surgical and emergencyroom waits and improving
cleanliness.

4496:	Another system under consideration would simply rate hospitals "excellent,"
"good," "fair" or "weak," according to documents released under
freedomof-information laws.

4497:	However, it's not clear if the
government has adopted the idea.

4498:	In recent years, Ontario hospitals have gradually adopted ways of measuring
their own quality and making their leaders responsible for improving patient
care.

4499:	Last month, new rules kicked in that linked a portion of executive pay to
how well hospitals took care of patients.

4500:	The new rules require the province's 154 hospitals to publicly post annual
reports detailing their progress in meeting a long list of "quality indicators,"
ranging from getting more staff to wash their hands when dealing with patients
to reducing rates of inhospital infections.

4501:	The Ontario government sees the new accountability rules as a way not only to
improve care and rein in executive salaries, but also to provide taxpayers with
a standardized way to compare hospitals and the care they deliver.

4502:	A ranking system would appear to be the next logical step.

4503:	It could also lay the groundwork for more sweeping changes to how hospitals are
funded, with the goal of rewarding those that are more efficient and treat
patients safely and effectively.

4504:	After Britain introduced a star-rating system in 2001, hospitals showed a
noticeable improvement in how well they cared for patients.

4505:	High-performing hospitals were rewarded with more funding and financial freedom
from the government, allowing them the right to borrow money and organize
services to meet local needs.

4506:	At facilities with few or no stars, corporate decisions were scrutinized more
closely, and executives were told they could lose their jobs if they didn't do
better.

4507:	A major downside was that the star-rating system did not take into account the
key measure of whether a hospital's finances were being managed well.

4508:	As a result, the system encouraged low-performing hospitals to spend their way
out of trouble, resulting in massive deficits.

4509:	The reports released to the Ottawa Citizen also indicated that some British
hospitals manipulated their data to look like they had improved standards when
they actually hadn't.

4510:	For example, to meet the target of a maximum four-hour wait for treatment in
emergency departments, some hospitals made patients wait in ambulances outside
the hospital until staff were confident they could be treated.

4511:	The reports concluded that services excluded from the ranking system tended to
be neglected by hospitals.

4512:	As a result, "a low rating in itself will not necessarily encourage
organizations to improve on areas where improvement may be needed if there is no
measurement in place for those areas."

4513:	In 2005, amid political and union opposition to the starrating system, the
British government scrapped the scheme in favour of a two-tiered system that
measured quality of patient care and use of resources.

4514:	Instead of stars, hospitals were given a rating on a fourpoint scale ranging
from excellent to weak.

Aug. 08--TRAVERSE CITY -- The most recent issue of Consumer Reports gave Munson
Medical Center its lowest rating for surgery, based on the percentage of people
who died in the hospital or stayed longer than expected for a given procedure.

4541:	Only four hospitals of 29 in Michigan earned the magazine's "worst" rating.

4542:	But there are two sides to the coin,
said David McGreaham, a physician and Munson's vice president of medical
affairs.

4543:	Consumers Report also used patient mortality as a measure.

4544:	Consumers Report based its ranking on billing claims submitted to Medicare from
2009 to 2011 for patients 65 and older for 27 types of surgeries.

4545:	It received top scores for pain control and patient communication
with nurses and doctors.

4546:	McGreaham said Munson closely tracks medical databases and tries to learn from
them.

4547:	This is Consumers Reports' first effort to compare how surgical patients fare in
2,400 U.S. hospitals.

4548:	"We know the ratings aren't a perfect measurement but we think they're an
important first step in giving patients the information they need to make an
informed choice," said John Santa, medical director of Consumer Reports Health.

4549:	McGreaham agreed with Consumers Report that patients would be wise to research
their medical options.

4550:	He also believes Munson needs to play a role by providing transparent medical
data.

4551:	According to Becker's Hospital Review,
hospitals on the list received recognition for excellence from various reputable
organizations in areas such as joint replacements, orthopedic surgeries and
general orthopedic care.

4552:	"We have great depth in our program, with an
exceptional team of surgeons and supporting health care professionals.

4553:	They
provide outstanding care for our patients and are worthy of this recognition."

4554:	Becker's Hospital Review selected hospitals for inclusion based on national
rankings and awards from several institutions, including U.S. News & World
Report national and regional rankings for orthopedics, U.S. News' Common Care
ratings for hip and knee replacement, CareChex rankings for orthopedic care and
orthopedic surgery, Blue Distinction Centers for Knee and Hip Replacement,
Healthgrades orthopedic awards and Magnet designation for nursing excellence.

4555:	Note: This list is not an endorsement of included hospitals, health
systems or associated health care providers, and organizations cannot pay for
inclusion.

BRATTLEBORO - Brattleboro Memorial Hospital has received high marks from a
survey that ranked hospitals across the country.

4557:	Consumer Reports looked at six hospitals in Vermont and ranked them on a
numbered scale.

4558:	We are always striving to improve the care that is delivered," said Michele
Rowland, BMH Executive Director of Quality.

4559:	The magazine looked at 1,159 hospitals in 4-4 states in its first ever rating of
safety.

4560:	She points out that nationally recognized hospitals, such as Massachusetts
General and Cleveland Clinic, scored lowe rthan BMH even though those hospitals
are some of the premier hospitals in the world."

4561:	We do not want, in any way, to
construe that the low scores at those other hospitals mean they are not safe,"
Rowland said."

4562:	Dr. John Santa, director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center, said in
a press release that the magazine only covered 1-8 percent of the hospitals in
the country because data on patient harm is not reported consistently
nationwide. "

4563:	Hospitals that volunteer safety information, regardless of their
score, deserve credit, sincethe first step in safety is accountability," Santa
said.

4564:	"But the fact that consumers can't geta full picture of most hospitals in
the U. S. underscores the need for more public reporting."

4565:	Medicare gives hospitals an extra 2 percent on their funding if they report
safety data, but not every hospital elects to do so.

4566:	The medical staff has always been focused on delivering the
best hospital care for our patients," he said.

4567:	The 2017-18 ranking of best children's hospitals was unveiled Tuesday, with Mayo
being ranked among the top performers in 9 out of 10 pediatric specialties.

4568:	"The rankings reflect our integrated team-based care that has served as the
cornerstone of Mayo's approach to patients of all ages for more than 150 years,"
said Dr. Randall Flick, a pediatric anesthesiologist and medical director of the
Mayo Clinic Children's Center.

4569:	"We are honored to have outstanding staff who
continuously strive for excellence and to improve care for millions of patients
we treat each year from around the globe."

4570:	37 in Neonatology for 2017-18; that specialty
focuses on the medical care of newborn infants, especially the ill or premature
newborn infants.

4571:	"The Mayo Clinic Children's Center brings Mayo Clinic quality to children and
families through cutting-edge interventions, such as the Fetal Care Center,
proton beam therapy for childhood cancer, and stem cell treatment for children
with heart disease," Dr. Flick said via press release.

4572:	"Our team approach and
ability to coordinate care across specialties allows us to be able to address
health problems of all kinds and focus on the individual needs of each patient."

4573:	Mayo Clinic's pediatric facility is ranked as the top medical facility in the
Upper Midwest and its Rochester campus was ranked as the top medical facility in
the country in the 2016-17 U.S. News & World Report, which was released last
August.

4574:	Health Minister Tony Ryall has confirmed a patient ranking system for public
hospitals, similar to those already in use in Britain, will be rolled out
nationwide.

4575:	It will allow patients to score hospitals on the quality of their emergency
departments and inpatient wards and comment on what they liked or disliked,
including staff, beds and food.

4576:	Patients are surveyed and can write online reviews, giving
hospitals and clinics star ratings on cleanliness, staff co-operation, dignity
and respect, patient involvement and accommodation.

4577:	In New Zealand, the Health Quality & Safety Commission is working on a similar
but more comprehensive version of the tests for our hospitals.

4578:	"We will expect that we will be introducing this into hospitals in the middle of
next year," Ryall said.

4579:	It will provide tremendous
feedback to DHBs and their wards and their clinicians on their performance,
because it will actually tell them what their patients think and feel about the
level of service."

4580:	Individual rankings for doctors and nurses would not be included but, based on
international trends, that may happen later, Ryall said.

4581:	However, an increasing number of New Zealand doctors are already being rated
through the US-based website RateMDs.com, with more than 200 rankings on the
site.

4582:	It allows patients to score doctors out of five, with comments alongside.

4604:	Health Minister Tony Ryall has confirmed a patient ranking system for public
hospitals, similar to those already in use in Britain, will be rolled out
nationwide.

4605:	It will allow patients to score hospitals on the quality of their emergency
departments and inpatient wards and comment on what they liked or disliked,
including staff, beds and food.

4606:	Patients are surveyed and can write online reviews, giving
hospitals and clinics star ratings on cleanliness, staff co-operation, dignity
and respect, patient involvement and accommodation.

4607:	In New Zealand, the Health Quality & Safety Commission is working on a similar
but more comprehensive version of the tests for our hospitals.

New Delhi, March 5 -- A new independent analysis of the quality, safety and
efficiency of care provided by more than 3,000 hospitals across the country
rates the University of Michigan Health System in the top 100.

4615:	In the 100 Top Hospitals list released today by Truven Health Analytics, UMHS is
one of only 15 major teaching hospitals to earn a place.

4616:	U-M's ever-improving performance on measures of patient safety, health care
quality and financial stability also earned Truven's Everest Award -- given to
only 17 hospitals of any kind across the country.

4617:	"We are very proud of this honor because it recognizes our extensive efforts to
continually improve the quality and safety of care we provide to patients," says
UMHS CEO Ora Hirsch Pescovitz, M.D.

4618:	"It's gratifying to see how the hard work of our physicians and staff has
brought us to the very peak of performance in American health care, as measured
by objective data," says Doug Strong, MBA , the chief executive officer of the
U-M Hospitals and Health Centers.

4619:	Darrell Campbell, Jr., M.D., the chief medical officer for UMHS, notes that
while all these rankings and ratings are based on different combinations of
factors, they all showcase the broad-based excellence of UMHS care.

4620:	"As patients, and those who pay for their care, demand accountability and better
performance from health care providers and institutions, we're proud to reach
the top tier," he says.

4621:	"But we also know that we must constantly look for ways
to improve our performance as we seek be the safest hospital in the country."

4622:	The 100 Top Hospitals ranking is based on a broad range of data, including
information about how often patients suffered complications and preventable
patient safety incidents, how often patients were re-admitted to the hospital
soon after a hospital stay, how long patients stayed in the hospital, the cost
of hospital care adjusted for the severity of illness, and mortality rates.

4623:	The methodology used to compile the ranking has evolved to include
ever-more-precise measurement that takes into account each patient's
characteristics.

4624:	This is the latest in a series of recognitions for the high level of care that
UMHS provides to patients of all ages at its three hospitals and 40 outpatient
health centers.

4625:	In 2012, U.S. News & World Report placed U-M on its Best Hospitals national
Honor Roll for the 18th year in a row and ranked Mott high in all 10 children's
health specialties, and UMHS won the National Research Corporation's 2012
Consumer Choice Award for being patients' top choice for both the Ann Arbor and
Detroit areas.

4626:	Truven estimates that if all hospitals performed at the same level as the 100
Top Hospitals award winners, more than 164,000 additional lives could be saved,
nearly 82,000 additional patients could be complication-free, $6 billion could
be saved and the average patient stay would decrease by nearly half a day.

4627:	Since its last ranking in U.S. News, Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point has
completed a $39-million expansion, which included the addition of a three-story
cardiac care tower, an upgrade of the center's technology and a consolidation of
the cardiac services into one area of the hospital.

4628:	The magazine named 205 hospitals from all over the nation in 17 specialties.

4629:	The list is due to appear in its July 22 issue, which will be on the newsstands
Monday.

4630:	The hospitals' scores were based on reputation; the ratio of full-time, on-staff
registered nurses to beds; the number of key technologies offered and other
criteria.

4631:	"It's just recognition of the hard work done by the staff and the physicians for
taking care of the cardiology patients."

4632:	However, as I read about efforts to
"help doctors cope" with this problem, I was reminded of the well-worn but
valuable public health analogy: Better to climb to the top of the cliff to
prevent people from falling off than to hurry more ambulances to the foot of it
to treat the injured.

4633:	One interpretation of this experience is that our health care "system" is
fundamentally flawed by conflicts between expectations and resources.

4634:	For
example, in clinics, providers are being "measured" for their patients'
satisfaction, including timeliness; nevertheless, they are also expected to
"squeeze in" additional patients who have turned up without appointments.

4635:	The
electronic medical record and "home access" permits providers to spend a bit of
time with their family, then sit down to the computer to finish "documentation"
of their clinical activities of the day.

4636:	Treating the injured at the bottom of the cliff (the burned-out) is an
unsustainable approach; rather, hospitals and clinics should be trying to fix
the system that causes these problems in the first place.

4637:	Solving the problem
might be expected both to reduce costs (including those of provider replacement)
and to improve care.

4638:	Rather than undermining research at the U, Fairview's purchase
of the hospital saved it from financial disaster.

4639:	As noted in an MPR News article in 2006 (http://tinyurl.com/znhmcfw), "Before
the scandal, the medical school enjoyed an NIH funding rank in the top 15 in the
country.

4640:	I was encouraged by the Aug. 9 headline "More poor patients getting to doctor
under health care law" - if by the statement you mean that the poor are using
doctors in clinics more than using emergency rooms, that's a good thing.

4641:	If a
service (Medicaid) is free or low-cost, it will be used more, though complaints
of health care delivery remain.

4642:	The poor have never, in my 30 years of providing
health care, had a lack of opportunity to access health care.

4643:	Increased health
insurance premiums, copays and outrageous deductibles contribute to providing
health care to the poor but are pricing the middle class out of visiting
doctors.

4644:	Many middle-class families have simply foregone health insurance
altogether.

4645:	I am curious to know if middle-class insured and uninsured are reducing their
access to health care due to the increased costs, or if it is just me.

4646:	Recently,
I stepped on a rusty nail while mowing my daughter's lawn.

4647:	Sara Langer, Minneapolis

Wal-Mart not top employer;
WVU Medicine leads private-business list

For the first time since 1998, Wal-Mart is not the largest private employer in
West Virginia.

4650:	WVU Medicine, formerly known as West Virginia United Health System, rose to the
top of this year's ranking of the top private employers in the Mountain State,
according to the annual report from WorkForce West Virginia.

4651:	WVU Medicine, under its prior name, was the second-largest private employer in
the state for a decade.

4652:	Albert Wright, the president and CEO of WVU Medicine, said the name change
doesn't have anything to do with WVU Medicine's placement on the list, but its
acquisition of new hospitals and high number of new hires does.

4653:	"A lot of people say, How are you growing so fast?'

4654:	Wright said his organization made a commitment a few years ago to increase the
number of specialists the hospital system has on site, so patients wouldn't have
to drive to faraway hospitals to get the care they need.

4655:	"Over the last couple years, we've added hospitals in Buckhannon, Keyser and, on
Oct. 1, Reynolds Memorial Hospital, in Glen Dale, Wright said.

4656:	Two Huntington hospitals that are planning to merge, St. Mary's Medical Center
and Cabell Huntington Hospital, ranked seventh and eighth, respectively.

4657:	According to WorkForce West Virginia, this year's top 10 employers have 4,395
more people than last year.

4658:	The agency doesn't release employment numbers, to "maintain employer
confidentiality, according to the release.

4659:	Chelsea Ruby, director of marketing and communications for the West Virginia
Department of Commerce, said she couldn't say if WVU Medicine had more employees
this year than in years previous, or if Wal-Mart had fewer.

April 14--A health care safety report from a national nonprofit Wednesday gave
Anniston's two hospitals a "C" grade for problems during some surgeries and poor
communication between staff and patients.

4661:	Some experts say there has been a greater drive in the health care business in
recent years to improve quality and safety to earn more reimbursements from
insurers and cut costs.

4662:	The safety report, released by the Leapfrog Group, a Washington, D.C.-based
nonprofit that grades hospitals on errors, accidents and infections, ranked
2,639 U.S. hospitals.

4663:	Of those, 823 earned an "A," 706 earned a "B," 933 earned
a "C," 167 earned a "D" and 10 earned an "F."

Deirdre McCaughey, program director for graduate programs in health care quality
and safety at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said Leapfrog was a
credible organization.

4664:	For
instance, the report shows RMC had more patient deaths from serious but
treatable conditions than the average among the other hospitals surveyed.

4665:	RMC
was also worse than the average for allowing surgical wound stitching to tear,
blood clots and accidental cuts and tears among patients.

4666:	"RMC is constantly striving to improve in all aspects of quality and patient
safety and we have made significant progress over the last several years," Bass
wrote.

4667:	"All of which include overall quality measures for patient safety outcomes,"
Bass wrote.

4668:	Meanwhile, Stringfellow earned its ranking more for its physicians and nurses
having insufficient communication with patients.

4669:	McCaughey said the pressure to improve quality and safety at hospitals has
continually increased in the last decade.

4670:	"No time in health care until somewhat recently has there been such an emphasis
on quality," McCaughey said.

4671:	The push began around 2007, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid started
restructuring some of its treatment reimbursements to health care providers,
offering higher payouts based off quality rankings and outcomes.

4672:	Don Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said Blue Cross
and other private insurers also started tying payouts to quality, which
encouraged more improvement at hospitals.

4673:	"There's been a much more visible effort to improve quality and most
importantly, measuring that, among hospitals," Williamson said.

4674:	"Payers are
interested in reducing cost and avoiding unnecessary admissions."

4675:	Over 4,000 hospitals from
across the country were ranked in the Overall Hospital Care category which
comprises ratings of all2 inpatient medical conditions and surgical procedures
treated and performed by full-service hospitals, such as cancer care, cardiac
surgery and spinal surgery.

4676:	This prestigious distinction encompasses three quality measures:
patient safety indicators, mortality rates and complication rates.

4677:	Utilizing extensive clinical data from the Hospital Quality Alliance and the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CareChex provides a comprehensive
evaluation of all components of medical quality including:

* Process of care - measures specific processes that should be followed during
heart attack and heart failure, pneumonia, outpatient procedures, surgical care
and preventive care, among others.

4678:	* Outcomes of care - measures mortality and complication rates, inpatient
quality indicators and patient safety indicators

* Patient satisfaction - measures overall hospital ratings, doctor and nurse
communication, hospital environment, and staff responsiveness, among others.

4679:	CareChex provides these findings to consumers, providers and purchasers of U.S.
medical care, including many Fortune 500 companies.

4680:	"CareChex allows the public to make informed decisions regarding the quality of
medical care provided by hospitals," said Dr. Thane Forthman, President and CEO,
CareChex a division of Comparion.

4681:	"We are pleased to acknowledge that Ochsner
Medical Center has achieved an exceptionally high level of performance across
all components of medical quality.

4682:	Ochsner's performance is a benchmark that
other hospitals should seek to emulate."

4683:	"What matters most to us are positive outcomes for our patients.

4684:	We want
our patients to get the best possible care so they can go home sooner and get
back to their lives and families."

4685:	"We are honored to have our programs named among the best in the country by
CareChex, which is used by some of the largest companies in the nation in order
to make informed healthcare decisions," said Warner Thomas, President and CEO,
Ochsner Health System.

4686:	"Each and every member of Ochsner's team is relentlessly
focused on quality and understands that it is part of their responsibility to
make sure our patients have the best possible outcomes.

4687:	I am extremely proud of
the physicians and clinical teams who provide such exceptional care to our
patients every day."

4688:	"As our transplant program continues to grow both regionally and nationally, we
remain committed to providing the best service and care for our patients," said
Dr. Nigel Girgrah, PhD, Head of Hepatology, Medical Director of the Multi-Organ
Transplant Institute.

4689:	"We work with so many patients and families over long
periods of time, so we know what a difference a successful transplant can make
in someone's life.

Cuomo takes on Empire, HIP/GHI on doc ranking

Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is targeting two of Long Island's biggest health
insurance companies in his ongoing scrutiny of doctor-ranking programs.

4691:	An Oct. 18 letter sent by the AG to Empire said physician-ranking programs run
by insurers could be a conflict of interest, "because of the insurers' financial
motive to steer consumers to the cheapest, and not necessarily the best,
doctors. "

4692:	The letter also says Empire's program could be "driven by the desire
to save money for the insurer" and "not necessarily designed with the best
interest of consumers in mind. "

4693:	Greiner said Empire would not release quality
and cost data "until we are comfortable that we have appropriately addressed
questions raised by stakeholders such as New York consumers, employers,
physicians and regulators, including the New York attorney general. "

It may not be the richest hospital on the planet, but Nassau University Medical
Center is hyping its efforts to stay on the "cutting edge of health-care
technology," in the words of Arthur Gianelli, president and chief executive of
Nassau Health Care Corp.

NUMC has implemented a new picture-archiving and communication system that
allows staff to digitize and transmit medical images such as ultrasounds and
X-rays.

4695:	The hospital also recently went live with a document-scanning system
that enables staff to view medical records electronically, part of an industry
trend toward digitizing medical records.

4696:	A total of 2 percent of the hospital's annual budget is spent on IT -
approximately $5 million, according to hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg.

4697:	In addition, NUMC received $1.8 million this year to update IT systems through
the state's Health Care Efficiency and Affordability Law, Lotenberg said.

Moffitt Ranks In Most Wired Survey

TAMPA - The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute has been named by
Hospitals & Health Networks in partnership with the American Hospital
Association, Accenture, McKesson Healthcare and CHIME as one of "100 most wired
hospitals and health systems" in the United States.

4700:	The Most Wired Survey identifies 100 hospitals and health systems that have
adopted information technology to streamline business and clinical practices,
improve patient outcomes, and decrease the occurrence of medical errors.

4701:	The
survey assesses a hospital's adoption and use of technology in five key areas:
safety and quality, customer service, business processes, work force, and public
health and safety.

4702:	It also recognizes
lifetime achievement and service to the air medical community.

4703:	Carrubba has been with Tampa General for nearly 20 years and has been Aeromed's
medical director since its inception in 1989.

4704:	She also serves as Hillsborough
County's mass casualty director and Tampa Fire Rescue's medical director.

Patients can now pull up a Web site to compare how virtually every hospital in
America performed in treating certain key diseases, health officials announced
Friday.

4710:	Within a year, the site also will
include rankings on other categories, such as patient satisfaction and hospital
-acquired infection, he said.

4711:	"It is a next step down a
very important road toward Medicare moving from simply paying for medical
services to supporting high-quality care that keeps getting better."

4712:	At
this stage, they probably have more to do with how well hospitals are
documenting care and improving their systems for handling patients, said William
Farr, the chief medical officer for University Health Care System.

4713:	"I believe right now it's more helpful to the providers than to the patients,"
he said.

4714:	A year after the rankings were introduced, hospitals have had a chance to make
changes so that their current numbers are much higher, said Becky Echols, the
performance improvement/regulatory standards manager at St. Joseph Hospital.

4715:	But the rankings and the public Web site now give hospitals yet another
incentive to improve care, said Patricia Sodomka, the senior vice president for

Cincy Children's ranks 3rd;
National rating is for pediatric hospitals.U.S.

Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center ranks third best in the nation
among pediatric hospitals on U.S. News & World Report's 2013-2014 list released
Tuesday.

4725:	U.S. News & World Report named 10 hospitals, including Cincinnati, to the Honor
Roll of its annual ranking.

4726:	The national news magazine evaluated hospitals on 10
specialities.

4727:	The hospitals on the honor roll excel in at least three of the 10
specialty categories, according to the news magazine.

4728:	U.S. News surveyed 179 pediatric hospitals and 1,500 physicians to come up with
the list.

4729:	Eighty-seven hospitals ranked in at least one specialty.

4730:	A smaller proportion of the
rankings considered reputation, asking doctors which hospital they would send
the sickest children in their specialty to regardless of location.

4731:	Cincinnati Children's ranked first for pediatric cancer; second for nephrology
and pulmonology; and third among pediatric hospitals nationwide for
gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery, orthopedics, and urology, U.S.
News & World Report said.

4732:	Quality, safety
data and patient satisfaction scores can be found on the Dayton pediatric
hospital's website, spokeswoman Kelly Kavanaugh said.

4733:	Edward Hospital was ranked first in Illinois for cardiology services by the
independent health care ratings organization HealthGrades in a national study
released last week.

4734:	And for patients, that basically means the hospital has a
strong track record of fixing patients so conditions such as heart attacks and
heart failure do not cause them to die, said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, Edward
Hospital's medical director of cardiovascular services.

4735:	And the hospital's ranking as first in the state for cardiology services is a
shared honor for paramedics, emergency room doctors and surgeons alike, Bufalino
said.

4736:	The annual HealthGrades Hospital Quality in America study analyzed patient
outcomes from Medicare

hospitalization records between 2007 and 2009 at nearly 5,000 hospitals in the
nation to determine mortality rates for different conditions and rank hospitals
based on those rates.

4737:	Aside from its first-in-Illinois ranking for cardiology services, Edward placed
in the top 5 percent in the nation in three categories: cardiology services,
overall cardiac services and coronary interventional procedures.

4738:	The national
rankings further recognize the hospital's ability to keep patients' hearts
beating, Bufalino said.

4739:	"It's hard to believe in less than six months, I'm back to living life like I
always have."

Feb. 23--McALLEN -- Rio Grande Regional Hospital and Valley Regional Medical
Center in Brownsville are rated in the top 5 percent of hospitals in the nation
due to their low mortality and complication rates, according to a nationally
recognized health care ratings company.

4741:	The hospitals received the 2006 Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical
Excellence based on a three-year study by HealthGrades Inc.

4742:	The Colorado-based
organization provides ratings and profiles of hospitals, nursing homes and
physicians to consumers, corporations, health plans and hospitals.

4743:	HealthGrades examined 39 million Medicare hospitalization records at 5,122
hospitals between 2002 and 2004.

4744:	The top hospitals had mortality and
complication rates for 26 procedures and diagnoses -- including bypass surgery
and

hip-replacement surgery -- 27 percent lower than other facilities.

4745:	But their rankings should not be viewed as the sole health care rankings source,
said Texas Hospital Association spokeswoman Amanda Engler.

WHILE DEMOCRATS and Republicans debate the merits of -Obamacare, cost-sharing
subsidies and out-of-pocket expenses, a mother in the Bronx is trying to
determine the best place to get cancer treatment for her kid.

4750:	For her, the health care issue isn't a political tennis match where the ball
ends up bouncing in some ideological court.

4751:	Luckily, she has a road map - the U.S. News & World Report annual hospital
rankings - a practical guide to the best health care in New York City and
beyond.

4752:	Among the hospitals in excellent health are New York-Presbyterian, Mount Sinai
and NYU Langone Medical Center.

4753:	We are proud to be recognized as one of the
best hospitals in the country."

4754:	Matthew Fink, New York-Presbyterian's neurologist-in-chief, added, "For us, it's
always been asking what's next on the horizon.

4755:	Some of the city's specialty hospitals also fared extremely well.

4756:	"We are delighted and honored once again to be one of the nation's top hospitals
for cancer," said Memorial Sloan Kettering President and CEO Craig Thompson.

4757:	"But this recognition is really a reflection of an entire community of
exceptional people - our dedicated staff of almost 16,000 and our patients, who
have placed their trust in our care.

4758:	We may be one of the top hospitals in the
national rankings for this year, but our patients are No.

4759:	Although the rankings are a feather in the hospitals' caps, and a powerful
recruitment tool, the good grades play a bigger role in helping patients decide
where to get the best treatment.

4760:	"It all depends on what your diagnosis or medical need is," said Ben Harder,
chief of health analysis at U.S. News & World Report.

4761:	Whether it's a mobile stroke unit dispatched from New York-Presbyterian, spine
treatment at the Hospital for Special Surgery or cancer care at Memorial Sloan
Kettering, the best hospitals have the same goals - quality care and peace of
mind for their patients.

4762:	"But what shouldn't be lost sight of is that New York City
has a plethora of good hospitals.

4763:	They should read the conclusion of the investigators, namely that Baidu's paid
rankings, from which it profited by listing search results according to the

million pieces of paid information, which come from 2,518 medical institutions.

4765:	Merely canceling the paid medical listings is not enough.

4766:	As Baidu remains a monopoly in the domestic search
engine market, paid listings on its webpages might adversely influence many
patients, and help unqualified hospitals prosper.

4767:	More importantly, the investigators did not define paid ranking as advertising.

4768:	Actually, Baidu takes money from hospitals and mixes their information with
normal search results, with only very small indications to alert viewers to the
fact they are paid rankings.

4769:	Consumers that are misguided by Baidu's paid rankings should
have the right to take the company to court.

4777:	The A&E team at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds managed to see, treat
and discharge 99.9% of all patients within four hours for the week ending
February 27.

4778:	The
national A&E target is to see, treat and release 95% of patients.

4779:	The news comes as staff at the hospital herald three months of continued
improvement against the four-hour target compared with the same period last
year.

4780:	Health chiefs say their success is down to a range of measures introduced
recently.

4781:	They include appointing additional consultants in the Emergency Assessment Unit
(EAU) so that short-stay patients remain under the care of the same consultant
throughout their entire admission; creating dedicated short-stay beds for
patients who need hospital care for less than 48 hours; changing shift patterns
so that extra doctors and emergency nurse practitioners are available to work
within A&E; increasing planning to improve handovers between wards; liaising
more closely with health and social care staff working within the community to
manage discharges more effectively.

4782:	The rankings come despite the hospital having to deal with an 8% year-to-date
increase in the number of patients coming to A&E.

4783:	Stephen Graves, hospital chief executive, said: "This significant improvement is
fantastic news for our patients and shows they are receiving timely access to
good-quality, effective care.

4784:	"What makes this achievement even more noteworthy is that it has come at a time
when the number of patients using West Suffolk Hospital has continued to
increase, which in turn places more emphasis on working effectively and
efficiently.

4785:	"Although we are delighted with these figures, we will not become complacent and
will continue to look for ways in which we can improve our services still
further.

4786:	Overall, for the month of February, the hospital managed to see, treat and
discharge 98.6% of its patients within four hours.

Star rating system proposed for hospitals;
Academic urges public rankings

BYLINE: CAROL NADER, HEALTH REPORTER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

4788:	8

LENGTH: 510 words


HOSPITALS should be given star ratings based on factors such as death and
infection rates, to improve performance and help patients make better informed
choices, a leading health academic says.

4789:	Giving the best hospitals a five-star rating would be one option.

4790:	Another would
be a league table ranking the best and worst performing hospitals, according to
La Trobe University dean of health sciences, Hal Swerissen

Hospitals could be rated as above, below or at acceptable standards.

4791:	Professor Swerissen, a senior adviser to Carmen Lawrence when she was federal
health minister, said areas that could be rated included surgery mortality
rates, medical errors, readmission rates and negligence when a court had found
the hospital was at fault.

4792:	He said public reporting would improve the quality of the health system and
could reduce complications and mishaps.

4793:	"I am very keen to see the health system have much stronger reporting on patient
outcomes," he said.

4794:	The State Government releases each year a report on "sentinel events", in which
serious errors are reported, but the information does not identify hospitals.

4795:	The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare yesterday released a report on
medical indemnity, which also did not identify hospitals.

4796:	Professor Swerissen said the proposed system would help hospitals to know their
status in terms of quality and where they needed to improve.

4797:	He said hospitals had a different mix of patients, which needed to be factored
in to how they were ranked.

4798:	"I think the public are entitled to know where their money is going and how
effectively it's being spent, and I also think it helps patients make more
informed decisions and choices between hospitals," he said.

4799:	Deakin University dean of
health sciences John Catford said league tables could have a demoralising effect
on hospitals and might not be helpful.

4800:	He said hospitals might be prompted to choose patients who were more likely to
get well, to improve their rating.

4801:	The Australian Medical Association Victorian branch president, Mark Yates, also
believed the proposal could give hospitals a "perverse incentive" to
discriminate against patients at greater risk of dying.

4802:	A three-year effort to improve patient care, safety and satisfaction earned
University of Utah Health Care the top spot in the University HealthSystem
Consortium's 2010 Quality and Accountability Study, one of the most rigorous
hospital rankings in the country.

4803:	But the consortium's report judged the university's health system -- its
hospital, clinics and medical school, Moran Eye Center and Huntsman Cancer
Institute -- against 98 of the nation's elite academic medical centers.

4804:	It
ranks institutions on patient safety and satisfaction, mortality rates and
re-admissions using benchmarks endorsed by the Institute of Medicine.

4805:	The consortium doesn't release data gathered
from institutions; it instead uses a five-star system to rank health centers.

4806:	For Thomas Miller, the university's chief medical officer, the U.

4807:	Getting there meant researching and adopting new and improved clinical
practices.

4808:	And it took aligning everyone around the same goals, from vice presidents to
doctors, nurses and medical students, Miller said.

4809:	But upon closer look, it became apparent that physicians and nurses were
neglecting to document the fact that patients were transferring to the U. for
end-of-life care.

4810:	The mortality index is meant to show how often reasonably healthy patients die
due to complications in their treatment.

U-M Doctor Training Programs Rank Among Best in Nation, New National Survey

LENGTH: 669  words


Sept. 10 -- University of Michigan (U-M) Health System issued the following news
release:

Doctors nationwide rate the University of Michigan Health System as one of the
best places for young doctors to train in their chosen field, across 20 medical
specialties, according to a new ranking released today.

4812:	And for new
doctors seeking to train at large public hospitals, U-M ranked even higher.

4813:	Three specialties - otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat), pathology and surgery
-- ranked at number one in the country among programs at such hospitals.

4814:	The release of the rankings comes just as this year's class of graduating
medical students prepares to apply for their residency spots, through a national
system that allows them to rank their preferred training sites, and interview at
those that select them for consideration.

4815:	In addition to the rankings, Doximity is offering medical students and
physicians access to additional data on each residency program in the 20 ranked
specialties, such as the percentage of residency alumni who went on to
sub-specialize, and the rank of past trainees in publication of research
findings.

4816:	Currently, more than 1,199 residents are training in their specialty while
helping to care for patients at U-M's Hospitals and Health Centers, under the
supervision of U-M Medical School faculty physicians.

4817:	Additional facts about UMHS residency programs:

Some UMHS residency programs also give trainees the chance to learn and provide
care at partner hospitals, including the VA Ann Arbor Health Care System, St.
Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor Hospital, St. Joseph Mercy Chelsea Hospital and Hurley
Medical Center in Flint.

4818:	The reputation of UMHS training programs attracts a large number of medical
residents and fellows (advanced residents) from other states, who move to
Michigan for three to seven years of training.

4819:	UMHS patients benefit from the expertise of residents and fellows, as well as
the faculty physicians who supervise them.

4820:	About one-third of UMHS residents are
doing second or third residencies in complex specialties available at few other
hospitals.

4821:	After residency, doctors tend to practice near where they trained.

4822:	In recognition of the importance of this training, state and federal governments
provide funds to teaching hospitals such as UMHS, to offset the costs associated
with involving residents in patient care while also training them.

4823:	Disclaimer: The full release can be found at:
(http://www.uofmhealth.org/news/archive/201409/u-m-doctor-training-programs-rank
-among-best-nation).

4824:	Over 4,000 hospitals from
across the country were ranked in the Overall Hospital Care category which
comprises ratings of all2 inpatient medical conditions and surgical procedures
treated and performed by full-service hospitals, such as cancer care, cardiac
surgery and spinal surgery.

4825:	This prestigious distinction encompasses three quality measures:
patient safety indicators, mortality rates and complication rates.

4826:	Utilizing extensive clinical data from the Hospital Quality Alliance and the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CareChex provides a comprehensive
evaluation of all components of medical quality including:

* Process of care - measures specific processes that should be followed during
heart attack and heart failure, pneumonia, outpatient procedures, surgical care
and preventive care, among others.

4827:	* Outcomes of care - measures mortality and complication rates, inpatient
quality indicators and patient safety indicators

* Patient satisfaction - measures overall hospital ratings, doctor and nurse
communication, hospital environment, and staff responsiveness, among others.

4828:	CareChex provides these findings to consumers, providers and purchasers of U.S.
medical care, including many Fortune 500 companies.

4829:	"CareChex allows the public to make informed decisions regarding the quality of
medical care provided by hospitals," said Dr. Thane Forthman, President and CEO,
CareChex a division of Comparion.

4830:	"We are pleased to acknowledge that Ochsner
Medical Center has achieved an exceptionally high level of performance across
all components of medical quality.

4831:	Ochsner's performance is a benchmark that
other hospitals should seek to emulate."

4832:	"What matters most to us are positive outcomes for our patients.

4833:	We want
our patients to get the best possible care so they can go home sooner and get
back to their lives and families."

4834:	"We are honored to have our programs named among the best in the country by
CareChex, which is used by some of the largest companies in the nation in order
to make informed healthcare decisions," said Warner Thomas, President and CEO,
Ochsner Health System.

4835:	"Each and every member of Ochsner's team is relentlessly
focused on quality and understands that it is part of their responsibility to
make sure our patients have the best possible outcomes.

4836:	I am extremely proud of
the physicians and clinical teams who provide such exceptional care to our
patients every day."

4837:	"As our transplant program continues to grow both regionally and nationally, we
remain committed to providing the best service and care for our patients," said
Dr. Nigel Girgrah, PhD, Head of Hepatology, Medical Director of the Multi-Organ
Transplant Institute.

4838:	"We work with so many patients and families over long
periods of time, so we know what a difference a successful transplant can make
in someone's life.

Fierce Health Inc has issued the following news release:

The top hospitals in America have in common a combination of collaboration,
evidence-based decisions and vision, according to the latest rankings released
by Healthgrades.

4840:	The annual list ranks both the top 50 hospitals in America--those scoring in the
top 1 percent of hospitals for wide-ranging clinical excellence for at least six
consecutive years--and the top 100 hospitals--those scoring in the top 2 percent
of hospitals for wide-ranging clinical excellence for at least three consecutive
years.

DATELINE: HUDSON


After ranking 27th last year, Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point is off U.S
News & World Report's 2003 list of best hospitals for heart care and heart
surgery.

4842:	The magazine's 14th annual rankings name the top 203 hospitals nationwide in 17
specialties.

4843:	No Tampa Bay area hospitals made the
list in the category.

4844:	Last week Solucient, a company that analyzes health care data, ranked Bayonet
Point among 2002's Top 100 hospitals for cardiovascular care.

4845:	"We're always striving to be better at all times," said LRHC CEO Larry Schulz.

4846:	In it, LRHC scored a safety rating of 62
out of 100, placing it eighth out of the 36 Minnesota hospitals ranked by the
magazine (even outscoring the Mayo Clinic location in Mankato).

4847:	Though the majority of Minnesota's almost 150 hospitals went unranked due to
lack of information, other ranked hospitals close to Fergus Falls include St.
Joseph's Medical Center in Brainerd (64), Douglas County Hospital in Alexandria
(61), Sanford Bemidji Medical Center (50) and St. Mary's Hospital in Detroit
Lakes (37).

4848:	"Regardless of what the rankings are, I think safety is always a high priority
of ours," Schulz remarked.

4849:	Since readmissions in
hospitals can often mean that there was a problem during the initial stay,
RARE's goal is to encourage hospital practices that will result in 4,000 fewer
avoidable hospital readmissions from July 2011 to December 2012 -- a 20 percent
drop in the state's readmission numbers.

4850:	As such, LRHC encourages
patients to ask questions about their post-hospital treatment, and it sends out
health care professionals to check on some people who have complicated
medication regimens.

4851:	As the hospital's chief "infection preventionist,"
Bowman's job has many facets: she educates staff on the procedures they need to
follow to avoid in-hospital infections, she makes sure those procedures are
being followed, she tracks information on infections in the hospital, and she
investigates the circumstances surrounding any infection that occurs.

4852:	"You either use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your hands in a sink
when you come to work, when you come into a patient room, before you touch a
patient, after (taking) a pair of gloves off, and after touching a patient," she
said, noting that those steps alone go a long way in reducing infections.

4853:	Another way the hospital reduces infections is through a series of practices
called "bundles."

4854:	When conducting a surgical procedure, all involved staff
follow a series of steps to make sure the surgery site remains sterile.

4855:	One of the most sensitive procedures involves the placement of a central line IV
-- an IV that is routed to the chest.

4856:	Since central line infections can
essentially result in blood poisoning, the bundle for central line procedures is
in-depth, involving a draped area, sterilized gloves and gowns, masks, head
coverings and a daily check on the IV entry point.

4857:	"Our patients are older and sicker, and the older you are and the sicker you are
and the more medical problems you have, the higher your risk of infection," said
Bowman.

4858:	Her response and LRHC's response is to work even harder to find ways to take the
risk out of hospital stays.

R.I. hospitals tops for heart treatment

BYLINE: By Felice J. Freyer

LENGTH: 1075 words



Rhode Island hospitals are leading the pack nationwide in measurements of how
well they treat heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia.

4860:	According to new federal data on more than 4,200 hospitals around the country,
Rhode Island's 10 acute-care hospitals -- as a group -- rank number one overall
in how often they take certain steps known to produce the best outcomes for the
three conditions studied.

4861:	That doesn't necessarily mean that Rhode Island has the best hospitals.

4862:	The
measures focused on narrowly defined aspects of care, not everything that a
hospital does.

4863:	But the state's high ranking does reflect the success of the
hospitals' longstanding efforts, instigated by a 1998 state law, to work on
those measures of quality.

4864:	"We certainly are a shining star when you look at the comparison across the
country," said Marcia K. Petrillo, chief executive officer of Quality Partners
of Rhode Island, an agency hired by the federal government to monitor and
improve the care of Medicare beneficiaries. "

4865:	Overall the Rhode Island
hospitals are providing some of the best care in the country, for these
conditions."

4866:	"I think we have some of the better hospitals in the country," agreed Dr. David
R. Gifford, the acting state health director who was previously medical director
at Quality Partners.

4867:	The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last week unveiled Hospital
Compare (www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov), a new Web tool that compares how often
some 4,200 hospitals around the country followed widely accepted guidelines for
the care of heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia.

4868:	The state has been publishing the same information about Rhode Island hospitals
since 2002, but this is the first time that meaningful national comparisons have
been available.

4869:	The federal government did not study how patients fared -- whether they died or
got better -- because the severity of a patient's condition can affect the
outcome as much as what the hospital does.

4870:	Instead, the government looked at
"the process of care," identifying 17 actions that have been proven to increase
a patient's likelihood of surviving those three conditions.

4871:	Those actions include giving heart-attack patients aspirin and beta blockers
upon arrival, treating heart-failure patients with ACE inhibitors (drugs that
reduce the heart's workload), and giving pneumonia patients antibiotics within
four hours of arrival.

4872:	The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services offered hospitals a 0.4 percent
increase in reimbursement if they would report how often they met 10 of the
guidelines, and nearly all complied.

4873:	Rhode Island hospitals had gotten a head start in this effort thanks to 1998
state law, filed by Lt. Gov.

4874:	Charles J. Fogarty during his last term in the
state Senate, which required the Health Department to measure and report on the
quality of care in every health-care institution.

4875:	The department started with
hospitals.

4876:	Eventually Rhode Island became one of seven states in a pilot project
testing the procedures for collecting and reporting the data.

4877:	Hospitals in Rhode Island, as a group, ranked above the national average on each
of the 10 measures and took first place in five of them.

4878:	Rhode Island's
hospitals were weakest in meeting the guidelines calling for elderly patients to
be vaccinated against pneumonia and to receive an antibiotic within four hours.

4879:	"Rhode Island hospitals worked together collaboratively from the get-go," said
Health Director Gifford.

4880:	[The high
ranking] shows that they responded to this initiative and did a good job."

4881:	The federal government has billed Hospital Compare as a tool for consumers to
choose a hospital, but Gifford doesn't agree with that.

4882:	Such data is more useful
as a prod to get hospitals to improve.

4883:	"

The differences among hospitals aren't significant enough to justify traveling
farther for a better one, he said.

4884:	But, he said, consumers can use Hospital
Compare to become educated about the care they should receive and check with
doctors to make sure that they're getting it.

4885:	Rhode Island also shines in a different computer-based snapshot of health-care
quality, which was released Monday.

4886:	The federal Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality ranked the states on 14 criteria, such as the percentage of adults
over 50 who receive colonoscopies and the percentage of home-health patients who
had to be hospitalized.

4887:	The state also had the
third lowest percentage of nursing home patients who were in moderate to severe
pain.

4888:	Gifford said the state's high ranking on controlling pain among nursing home
residents resulted from a concerted effort by several groups, including Brown
University and Quality Partners, to help nursing homes develop ways to diagnose
and alleviate pain.

4889:	"What you're seeing in these 14 measures," said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, AHRQ
director, "is shared accountability across health professions.

4890:	The buck
doesn't stop at any precisely defined point.

symptoms to diagnosis and treatment; treat patients more quickly during the
critical window of time when the integrity of the heart muscle can be preserved;
and monitor patients when it is not certain that they are having a heart attack
in order to ensure that they are not sent home too quickly or needlessly
admitted to the hospital.
